<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>"And Cain went out from before the face of God, and dwelt in the land of Nod, opposite to Eden." <ref n="286.1"/> Now we may raise the question whether we are to take the expressions which occur in the books that have been handed down to us by Moses and to interpret them in a somewhat metaphorical sense, while the ideas which readily present themselves as derived from the names are very deficient in truth.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>For if the living God has a face, and if he who desires to leave it can with perfect ease rise
<note n="286.1">Genesis iv. 16. </note>
<pb n="287"/>
up and depart to another place, why do we repudiate the impiety of the Epicureans, or the godlessness of the Egyptians, or the mythical suggestions of which life is full?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>For the face is a portion of an animal; but God is a whole, not a part: so that it becomes necessary to invent for him other parts also, a neck, and a chest, <choice><sic>and bauds,</sic><corr>and hands,</corr></choice> and moreover a belly, feet, and generative organs, and all the rest of the countless number of internal and external faculties.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>And the fact of God's having passions like unto those of man follows of necessity from the fact of his having a form like that of man: since all those limbs are not superfluous and mere exuberances, but have been made by nature as assistants of the weakness of those who possess them, and she has adapted them in a manner suitable to and consistent with their natural necessities and offices. But the living God has need of nothing; so that as he does not at all require the assistance to be derived from the parts of the <choice><sic>body, he7</sic><corr>body, he</corr></choice> cannot possibly have such parts at all.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>And from whence does Cain go forth? is it from the palace of the ruler of the world? But what house of God can exist perceptible by the outward senses except <choice><sic>this world.</sic><corr>this world</corr></choice> which it is impossible and impracticable to quit? For the great circle of the heaven binds round and contains within itself everything which has ever been created; and of those things which have already perished, the component parts are resolved into their original elements, and are again portioned off among those powers of the universe of which they consist, the loan which, as it were, was advanced to each, being restored back at unequal <choice><sic>periods of.</sic><corr>periods of</corr></choice> time, in accordance with laws previously laid down, to the nature which originally made it, whenever that nature chooses to call in its debts.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>Again, if any person goes out from any place, that which he leaves behind him is in a different place from that in which he now is, but if this be true it must follow that there are some portions of <choice><sic>the universe:</sic><corr>the universe</corr></choice> deprived of the presence of God, who never leaves any place empty or destitute of himself, but who fills up all things for all time;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>and if God has not a face (inasmuch as he is not bound by what may seem appropriate for created things), and if he does not exist in parts inasmuch as he surrounds all things and is not surrounded by any, it is impossible for anything to remove and depart from this world as from a city, as there is no portion of it left without.
<pb n="288"/>
It now remains for us, considering that none of these things are spoken of in terms of strict propriety, to turn to the allegorical system, which is dear to men versed in natural philosophy, taking the first principles of our argument from this source.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>If it is hard to depart from before the face and out of the sight of a mortal king, how can it be anything but extremely difficult to depart and quit the appearance of God, and to determine no longer to come into his sight. This indeed is to be left without any idea of him, and to be mutilated as to the eyes of the soul,</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>and all those who of necessity have endured this fate, being weighed down by the might of irresistible and implacable power, are objects rather for pity than for hatred; but all those who voluntarily and of deliberated purposes have rejected the living God, exceeding even the bounds of wickedness itself, for what other evil of equal weight can possibly be found? Such men should suffer not the usual punishments of evil doers, but something new and extraordinary. And surely no one could invent a more novel or more terrible penalty than a departure and flight from the presence of the Ruler of the universe.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Accordingly God banished Adam; but Cain went forth from his presence of his own accord; Moses here showing to us the manner of each sort of absence from God, both the voluntary and the involuntary sort; but the involuntary sort as not existing in consequence of any intention on our part, will subsequently have such a remedy applied to it as the case admits of; for God will raise up another offspring in the place of Abel, whom Cain slew, a male offspring for the soul which has not turned by its own intention, by name Seth, which name being interpreted means irrigation;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>but the voluntary flight from God, as one that has taken place by deliberate purpose and intention, will await on irremediable punishment in all eternity, for as good deeds that are done in consequence of forethought and design, are better than unintentional ones, so also among offences those that are undesigned are of less heinousness than those that are premeditated.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>Therefore punishment which is the chastiser of impious men, will await Cain who has now departed from before the face of God, but Moses will suggest to those who know God, a most excellent suggestion, to love God and to obey

him, and cleave to him, for he tells men that this is the life which in truth is tranquil and lasting, <ref n="289.1"/> and he very emphatically invites us to the honour of the one being who is above all others to be beloved and honoured, bidding us cleave to him, recommending to us a continual and constant and inseparable harmony and union of friendship with him.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>These suggestions and such as these are what he gives to the rest of the world, but he himself so insatiably desires to behold him, and to be beheld by him, that he supplicates him to display to his eye his nature of which it is impossible to form a conjecture, so that he may become acquainted with it, <ref n="289.2"/> that thus he might receive a most well-grounded certainty of knowledge that could not be mistaken, in exchange for uncertain doubts; and he will never cease from urging his desire, but even, <choice><sic>though be</sic><corr>though he</corr></choice> is aware that he desires a matter which is difficult of attainment, or rather which is wholly <choice><sic>unattainable, be</sic><corr>unattainable, he</corr></choice> still strives on, in no way remitting his intense anxiety, but without admitting any excuse, or any hesitation, or vacillation; using all the means in his power to gain his object.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>At all events, he will now penetrate <corr>into "the</corr> darkness where God was." <ref n="289.3"/> That is to say, into those unapproachable and invisible conceptions which are formed of the living God. For the great Cause of all things does not exist in time, nor at all in place, but he is superior to both time and place; for, having made all created things in subjection to himself, he is surrounded by nothing, but he is superior to everything. And being superior to, and being also external to the world that he has <choice><sic>made, be</sic><corr>made, he</corr></choice> nevertheless fills the whole world with himself; for, having by his own power extended it to its utmost limits, he has connected every portion with another portion according to the principles of harmony.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>When, therefore, the soul that loves God seeks to know what the one living God is according to his essence, it is entering upon an obscure and dark subject of investigation, from which the greatest benefit that arises to it is to comprehend that God, as to his essence, is utterly incomprehensible to any being, and also to be aware that he is invisible.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>And it appears to me that the <choice><sic>great bierophant</sic><corr>great hierophant</corr></choice> <choice><sic>bad attained</sic><corr>had attained</corr></choice> to the comprehension of the most important point in this investigation before he commenced it, when he entreated God to become

the exhibitor and expounder of his own nature to him, <ref n="290.1"/> for he says, "Show me thyself;" showing very plainly by this expression that no created being is competent by himself to learn the nature of God in his essence.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>On this account too, Abraham, when he had come unto the place which God had told him <corr>of, "On</corr> the third day, looking up, saw the place afar off." <ref n="290.2"/> What kind of place? Was it the place to which he came? And how was it still afar off, if he had already come to it?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>But perhaps the meaning which is intended under this expression may be something <corr>like this:—The</corr> wise man, being always desirous to comprehend the nature of the Ruler of the universe, when he is proceeding along the road which leads by knowledge and wisdom, previously meets with words of God, among which he rests for a while; and though he had previously determined to proceed by some other road, he now stops and hesitates; for the eyes of his mind being opened, he sees more clearly that he had entered upon a chase after a thing which was difficult to overtake, which constantly retreated before him, and was always at a distance, and which outstripped its pursuers by placing an immeasurable distance between them.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>You think, therefore, rightly that all the speediest things which are under heaven would appear to be standing still if compared with the rapidity of the sun, and moon, and other stars. And yet the whole heaven was made by God; and the maker always goes before that which is made. So that, of necessity, not only the other things which exist among us, but also that which has the most rapid motion of all, namely, the mind, may fall short of a proper comprehension of the great cause of all things by an undescribable distance.
But the stars, as they are themselves in motion, pass by all things that move; but, though it seems incredible, God, while standing still, outstrips everything.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>And it is said that he, at the same moment, is close to us and at a great distance, touching us with his creative or his punishing powers, which are close to each individual, and yet at the same time driving away the creature to an excessive distance from his nature as existing according to its essence, so that it cannot touch him without even the unalloyed and incorporeal efforts of the intellect.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p>Therefore we sympathise in joy with those who love God and
<note n="290.1">Exodus xxxiii. 12. </note>
<note n="290.2">Genesis xxii. 4. </note>
<pb n="291"/>
seek to understand the nature of the living God, even if they fail to discover it; for the vague investigation of what is good is sufficient by itself to cheer the heart, even if it fail to attain the end that it desires. But we participate in indignation against that lover of himself, Cain; because he has left his soul without any conception whatever of the living God, having of deliberate purpose mutilated himself of that faculty by which alone he might have been able to see him.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="22">
<p>It is worth while also to consider the wickedness into which a man who flies from the face of God is driven, since it is called a tempest. The law-giver showing, by this expression, that he who gives way to inconsiderate impulses without any stability or firmness exposes himself to surf and violent tossing, like those of the sea, when it is agitated in the winter season by contrary winds, and has never even a single glimpse of calm or tranquillity. But as when a ship having been tossed in the sea is agitated, it is then no longer fit to take a voyage or to anchor in harbour, but being tossed about hither and thither it leans first to one side and then to the other, and struggles in vain against the waves; so the wicked man, yielding to a perverse and insane disposition, and being unable to regulate his voyage through life without disaster, is constantly tossed about in perpetual expectation of an overturning of his life.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>But the connection of the consequence affects me in no moderate degree; for it happens that that which comes near him who is standing still longs for tranquillity, as being something which resembles itself. Now that which stands still without any deviation is God, and that which is moved is the creature, so that he who comes near to God desires stability; but he who departs from him, as by so doing he is approaching a creature easily overturned, is borne towards that which resembles it.

<p>On this account it is written in the curses contained in <corr>scripture, "Thou</corr> shalt never rest; nor shall there be any rest for the sole of thy foot." <ref n="291.1"/> And, a little afterwards, we read <corr>that, "Thy</corr> life shall hang in doubt before them." <ref n="291.2"/> For it is the nature of the foolish man, who is always being tossed about in a manner contrary to right reason, to be hostile to tranquillity and rest, and not to stand firmly or with a sure

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p>Accordingly he is full of different opinions at different times, and sometimes, even in the same circumstances, without any new occurrence having arisen to affect them, he will be perfectly contrary to <corr>himself, —now</corr> great, now little, now hostile, now friendly; and, in short, he will, so to say, be everything that is most inconsistent in a moment of time. And, as the law-giver says, "All his life shall hang in doubt before him;" having no firm footing, but being constantly tossed about by opposing circumstances, which drag it different ways.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="26">
<p>On which account Moses says, in another <corr>place, "Cursed</corr> of God is he that hangeth on a tree;" <ref n="292.1"/> because what he ought to hang upon is God.
But such a man has, of his own accord, bound himself to the body, which is a wooden burden upon us, exchanging hope for desire and a perfect hope for the greatest of evils; for hope, being the expectation of good things, causes the mind to depend upon the bounteous God; but appetite, creating only unreasonable desires, depends on the body, which nature has made to be a sort of receptacle and abode for the soul.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="27">
<p>Let these men, then, hang by their appetites as by a halter; but the wise Abraham, where he stands, comes near to God, who is also standing. For Moses says <corr>that "Abraham</corr> was standing near to God; and coming nigh unto him, he said," <ref n="292.2"/> <choice><sic>••• For</sic><corr>... For</corr></choice> in good truth the unalterable soul is the <choice><sic>only tiling</sic><corr>only thing</corr></choice> that has access to the unalterable God; and being of such a disposition, it does really stand very near to the Divine power.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="28">
<p>Therefore the oracle which was given to the all-wise Moses most manifestly shows the lasting good condition and stability of the virtuous man. Now, the oracle is as <corr>follows: "And</corr> do thou thyself stand with me." <ref n="292.3"/> By which expression, two things are made clear. One, that it is the living God, who moves and turns about all other beings, being himself unchangeable and immoveable. The second is, that he makes the virtuous man a participator in his own tranquil nature. For, as I suppose, the crooked things are made straight by his straight rule; so, likewise, are the things that are in motion restrained and made stationary by the power of him who always stands still and firm.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="29">
<p>In this passage, therefore, he commands another being to stand with him: but in another place he says, "I will go

<pb n="293"/>
down with thee to Egypt, and I will conduct thee to the end." <ref n="293.1"/> He does not say, Thou shalt go down with me. Why not? Because calmness and stability are the especial attributes of God; but a liability to change one's place, and every kind of motion which has a tendency to change the place, is incident to a created being. When, therefore, he invites the man to his own peculiar good, he says, "Stand thou with me:" <corr>not "I</corr> will stand with thee." <choice><sic>For will</sic><corr>For "will</corr></choice> stand," cannot be said of God, who always stands still.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="30">
<p>But when he comes to that which is the peculiar attribute of the creature, he says, with the most perfect <corr>correctness, "I</corr> will go down with you;" for change of place is adapted to you: so that no one shall go down with me, for in me there is no changing; but whatever is consistent with me, that is to say, with rest, shall stand. And with those who go down in such a manner as to change their place (for change of place is akin to and closely connected with them), I will go down also, not indeed changing my situation as to its actual place, inasmuch as I fill every place with myself.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="31">
<p>And this, too, I do through the pity which exists in rational nature, in order that it may be raised from the hell of the passions to the heavenly region of virtue; I being the guide, who also have made the road which leads to heaven, so that it may be a plain road for suppliant souls, and have shown it to them all, in order that they may not foolishly wander out of the way.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="32">
<p>Having, therefore, now pointed out each variety, the tranquillity of the good man, and the state of agitation in which the bad man lives, let us now consider what follows the statement which we have hitherto been examining. For Moses says that Nod, which name, being interpreted, means the tumult into which the soul has migrated, is opposite to Eden. Now Eden is a symbolical expression for correct and divine reason, on which account its interpretation is luxury; because divine reason is, above all other things, delighted with and exults among unmingled and pure, and also well filled up and complete pleasure, God, the giver of all good things, raising his virgin and undying graces upon it. But by its own intrinsic nature, the bad is always striving with the good, the unjust with the just, the wise with the foolish, and all the different species of virtue with all the different species of vice.
<note n="293.1">Genesis xlvi. 4. </note>
<pb n="294"/>
Something like this is the meaning of the statement that Nod is opposite to Eden.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="33">
<p>After he had said this he proceeds to <corr>say, "And</corr> Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch." <ref n="294.1"/> Is it not here reasonable to raise the question, why Cain knew his wife? for there had been no birth of any one other woman since that of Eve who was formed out of the side of the man, until the woman who is here mentioned;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="34">
<p>and if any one says that Cain took his sister to wife, putting the impiety of such a connection out of the question, he will speak falsely; for Moses represents the daughters of Adam as born late. What then are we to say? As I imagine, Moses here calls his wife opinion of impious reason which it forms about things, as crowds of those who have studied philosophy do: some of them introducing the same opinions into human life, and others introducing such as are wholly at variance with one another.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="35">
<p>What then is the position of the impious man? Why, that the human mind is the measure of all things; which also they say that one of the ancient philosophers, Protagoras, used to employ, being a descendant of the folly of Cain. And from thence I conjecture that his wife, being known to him, brought forth Enoch; and the name Enoch being interpreted means, thy grace.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="36">
<p>For if man is the measure of all things, then, also, all things are a grace and a free gift of the mind; so that we refer to the eye the grace of sight, to the ears that of hearing, and to each of the other external senses their appropriate object, and also to the speech and utterance do we attribute the power of speaking.
And if we judge in this manner of these things, so also do we with respect to intelligence, in which ten thousand things are comprised, such as thoughts, perceptions, designs, meditations, conceptions, sciences, arts, dispositions, and a number of other faculties almost incalculable.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="37">
<p>What is it then that the gravest philosophers, who have talked in the most grandiloquent manner about divine law and the honour due to God, have determined both to say and to allow to be said, If ye have in ye a mind which is equal to God, which regulating by its own power all the good and bad things which exist among men, occasionally mingles both in certain persons, and sometimes
<note n="294.1">Genesis iv. 17. </note>
<pb n="295"/>
distributes both good and bad to some in an unalloyed state;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="38">
<p>and if any one accuses you of impiety, make your defence with a good courage, saying that you have been brought up very admirably by your guide and teacher, Cain, who recommended you to honour the powers that are nearest in preference to that cause which was afar off, to whom you ought to attend for many other reasons, and most especially because he showed the power of his doctrine by very evident works, having conquered Abel the expounder of the opposite doctrine, and having removed and destroyed his doctrine as well as himself.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="39">
<p>But in my opinion and in that of my friends, death in the company of the pious would be preferable to life with the impious; for those who die in the company of the pious everlasting life will receive, but everlasting death will be the <choice><sic>portion -of</sic><corr>portion of</corr></choice> those who live in the other way.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="40">
<p>But as after Cain had begotten Enoch, one of the posterity of Seth is also subsequently called Enoch, it may be well to consider, whether the two namesakes were men of different or of similar dispositions and characters. And at the same time that we examine this question let us also investigate the differences between other persons bearing the same name. For as Enoch was, so also Methusaleh and Lamech were both descendants of Cain, and they were no less the descendants of Seth also.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="41">
<p>We must therefore be aware that each of the aforesaid names, being interpreted, has a double signification; for Enoch, being interpreted, means, as I have already <corr>said, "thy</corr> grace," and Methusaleh means, the sending forth of death. Lamech, again means, humiliation. Now the expression, <choice><sic>"Thy grace,</sic><corr>"Thy grace,"</corr></choice> is by some persons referred to the mind that is in us; and by more learned and sounder interpreters it is referred to the mind of other persons.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="42">
<p>They therefore who say that all thinking, and feeling, and speaking, are the free gifts of their own soul, utter an impious and ungodly opinion, and deserve to be classed among the race of Cain, who, though he was not able to master himself, yet dared to assert that he had absolute possession of all other things; but as for those persons who do not claim all the things in creation as their own, but who ascribe them to the divine grace, being men really noble and sprung out of those who were rich long ago, but of those who love virtue and piety, they may be classed under Seth as the author of their race.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="43">
<p>The race of these men is difficult to trace, since they

<p>Having, therefore, thus distinguished the indications intended to be afforded by the name of Enoch, let us now proceed in regular order to the name of Methuselah; and this name is interpreted, a sending forth of death. Now there are two meanings contained in this word; one, that according to which death is sent <choice><sic>to anyone,</sic><corr>to any one,</corr></choice> and the other, that according to which it is sent away from any one. He, therefore, to whom it is sent, immediately dies, but he, from whom it is sent, lives and survives.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="45">
<p>Accordingly, he who receives death is akin to Cain, who is dying as to the life in accordance with virtue; but he from whom death is sent away and kept at a distance, is most nearly related to Seth, for the good man enjoys real life.</p>

<p>And again, the name Lamech, which means humiliation, is a name of ambiguous meaning; for we are humiliated either when the vigour of our soul is relaxed, according to the diseases and infirmities which arise from the irrational passions, or in respect of our love for virtue, when we seek to restrain ourselves from swelling self-opinions.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="47">
<p>Now the former kind of humiliation arises out of weakness, being a species of that multiform disease of <choice><sic>many changes.</sic><corr>many changes,</corr></choice> <corr>leprosy.

</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="48">
<p>But the second kind of humiliation arises from the strength of perseverance, which is followed by propitiation, according to the perfect number of the decade; for the people are enjoined to humble their souls on the tenth day of the month, and this means to put away all high boasting, the putting away of which works the rejection of all offences, both voluntary and involuntary. Accordingly, the Lamech who is humbled in this sense, is the descendant of Seth, and the father of the just Noah; but he who is humbled in the former manner is the descendant of Cain.

<p>For it is plain that it is not only extraordinary, but utterly contrary to all reason, that one man should build a city. In what manner could he do it? He could not build even the most trifling portion of a house, unless he employed other men as his assistants. Would the same man be able at the same time to cut stones, to cut wood, to work in iron and in brass, and to throw the vast circumference of walls round the city? to build up propylaea, and inter-walls, and temples, and sacred precincts, and porticoes, and docks, and houses, and all the other public and private buildings which one is accustomed to find in a city?

And what is necessary is as follows. When God was dividing and drawing a wall between the nations of the soul, separating those who spoke different languages; and when establishing the sons of the earth in their abodes, he dispersed them and removed to a distance from himself those whom he called the sons of Adam; then he fixed the boundaries of the offspring of virtue, making them equal in number to the angels; for as many angels of God as there are, so many nations and species of virtue are there.
