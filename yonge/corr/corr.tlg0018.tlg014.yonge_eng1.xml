<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/> And the Lord said to <corr>Abraham, "Depart</corr> from thy land, and from thy kindred, and from thy <choice><sic>father's house,</sic><corr>father's house</corr></choice> to a land which I will show thee; and I will make thee into a great nation.

<p>God, wishing to purify the soul of man, first of all gives it an impulse towards complete salvation, namely, a change of abode, so as to quit the three regions of the body, the outward sense and speech according to utterance; for his country is the emblem of the body, and his kindred are the symbol of the outward sense, and his father's house of speech. Why so?</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Because the body derives its composition from the earth, and is again dissolved into earth; and Moses is a witness of this when he says, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." <ref n="43.2"/> For he says, that man was compounded by God fashioning a lump of clay into the form of a man; and it follows of necessity that, a composite being, when dissolved, must be dissolved into its component parts. But the outward sense is nearly connected with and akin to the mind, the irrational part to the rational, since they are both parts of <choice><sic>one soul:</sic><corr>one soul;</corr></choice> but speech is the abode of the father, because our father is the mind, which implants in each of its parts its own powers, and distributes its energies among them, undertaking the care <choice><sic>and superinten dence</sic><corr>and superintendence</corr></choice> of them all; and the abode in which it dwells is speech, a dwelling separated from all the rest of the house; for as the hearth is the abode of a man, so is speech of the mind:

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>at all events, it displays itself, and all the notions which it conceives, arranging them and setting them in order in speech, as if in a house.
And you must not wonder that Moses has called speech in man the abode of the mind, for he also says, that the <choice><sic>mind 01</sic><corr>mind of</corr></choice> the universe, that is to say, God, has for his abode his own word.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>And the practiser of virtue, Jacob, seizing on this apprehension, confesses in express <choice><sic>words that,,.</sic><corr>words that,</corr></choice> <choice><sic>This is</sic><corr>"This is</corr></choice> no other than the house of God," <ref n="44.1"/> an expression equivalent to, The house of God is not this thing, or anything which can be made the subject of ocular demonstration, or, in short, anything which comes under the province of the outward senses, but is invisible, destitute of all specific form, only to be comprehended by the soul as soul.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>What, then, can it be except the Word, which is more ancient than all the things which were the objects of creation, and by means of which it is that the Ruler of the universe, taking hold of it as a rudder, governs all things. And when he was fashioning the world, he used this as <choice><sic>his instru- merit</sic><corr>his instrument</corr></choice> for the blameless arrangement of all the things which he was completing.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>That he means by Abraham's country the body, and by his kindred the outward senses, and by his father's house uttered speech, we have now shown. But the <corr>command, "Depart</corr> <corr>from them,"</corr> is not like or equivalent to, Be separated from them according to your essence, since that would be the injunction of one who was pronouncing sentence of death. But it is the same as saying, Be alienated from them in your mind, allowing none of them to cling to you, standing above them all;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>they are your subjects, use them not as your rulers; since you are a king, learn to govern and not to <choice><sic>be governed</sic><corr>be governed;</corr></choice> know yourself all your life, as Moses teaches us in many passages where he says, "Take heed <corr>to thyself."</corr> <ref n="44.2"/> For thus you will perceive what you ought to be obedient to, and what you ought to be the master of.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Depart therefore from the earthly parts which envelop you, O my friend, fleeing from that base and polluted prison house the body, and from the keepers as it were of the prison, its pleasures and appetites, putting forth all your strength and all your power so as to suffer none of thy good things to come to harm, but improving all your good faculties together and unitedly.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>Depart also from thy kindred, outward senses; for now indeed you have given yourself up to each of them to be made use of as it will, and you have become a good, the property of others who have borrowed you, having lost your own power over yourself. But you know that, even though all men are silent on the subject, your eyes lead you, and so do your ears, and all the rest of the multitude of that kindred connection, towards those objects which are pleasing to themselves.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>But if you choose to collect again those portions of yourself which you have lent away, and to invest yourself with the possession of yourself, without separating off or alienating any part of it, you will have a happy life, enjoying for ever and ever the fruit of good things which belong not to strangers but to yourself.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>But now rise up also and quit speech according to utterance, which Moses here represents God as calling your father's house, that you may not be deceived by the specious beauty of words and names, and so be separated from that real beauty which exists in the things themselves which are intended by these names. For it is absurd for a shadow to be looked upon as of more importance than the bodies themselves, or for an imitation to carry off the palm from the model. Now the interpretation resembles a shadow and an imitation, but the natures of things signified under these expressions, thus interpreted, resemble the bodies and original models which the man who aims at being such and such rather than at appearing so must cling to, removing to a distance from the other things.

<p>When therefore the mind begins to become acquainted with itself, and to dwell among the speculations which come under the province of the intellect, all the inclinations of the soul for the species which is comprehensible by the intellect will be repelled, which inclination is called by the Hebrews, Lot; for which reason the wise man is represented as distinctly <corr>saying, "Depart,</corr> and separate yourself from me;" <ref n="45.1"/> for it is impossible for a man who is overwhelmed with the <choice><sic>love ot</sic><corr>love of</corr></choice> incorporeal and imperishable objects to dwell with one, whose every inclination is towards the mortal objects of the outward senses.

<p>Very beautifully therefore has the sacred interpreter of God's will entitled one entire holy volume of the giving of the

<note n="45.1">Genesis xiii. 9. </note>

law, the Exodus, having thus found out an appropriate name for the oracles contained therein. For being a man desirous of giving instruction and exceedingly ready to admonish and correct, he desires to remove the whole of the people of the soul as a multitude capable of receiving admonition and correction from the country of Egypt, that is to say, the body, and to take them out from among its inhabitants, thinking it a most terrible and grievous burden that the mind which is endowed with the faculty of sight should be oppressed by the pleasures of the flesh, and should obey whatever commands the relentless desires choose to impose upon it.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>Therefore, after the merciful God has instructed this people, groaning and bitterly weeping for the abundance of the things concerning the body, and the exceeding supply of external things (for it is <corr>said, "The</corr> children of Israel groaned by reason of the works") <ref n="46.1"/> when, God, I say, had instructed them about their going out, the prophet himself led them forth in safety.
</p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>But there are some persons who have made a treaty with the body to last till the day of their death, and who have buried themselves in it as in a chest or coffin or whatever else you like to call it, of whom all the parts which are devoted to the slavery of the body and of the passions are consigned to oblivion and buried. But if anything well affected towards virtue has shot up by the side of it, that is preserved in the recollection, by means of which good things are naturally destined to be kept alive.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/></p>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>Accordingly, the sacred scriptures command the bones of Joseph—I mean by this the only parts of such a soul as were left behind, being species which know no corruption and which deserve to have mention made <corr>of them—to</corr> be preserved, thinking it preposterous for pure things not to be united to pure things.</p>

<p>And what is especially worthy of being mentioned is this, that he believed that God would visit the race which was capable of seeing," <ref n="46.2"/> and would not give it up for ever and ever to ignorance, that blind mistress, but would distinguish between the immortal and the mortal parts of the soul, and leave in Egypt those parts which were conversant about the pleasures of the body and the other immoderate indulgences of the passions; but with respect to those parts which

</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>What then are the parts which are imperishable? In the first place, a perfect alienation from pleasure which says, "Let us lie down together," <ref n="47.1"/> and let us enjoy human enjoyments; secondly, presence of mind combined with fortitude, by means of which the soul separates and distinguishes from one another those things which by vain opinions are accounted good things, as so many dreams, confessing <corr>that "the</corr> only true and accurate explanations of things are to be found <corr>with God;"</corr> <ref n="47.2"/> and that all those imaginings, which exist in the unsteady, puffed up, and arrogant life of those men who are not yet purified, but who delight in those pleasures which proceed from bakers, and cooks, and wine-bearers, are uncertain and indistinct;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>so that such a man is not a subject but a ruler of Egypt, that is to say of the whole region of the body; so <corr>that "he</corr> boasted of being of the race of the Hebrews," <ref n="47.3"/> who were accustomed to rise up and leave the objects of the outward senses, and to go over to those of the intellect; for the name Hebrew, being interpreted, <corr>means "one</corr> who <corr>passes over,"</corr> because he boasted <corr>that "here</corr> he had <choice><sic>done nothing.˙'</sic><corr>done nothing."</corr></choice> <ref n="47.4"/>
For to do nothing of those things which are thought much of among the wicked, but to hate them all and reject them, is praiseworthy in no slight degree;</p>

<p>as it is to despise immoderate indulgence of the desires and all other passions; to fear God, if a man is not yet capable of loving him, and even while in Egypt to have a desire for real life.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="23">
<p>but there are many other things also resembling these, being of a superior and more sacred kind of order; and they do not endure to abide in Egypt, the house of the body, and are never buried in a coffin at all, but depart to a distance outside of every thing mortal, and follow the words of the lawgiver, namely, Moses, who is the guide of their path.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="24">
<p>For Moses, being the nurse as it were and tutor of good works, and good expressions, and good intentions, which, even if at times they are mingled with those of an opposite character by reason of the somewhat confused medely which exists in mortal man; are nevertheless distinguished when they have passed, so that all the seeds and plants of excellence may not be destroyed and perish for ever and ever.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="25">
<p>And he exhorts men very vigorously to quit that which is called the mother of every thing that is absurd, without any delay or sluggishness, but rather using exceeding swiftness; for he says that <corr>men "must</corr> sacrifice the pascha, in haste," <ref n="48.2"/> and the word pascha, being interpreted, means <corr>a "passing</corr> over," in order that the mind, exerting its reasonings without any doubt, and also an energetic willingness and promptness, may, without ever turning back make a passing over from the passions, to gratitude to God the Saviour, who has led it forth beyond all its expectations to freedom.

<p>And why do we wonder if he exhorts the man who is led away by the force of unreasonable passions, neither to yield, nor to allow himself to be carried away by the impetuosity of its onward course, but to exert all his strength, to resist, and if he is unable to resist effectually, then to flee. For the second advance towards safety on the part of those who are unable to make a good resistance is flight. When the occasion does not permit the man who is a combatant by nature, and who has never been a slave of the passions, but who is always undergoing the toil of resistance to every separate one of them, to put forth all his powers of antagonism at all times, lest from the continuance of his struggles against them he may gradually contract a painful infection from them; for there
