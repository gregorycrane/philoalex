<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="1">
<p>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>"And he also added, that she should bring forth his brother." <ref n="207.1"/> The addition of one thing is a taking away of some other; as for instance, of particles in arithmetic, and of reasons in the soul. If then we must say that Abel is added, we must also think that Cain is taken away. But that the unusual character of expression may not cause perplexity to many we will endeavour to explain accurately the philosophy which is apparent beneath them, as clearly as may be in our power.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="2">
<p>It happens then, that there are two opinions contrary to and at variance with one another; the one of which commits everything to the mind as the leader of all reasoning, or feeling, or moving, or being stationary; and the other, attributing to God all the consequent work of creation as his own. Now the symbol of the former of these is Cain, which name, being interpreted <corr>means, "possession,"</corr> from his appearing to possess all things; and the symbol of the other is Abel; for this name, being interpreted, <corr>means "referring</corr> to God."</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="3">
<p>Now both these opinions were brought forth by one soul. But it follows of necessity that as soon as they were born they must have been separated; for it was impossible for enemies to dwell together for ever. Until then the soul brought forth <choice><sic>the God- loving</sic><corr>the God-loving</corr></choice> doctrine Abel, the self-loving Cain dwelt with her. But when she brought forth Abel, or unanimity with God, she abandoned unanimity with that mind which was wise in its own conceit.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="4">
<p>And this will be more evidently shown by the oracle which was given to Perseverance, that is to Rebecca; <ref n="207.2"/> for she also, having conceived the two inconsistent natures of good and evil, and having considered each of them very deeply
<note n="207.1">Genesis iv. 2. </note>
<note n="207.2">Genesis xxv. 24. </note>
<pb n="208"/>
according to the injunctions of prudence, beholding them both exulting, and making a sort of skirmish as a prelude to the war which was to exist between them; she, I say, besought God to explain to her what this calamity meant, and what was the remedy for it. And he answered her inquiry, and told <corr>her, "Two</corr> nations are in thy womb." This calamity is the birth of good and <corr>evil. "But</corr> two peoples shall be divided in thy bowels." And the remedy is, for these two to be parted and separated from one another, and no longer to abide in the same place.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="5">
<p>God therefore having added the good doctrine, that is Abel, to the soul, took away from it evil doctrine, that is Cain: for Abraham also, leaving mortal <corr>things, "is</corr> added to the people of God," <ref n="208.1"/> having received immortality, and having become equal to the angels; for the angels are the host of God, being incorporeal and happy souls. And in the same manner Jacob, the practiser of virtue, is added to the better one, <ref n="208.2"/> because he had quitted the worse.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="6">
<p>And Isaac, who was thought worthy of self-taught knowledge, of his own accord also leaves all the corporeal essence which was attached to his soul, and is added to and made an inheritor with (not the people, as the others whom I have mentioned were), but with the "race," <ref n="208.3"/> as Moses says; for "race" is one, and the highest of all: <corr>but "people,"</corr> is the name of many.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="7">
<p>As many, therefore, as through instruction and learning have improved and at last arrived at perfection, are classed among the larger number. Nor is number insignificant of those who have learnt from oral instruction and demonstration, and whom Moses calls the people. But those men who have forsaken human instruction, and having become well-disposed disciples of God, and having arrived at a comprehension of knowledge acquired without labour, have passed over to the immortal and most perfect race of beings, and have so received an inheritance better than the former generations of created men; and of these men Isaac is reckoned as a companion.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="8">
<p>There is also another proof that the mind is immortal, which is of <corr>this nature:—There</corr> are some persons whom God, advancing to higher degrees of improvement, has enabled to soar above all species and genera, having placed them near himself; as he says to Moses, "But stand thou here with
<note n="208.1">Genesis xxv. 8. </note>
<note n="208.2">Genesis xlix. 33. </note>
<note n="208.3">Genesis xxxv. 25. </note>
<pb n="209"/>
me." <ref n="209.1"/> When, therefore, Moses is about to die, he is not added to one class, nor does he forsake another, as the men before him had done; nor is he connected with "addition" <corr>or "subtraction,"</corr> <corr>but "by</corr> means of the word of the Cause of all things, by whom the whole world was made." <ref n="209.2"/> He departs to another abode, that you may understand from this that God accounts a wise man as entitled to equal honour with the world itself, having both created the universe, and raised the perfect man from the things of earth up to himself by the same word.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="9">
<p>Not but what, when he gave him the use of all earthly things and suffered him to dwell among them, he assigned to him not such a power as he might exercise in common with an earthly governor or monarch, by which he should forcibly rule over the passions of the soul, but he appointed him to be a sort of god, making the whole of the body, and the mind, which is the ruler of the body, subjects and slaves to <corr>him; "For</corr> I give thee," says he, "as a god to Pharaoh." <ref n="209.3"/> But God is not susceptible of any subtraction or addition, inasmuch as he is complete and entirely equal to himself.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="10">
<p>In reference to which it is said of <corr>Moses, "That</corr> no one is said to know of his tomb;" <ref n="209.4"/> for who could be competent to perceive the migration of a perfect soul to the living God? Nor do I even believe that the soul itself while awaiting this event was conscious of its own improvement, inasmuch as it was at that time becoming gradually divine; for God, in the case of those persons whom he is about to benefit, does not take him who is to receive the advantage into his counsels, but is accustomed rather to pour his benefits ungrudgingly upon him without his having any previous anticipation of them.
This is something like the meaning of God's adding the creation of what is good to the perfect mind. But the good is holiness, the name of which is Abel.

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="11">
<p>"And Abel became a shepherd of sheep; but Cain was a tiller of the ground." Why now has Moses, who represents Cain as older than Abel, now transposed them in the order in which he here mentions them, so as to name the younger first when relating their choice of a way of life? For it was natural that the elder should lead the way and adopt <choice><sic>the vation</sic><corr>the cultivation</corr></choice>

 of the land, and that the younger should subsequently come to the care of sheep.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="12">
<p>But Moses is not influenced by what is likely and probable, but pursues the plain unadulterated truth. And when he alone comes to God by himself, he tells him with all freedom that "he is not eloquent," which statement is equivalent to saying that he does not aim at specious and plausible reasonings, and that this has happened to <corr>him "not</corr> yesterday, or the day before yesterday, but ever since God began to converse with him as his servant." <ref n="210.1"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="13">
<p>For they who have come into the billows and heavy waves of life must be borne on by swimming, not being able to take hold of any firm point of the matters which lie within the province of knowledge, but depending on what is only likely and probable. But it becomes a servant of God to lay hold of the truth, disregarding and rejecting all the uncertain and fabulous statements which rest on the conjectures of plausible men.
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="14">
<p>What, then, is the truth in these matters which we are considering? Why, that wickedness is older than virtue in point of time, but younger in power and rank. Therefore, when the birth of the two is narrated, let Cain have the precedence; but when a comparison of their pursuits is instituted, then let Abel be the first;</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="15">
<p>for it happens to the being that is born, from his very swaddling clothes till the time when the innovating vigour of his ripe age extinguishes the fiery heat of his passions, to have for his foster brethren, folly, intemperance, injustice, fear, cowardice, and the other evil things which are born with him, every one of which his nurses and tutors foster and cause to grow up within him; by their habits and practises banishing piety, and by their uniform instructions introducing superstition, which is a thing nearly akin to impiety.</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="16">
<p>But when the child has now passed the age of youth, and when the impetuous disease of the passions has become mollified, as if a calm had come over them, then the man begins to enjoy tranquillity, having been at length and not without difficulty strengthened in the foundation of virtue, which has allayed that continued and incessant agitation which is the greatest evil of the soul.
Thus wickedness has the superiority in point of time; but virtue in point of rank, and honour and real glory. And this same law-giver is a trustworthy evidence of this fact;
<note n="210.1">Exodus iv. 10. </note>
<pb n="211"/>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="17">
<p>for having introduced Esau, who bears the name of folly, as the elder in point of time, he gives the birthright and chief honour to the younger, who, from his practise of virtue, was called Jacob. And he is not seen to obtain this pre-eminence before (as is the case in athletic contests) his adversary renounces the combat, putting down his hands from weakness, and yielding up the decision and the crown to him who has carried on a truceless and irreconcileable war against the passions; for, says Moses, "He sold his birthright to Jacob," <ref n="211.1"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="18">
<p>avowing, in plain terms that the pre-eminence in power and the honours of virtue belong to no wicked man, but only to him who is a lover of wisdom, just as the flute and the lyre and the other instruments of music belong to the musician alone.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/></p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="19">
<p>And concerning this doctrine Moses also records a law, which he makes with great beauty and suitableness. And it runs <corr>thus, "If</corr> a man have two wives, the one of them beloved and the other hated; and if both the one who is beloved and the one who is hated have borne him children, and if the child of her who is hated is the first-born, then it shall be in the day in which he divides the inheritance of his possessions among his sons that he shall not be able to give the inheritance of the first-born to the son of the wife that is beloved, overlooking his first-born son, the son of her who is hated; but he shall recognise <choice><sic>the soil</sic><corr>the son</corr></choice> of her who is hated as his first-born, to give him a double share of all the property that he has acquired; because he is the beginning of his children, and the right of the first-born is his." <ref n="211.2"/>
</p>
</div>

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="20">
<p>Consider, O my soul, and know who it is who is hated, and who is the son of her who is hated, and immediately you shall perceive that the chief rights and chief honours belong to no one else but to him alone; for there are two wives cohabiting with each individual of us, hostile and inimical to one another, filling the abode of the soul with the contentions which arise from jealousy. Of these we love one, which is gentle and tractable, and which we think very affectionate and akin to ourselves, and its name is pleasure; but the other we hate, looking upon it as untameable, ungentle, fierce, and very hostile to us, and the name of this one is virtue. Now what mortal is ignorant of the great mysteries of that exceedingly beautiful and greatly contended for pleasure? And who could worthily
<note n="211.1"> Genesis xxv. 33. </note>
<note n="211.2">Deuteronomy xxi. 15. </note>

describe the multitude or the greatness of the good things which are treasured up by virtue?

<div type="textpart" subtype="section" n="21">
<p>For two women live with each individual among us,
both unfriendly and hostile to one another, filling the whole
abode of the soul with envy, and jealousy, and contention;
of these we love the one looking upon her as being mild and
tractable, and very dear to and very closely connected with
ourselves, and she is called pleasure; but the other we detest,
deeming her unmanageable, savage, fierce, and most
completely hostile, and her name is virtue. Accordingly, the one
comes to us luxuriously dressed in the guise of a harlot and
prostitute, with mincing steps, rolling her eyes about with
excessive licentiousness and desire, by which baits she
entraps the souls of the young, looking about with a mixture
of boldness and impudence, holding up her head, and raising
herself above her natural height, fawning and giggling, having
the hair of her head dressed with most superfluous
elaborateness, having her eyes pencilled, her eyebrows covered over,
using incessant warm baths, painted with a fictitious colour,
exquisitely dressed with costly garments, richly embroidered,
adorned with armlets, and bracelets, and necklaces, and all
other ornaments which can be made of gold, and precious
stones, and all kinds of female decorations; loosely girdled,
breathing of most fragrant perfumes, thinking the whole
market her home; a marvel to be seen in the public roads,
out of the scarcity of any genuine beauty, pursuing a bastard
elegance.

<p>And with her there walk as her most intimate friends, bold
cunning, and rashness, and flattery, and trick, and deceit,
and false speaking, and false opinion, and impiety, and
injustice, and intemperance, in the middle of which she
advances like the leader of the company, and marshalling her
band, speaks thus to her <corr>mind, "My</corr> good friend, the treasuries
of all human blessings and stores of happiness are in my
power (for as for divine blessings they are all in heaven), and
besides them you will find nothing.

either domestic or foreign, has ever cut down these plants, but
from the very day that the earth first received them it has
cherished them like a faithful nurse, sending down into its
lowest depths <choice><sic>the routs</sic><corr>the roots</corr></choice> to act like the strongest branches, and

<p>When the other woman heard these words (for she was
standing in a place where she was out of sight but still within
hearing), fearing lest the mind, without being aware of it,
might be led captive and be enslaved, and so be carried away
by so many gifts and promises, yielding also to the tempter in
that she was arrayed so as to win over the sight, and was
equipped with great variety of ingenuity for the purposes of
deceit; for by all her necklaces and other appendages, and by
her different allurements, she spurred on and charmed her
beholders, and excited a wonderful desire within them; she in
her turn came forward, and appeared on a sudden, displaying
all the qualities of a native, free-born, and lady-like woman,
such as a firm step, a very gentle look, the native colour of
modesty and nature without any alloy or disguise, an honest
disposition, a genuine and sincere way of life, a plain, honest
opinion, a language removed from all insincerity, the truest
possible image of a sound and honest heart, a disposition
averse to pretence, a quiet unobtrusive gait, a moderate style
of dress, and the ornaments of prudence and virtue, more precious than any gold.

and good-temper, and modesty, and an absence of curiosity
about the concerns of others, and manly courage, and a noble
disposition and wisdom in counsel, and prudence, and
forethought, and attention, and correctness, and cheerfulness, and
humanity, and gentleness, and courtesy, and love of one's
kind, and magnanimity, and happiness, and goodness. One

her, began to speak as follows: "I have seen pleasure, that
worker of wondrous tricks, that conjuror and teller of fables,

you in a delicate manner; so that (for I myself do by nature

very greatest of evils as if they were exceeding good; and

what really belongs to that woman, in order that you might
not reject anything advantageous to you out of ignorance, and
so proceed unintentionally on the road of transgression and
unhappiness.

<p>"Know, then, that the very dress in which she appear
to you wholly belongs to some one else; for of ten things
which contribute to genuine beauty, not one is ever brought
forward as being derived from or as belonging to her. But she
is hung round with nets and snares with which to catch you
with a bastard and adulterated beauty, which you, beholding
beforehand, will, if you are wise, take care that her pursuit
shall be unprofitable to her; for when she appears she
conciliates your eyes, and when she speaks she wins over your
ears; and by these, and by all other parts of her conduct, she
is well calculated by nature to injure your soul, which is the
most valuable of all <choice><sic>your possessions,</sic><corr>your possessions;</corr></choice> and all the different
circumstances belonging to her, which were likely to be
attractive to you if you heard of them, she enumerated; but all
those which would not have been alluring she suppressed and
made no mention of, but, meaning mischief to you, concealed
utterly, as she very naturally expected that no one would
readily agree with them."

harshness in it; but, on the contrary, I will say nothing about
those matters which do of themselves give delight and pleasure,

by their effects; but I will fully detail to you all <choice><sic>that iy</sic><corr>that is</corr></choice> painful
and difficult to be borne about me, putting them plainly forward
with their naked appellation, so that their nature may be visible
and plain even to those whose sight is somewhat dim. For
the things which, when offered by me, appear to be the greatest
of my evils, will in effect be found to be more honourable and
more beneficial to the users than the greatest blessings
bestowed by pleasure. But, before I begin to speak of what I

But labour is the enemy of laziness, as it is in reality the first and greatest of good things, and wages an irreconcileable war against pleasure; for, if we must declare the truth, God has made labour the foundation of all good and of all virtue to man, and without labour you will not find a single good thing in existence among the race of men.</p>

<p>Reason which fled to God and became his suppliant, is what is here called the Levite; God having taken this from the most central and dominant part of the soul, that is to say, having taken it to himself and appropriated it as his own share, thought it worthy of the honour due to the first-born. So that from these it is plain that Reuben is the first-born of Jacob, but

As therefore Jacob is found to be the inheritor of the birth-right of Esau, eagerness in wickedness having been defeated by virtuous labour, so also Levi, as one who devotes himself to perfect virtue, will carry off the honours of seniority from Reuben, the man of a good disposition. But the most undeniable proof of perfection is for a man to be a fugitive to God, having abandoned all concern for the things of creation.

Namely that every wise man is a ransom for a worthless one, who would not be able to last for even a short time, if the wise man by the exertion of mercy and prudence did not take thought for his lasting; as a physician opposing himself to the infirmities of an invalid, and either rendering them slighter, or altogether removing them unless the disease comes on with irresistible violence, and surmounts all the ingenuity of medical skill.</p>

First of all, therefore, we must repeat what is consistent with what has been already said, that the good man is the ransom of the worthless one, so that they who have sinned will naturally come to those who have been hallowed, for the sake of being purified; and, in the second place, we must consider that the Levites admit the fugitives because they themselves are potentially fugitives;</p>
