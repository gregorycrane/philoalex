<div n="1" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section1"><s id="section1sent1">As to the preceding topics, what has been already said will be sufficient.</s><s id="section1sent2">We must next proceed to consider, and that in no slight or cursory manner, the philosophical account which Moses gives us of the confusion of languages; for he speaks in the following manner: "And all the earth had one pronunciation, and there was one language among all men.</s><s id="section1sent3">And it came to pass, as they were moving from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt there.</s><s id="section1sent4">And one man said to his neighbour, Come, let us make bricks, and let us burn them with fire; and they had bricks for stone, and asphalt for mortar.</s><s id="section1sent5">And they said, Come, let us build ourselves a city, and a tower whose head shall reach to heaven; and let us make for ourselves a name, before we are scattered over the face of all the earth.</s><s id="section1sent6">And the Lord came down to see the city, and the tower, which the sons of men had builded.</s><s id="section1sent7">And the Lord said, Behold, all mankind is one race, and there is but one language among them all; and they have begun to do this thing, and now there will not fail unto them anything of all the things which they desire to do.</s><s id="section1sent8">Come, let us go down and confuse their language there, so that each may not understand the voice of his neighbour.</s><s id="section1sent9">And the Lord scattered them from thence over the face of all the earth, and they desisted from building the city, and the tower.</s><s id="section1sent10">On this account, the name of it was called Confusion, because there the Lord confused the languages of all the earth, and from thence the Lord scattered them over the face of all the earth."</s></p>
</div>
<div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section2"><s id="section2sent1">Those who are discontented at the constitution under which their fathers have lived, being always eager to blame and to accuse the laws, being impious men, use these and similar instances as foundations for their impiety, saying, "Are ye even</s><s id="section2sent2">now speaking boastfully concerning your precepts, as if they contained the rules of truth itself?</s><s id="section2sent3">For, behold, the books which you call the sacred scriptures do also contain fables, at which you are accustomed to laugh, when you hear others relating them."</s></p>
</div>
<div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section3"><s id="section3sent1">And what is the use of devoting our leisure to collecting the fables interspersed in so many places throughout the history of the giving of the law, as if we had especial leisure for the consideration of calumnies, and as if it were not better to attend merely to what is under our hands and before us?</s></p>
</div>
<div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section4"><s id="section4sent1">Certainly, this one fable resembles that which is composed about the Aloadae, who the greatest and most glorious of all poets, Homer, says, had in contemplation to heap the three loftiest mountains on one another, and to build them into one mass, hoping that by this means there would be a road for them, as they were desirous to mount up to heaven, and that by these mountains it would be easy for them to be raised to the height of the sky.</s><s id="section4sent2">And the verses of Homer on this subject are these:—</s><s id="section4sent3">High on Olympus' top they strove to raise 
Gigantic Ossa; and on Ossa's heights</s><s id="section4sent4">To place the leafy Pelion, that heaven 
Might thus become accessible.</s><s id="section4sent5">But Olympus and Ossa and Pelion are the names of mountains.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section5"><s id="section5sent1">But instead of these mountains the lawgiver represents a tower as having been built by these men, who, out of ignorance and wicked ambition, were desirous to reach the heaven.</s><s id="section5sent2">Every alienation of mind, then, is grievous; for even if every portion of the whole earth could be built over, a slight foundation being first laid, and then if a superstructure could be raised in the fashion of a single pillar, it would still be an enormous distance removed from the heavenly sphere, and above all would it be so according to the tenets of those curious philosophers who have affirmed that the earth is the centre of the universe.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section6"><s id="section6sent1">And there is also another story akin to this, related by the devisers of fables, concerning the sameness of language existing among animals: for they say that formerly, all the animals in the world, whether land animals, or aquatic ones, or winged ones, had but one language, and that, just as among men Greeks speak the same language as Greeks, and the present race of barbarians speak the same language as</s><s id="section6sent2">barbarians, exactly in the same manner every animal was able to converse with every other animal with which it might meet, and with which it did anything, or from which it suffered anything, so that they sympathised with one another at their mutual misfortunes, and rejoiced whenever any of them met with any good fortune;</s></p>
</div>
<div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section7"><s id="section7sent1">for they could impart their pleasures and their annoyances to one another by their sameness of language, so that they felt pleasure together and pain together; and this similarity of manners and union of feelings lasted, until being sated with the great abundance of good things which they enjoyed, as often happens, they were at last drawn on to a desire of what was unattainable, and even sent an embassy to treat for immortality, requesting to be released from old age, and to be always endowed with the vigour of youth, saying, that already one animal of their body, and that a reptile, the serpent, had received this gift; for he, having put off old age, was allowed again to grow young; and that it was absurd for the more important animals to be left behind by an inferior one, or for their whole body to be distanced by one.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section8"><s id="section8sent1">However, they suffered the punishment suitable to their audacity, for they immediately were separated in their language, so that, from that time forth, they have not been able to understand one another, by reason of the difference in the dialects into which the one common language of them all had been divided.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section9"><s id="section9sent1">But he who brings his account nearer the truth, has distinguished between the rational and irrational animals, so that he testifies that identity of language belonged to men alone: and this also, as they say, is a fabulous story.</s><s id="section9sent2">And indeed they affirm, that the separation of language into an infinite variety of dialects, which Moses calls the confusion of tongues, was effected as a remedy for sins, in order that men might not be able to co-operate in common for deeds of wickedness through understanding one another; and that they might not, when they were in a manner deprived of all means of communication with one another, be able with united energies to apply themselves to the same actions.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section10"><s id="section10sent1">But this precaution does not appear to have turned out of any use; for since that time, though men have been separated into different nations, and have no longer used one language, nevertheless, land and sea have been repeatedly filled with unspeakable evils.</s><s id="section10sent2">For it was not the languages which were the causes of men's uniting for evil objects, but the emulation and rivalry of their souls in wrong-doing.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section11"><s id="section11sent1">For even those who have had their tongues cut out can intimate what they wish by nods and looks, and other positions and motions of the body, not less than by a distinct utterance of words.</s><s id="section11sent2">And besides this consideration, there is the fact that, very often, one nation by itself, having not merely one language, but one code of laws, and one system of manners, has arrived at such a pitch of iniquity that, as to a superfluity of wickedness, it may counterbalance the sins of all the men in the world put together.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section12"><s id="section12sent1">And again, through ignorance of foreign languages, many persons, having no foreknowledge of the future, have been anticipated and overwhelmed by those who were plotting against them; as, on the other hand, by knowledge of foreign languages, men have been able to repel fears and dangers with which they have been threatened; so that a community of language is an advantageous thing rather than an injurious one: since, even at the present day, nothing contributes so greatly to the safety and protection of the people of each country, and particularly of the natives, as their being of one language.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="13" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section13"><s id="section13sent1">For if a man has learnt many dialects, he immediately is looked upon with consideration and respect by those who are also acquainted with them, as being already a friendly person, and contributing no small introduction and means of friendship by reason of his familiarity with words which they too understand; which familiarity very commonly imparts a feeling of security, that one is not likely to suffer any great evil at the hands of such a man.</s><s id="section13sent2">Why, then, did God remove sameness of language from among men as a cause of evils, when it seems it should rather have been established as a most useful thing?</s></p>
</div>
<div n="14" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section14"><s id="section14sent1">Those, then, who put these things together, and cavil at them, and raise malicious objections, will be easily refuted separately by those who can produce ready solutions of all such questions as arise from the plain words of the law, arguing in a spirit far from contentious, and not encountering them by sophisms drawn from any other source, but following the connection of natural consequences, which does not permit them to stumble, but which easily puts aside any impediments that arise, so that the course of their arguments proceeds without any interruption or mishap.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="15" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section15"><s id="section15sent1">We say then that by the expression, that "all the earth had but one pronunciation and one language," is intimated a symphony of great and unspeakable evils, which cities have inflicted upon cities, nations upon nations, and countries upon countries, and through which men not only wrong one another, but also behave with impiety towards God, and yet these things are the iniquities of many; but let us consider the ineffable multitude of evils which proceed from each individual man, and especially when he is under the influence of that ill-timed, and inharmonious, and unmusical agreement.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="16" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section16"><s id="section16sent1">Now who is there who does not know the great influence of fortune, when men, in addition to the diseases or mutilations of the body, are attacked also by poverty and want of reputation?</s><s id="section16sent2">And again, when these things are further united to diseases of the soul, in consequence of moody melancholy, driving men beside themselves, or of extreme old age, or of any other severe calamity which presses upon them?</s></p>
</div>
<div n="17" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section17"><s id="section17sent1">For even one of these evils here mentioned by itself, when it opposes a man with violence, is sufficient to overthrow and to crush even one who is very proud and haughty; but when all these evils, to wit, the evils of the body, and the evils of the soul, and external misfortunes, all come together as if in one regular battalion, moving by previous arrangement at the same time, so as to attack him in one body, what resolution is there which they will not overpower?</s><s id="section17sent2">For when the guards are slain, it follows of necessity that he who relies on his guards must fall.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="18" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section18"><s id="section18sent1">Now the guards of the body are wealth, glory, and honours, which set it up and raise it on high, and make it proud, just as the contrary things, dishonour, want of reputation, and poverty, throw it down like so many enemies.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="19" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section19"><s id="section19sent1">Again, the body-guards of the soul are hearing, and seeing, and smelling, and taste, and the whole band of the outward senses, and also health, and strength, and vigour, and energy.</s><s id="section19sent2">For the mind, when walking among and living in the company of these things, as between well-fortified boundaries firmly standing and solidly established, triumphs and rejoices, meeting with no hindrance on any side to prevent it from exerting its own impulses, but having its road in every direction easy, and level, and open, and easy to be travelled.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="20" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section20"><s id="section20sent1">But the things which are set in opposition and hostility to these</s><s id="section20sent2">guards are mutilation of the organs of the outward senses, and disease, as I have said before, by which the mind is often precipitated into disaster; and these things are all the results of fortune, very grievous and intrinsically miserable, but still, if compared with those which are brought on ourselves by our own deliberate will, they are far lighter.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="21" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section21"><s id="section21sent1">Let us now again in its turn consider what is the united body of evils voluntarily incurred.</s><s id="section21sent2">Our soul being capable of being divided into three divisions, one division is said to have fallen to the lot of the mind and of reason, the second to passion, and the third to appetite; and each separate one of these has its own peculiar evils, and also they have all common and mutual diseases.</s><s id="section21sent3">Since the mind reaps the harvest which folly, and cowardice, and intemperance, and injustice sow; and passion brings forth frantic and insane strife and conflict, and all the other numerous evils with which it is pregnant; and appetite disseminates in every direction the impetuous and fickle loves of youth which descend upon every object, animate or inanimate, which it chances to meet with.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="22" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section22"><s id="section22sent1">For then, as if in any vessel, the sailors, and the passengers, and the pilots, had all, under the influence of insanity, agreed to destroy it, those who have joined in the plot against it are none the less involved in the same destruction.</s><s id="section22sent2">For the heaviest of all evils, and almost the only one that is incurable, is the unanimous energy of all the parts of the soul agreeing to commit sin, not one of the parts being able to act with soundness (just as is the case in an evil affecting the whole people), so as to heal those that are sick; but even the physicians being diseased as well as their patients, whom the pestilential disease has overwhelmed and weighs down under a confessed calamity.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="23" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section23"><s id="section23sent1">Of this great evil, that great deluge described by the lawgiver is an image; for the torrents from heaven continually pouring down cataracts of wickedness itself with impetuous violence, and springs from the ground (by which I mean the body) continually bursting up and pouring forth streams of every passion in great numbers and vast size, which, uniting and being mingled in the same stream with the other waters, are thrown into confusion, and overthrow the whole region of the soul which has received them with incessant eddies and whirlpools.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="24" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section24"><s id="section24sent1">"For," says Moses, "the Lord God,</s><s id="section24sent2">seeing that the wickedness of men were multiplied upon the earth, and that every one did think continually in his heart nothing but evil all his days, determined to punish man" (and here by man I understand the mind, together with all the reptiles and winged creatures, and all the rest of the multitude of wild animals which surround him), by reason of his incurable wickedness; and the punishment which God decided upon was the deluge.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="25" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section25"><s id="section25sent1">For there was unbounded freedom in sinning, and unlimited licence in doing wrong, no one hindering it, but all restraints being shamelessly broken down in such a way that there was no fear left behind to restrain those who were thoroughly ready to snatch at abundant supplies for enjoyment of every kind.</s><s id="section25sent2">And may we not say that this was natural?</s><s id="section25sent3">For it was not only one portion of the soul which was corrupted in such a way that it could still be preserved by the sound condition of the other parts; but there was no part whatever of it which was left free from disease or from corruption.</s><s id="section25sent4">For the incorruptible Judge, says Moses, seeing that every thought of man's heart (not one single idea by itself) was evil continually, inflicted upon him a deserved punishment.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="26" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section26"><s id="section26sent1">These are they who "made a treaty with one another in the valley of Salt."</s><s id="section26sent2">For the region of the vices and of the passions is a hollow valley, rough, and full of ravines; truly salt, and producing bitter pains; and their treaty, as one that was not worthy of being confirmed by any oath or by any libation, the wise Abraham, who knew the character of it, annulled.</s><s id="section26sent3">For it is said in the scripture that, "All these men made a treaty at the valley of Salt, that is the sea of Salt."</s></p>
</div>
<div n="27" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section27"><s id="section27sent1">Do you not perceive that they who are barren of wisdom and blinded as to the intellect which it would be natural to expect should be sharp-sighted, having the name of Sodomites from their real character," did, with all their people united together, from young to old, surround the house in a circle"  (that is to say, the house of the soul), in order to pollute and contaminate those strangers from a foreign land, who had been received in hospitality, namely, sacred and holy reasons, the guards and defenders of the soul; no one whatever attempting either to resist those wrong doers, or to avoid doing wrong himself?</s></p>
</div>
<div n="28" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section28"><s id="section28sent1">For Moses does not speak of some as having consented and of others having stood aloof; but, as he says, "The whole</s><s id="section28sent2">people surrounded the house all together, both old and young," having entered into a conspiracy against all those holy actions and words which it is customary to call angels.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="29" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section29"><s id="section29sent1">But Moses, the prophet of God, will meet them and check them, though they come on with exceeding boldness; even though, placing in the front him who is the boldest and the most forward and able speaker among them as their king, namely speech, they rush on with one impulse, hoping to increase their strength as they go on, and overflowing like a river; "For behold," says Moses, "the king of Egypt is coming to the water; but do thou go to meet him, and stand on the bank of the river."</s></p>
</div>
<div n="30" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section30"><s id="section30sent1">Therefore the wicked man goes forth to the stream of iniquities and passions, and all collected evils, which are here likened to water; but the wise man first obtains from God, who always stands firm, an honour akin to his undeviating, and in all respects and under all circumstances, unchangeable power; for we read in the scripture.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="31" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section31"><s id="section31sent1">"But do thou stand here with me, "  that having laid aside doubt and vacillation, the dispositions of an infirm soul, he may put on that most steadfast and trustworthy disposition, faith.</s><s id="section31sent2">In the next place, even while standing still, he (which seems a most extraordinary thing) goes forward to meet him; for it is said to him, "Thou shalt stand meeting him," and yet to go to meet is a part of motion, while to stand still is regarded as characteristic of tranquillity.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="32" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section32"><s id="section32sent1">But the prophet does not here say things which are inconsistent, but rather such as are exceedingly in accordance with nature; for the man whose mind is naturally disposed to be tranquil, and is established undeviatingly, must necessarily be at variance with all those who delight in disorder and confusion, and who by artificial storms seek to disturb him who is capable of enjoying tranquillity.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="33" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section33"><s id="section33sent1">It is very appropriately said that the meeting took place on the bank of the river; but the banks are also called the lips, and the lips are the boundaries of the mouth, and are a sort of fence to the tongue, through which the stream of discourse is borne, when it begins to be uttered;</s></p>
</div>
<div n="34" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section34"><s id="section34sent1">but those who hate virtue and who love learning, use speech as their ally for the exposition of doctrines which are disapproved; and again, on the other hand, virtuous men employ it for the</s><s id="section34sent2">refutation of such doctrines, and for establishing the irresistible strength of the better and true wisdom.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="35" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section35"><s id="section35sent1">When then, after having had recourse to every expedient of contentious doctrines, men are destroyed, being overwhelmed by the opposing violence of contrary arguments, then the wise man will very justly and suitably establish a most sacred chorus, and melodiously sing a triumphal song;</s></p>
</div>
<div n="36" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section36"><s id="section36sent1">"For," says Moses, "Israel saw the Egyptians," not dead in any other place, but "on the bank (χε̃ιλος) of the river;"  meaning here by death, not the separation of the soul from the body, but the impetuous onset of unholy doctrines and assertions, which men utter by the mouth, and tongue, and the other organs of speech.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="37" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section37"><s id="section37sent1">But the death of speech is silence, not that silence which well-bred people cultivate, making it a symbol of modesty—for this silence is itself a faculty and a sister of that one which is developed in speech, arranging what is to be said with reference to time—but that silence which the sick and the weary against their will endure, on account of the strength of their antagonists, because they cannot find any handle to answer them;</s></p>
</div>
<div n="38" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section38"><s id="section38sent1">for whatever they touch slips away from them, and whatever thing they seek to take their stand on does not remain, so that they of necessity fall before they stand, like that hydrostatic machine called the helix; for in the middle of that engine there are some steps, which the husbandman when he desires to water his fields mounts up upon, but is rolled round of necessity; and in order to avoid falling he is continually catching at the nearest firm thing that he can lay his hands on, which he takes hold of and so supports his whole body; for instead of his hands he uses his feet, and instead of his feet he uses his hands; for he stands on his hands, by means of which, actions are usually done, and he acts with his feet on which it is natural to stand.</s></p>
</div>
<div n="39" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section39"><s id="section39sent1">But many, who are not able vigorously to refute the plausible inventions of the sophists, because they have not very much practised discussion by reason of their continued application to action, have taken refuge in the alliance of the only wise Being, and have besought him to become their defender.</s><s id="section39sent2">As one of the friends of Moses, when praying, says in his hymns, "Let the treacherous lips become mute;"  and how can they become mute if they are not curbed by the only</s><s id="section39sent3">being who has speech itself as his subject?</s></p>
</div>
<div n="40" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section40"><s id="section40sent1">We must therefore flee, without ever turning back, from all associations entered into for the purposes of sin; but the alliance made with the companions of wisdom and knowledge must be confirmed.</s></p>

<p id="Section41"><s id="section41sent1">In reference to which I admire those who say, "We are all one man's sons, we are men of peace,"  because of their well-adapted agreement; since how, I should say, could you, O excellent men, avoid being grieved at war, and delighted in peace, being the sons of one and the same father, and he not mortal but immortal, the man of God, who being the reason of the everlasting God, is of necessity himself also immortal?</s></p>

<div n="42" subtype="section" type="textpart">
<p id="Section42"><s id="section42sent1">For they who make out many beginnings of the origin of the soul, being devoted to the evil which is called polytheism, and turning each individual of them, to the honour of different beings, having caused great confusion and dissension both at home and abroad, from the beginning of their birth to the end of their life, filling life with irreconcilable quarrels;</s></p>
