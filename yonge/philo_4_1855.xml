            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON A CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE, OR ON THE VIRTUES OF SUPPLIANTS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. HAVING mentioned the Essenes, who in all respects se­ <lb/>
            lected for their admiration and for their especial adoption the <lb/>
            practical course of life, and who excel in all, or what perhaps <lb/>
            may be a less unpopular and invidious thing to say, in most <lb/>
            of its parts, I will now proceed, in the regular order of my <lb/>
            subject, to speak of those who have embraced the speculative <lb/>
            life, and I will say what appears to me to be desirable to be <lb/>
            said on the subject, not drawing any fictitious statements <lb/>
            from my own head for the sake of improving the appearance <lb/>
            of that side of the question which nearly all poets and essay­ <lb/>
            ists are much accustomed to do in the scarcity of good <lb/>
            actions to extol, but with the greatest simplicity adhering <lb/>
            strictly to the truth itself, to which I know well that even the <lb/>
            most eloquent men do not keep close in their speeches.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless we must make the endeavour and labour to <lb/>
            attain to this virtue ; for it is not right that the greatness of <lb/>
            the virtue of the men should be a cause of silence to those who <lb/>
            do not think it right that anything which is creditable should <lb/>
            be suppressed in silence ; but the deliberate intention of the <lb/>
            philosopher is at once displayed from the appellation given to <lb/>
            them; for with strict regard to etymology, they are called <lb/>
            therapeutæ and therapeutrides,* either because they profess <lb/>
            an art of medicine more excellent than that in general use in <lb/>
            cities (for that only heals bodies, but the other heals souls <lb/>
            which are under the mastery of terrible and almost incurable <lb/>
            diseases, which pleasures and appetites, fears and griefs, and <lb/>
            covetousness, and follies, and injustice, and all the rest of the <lb/>
            innumerable multitude of other passions and vices, have in­ <lb/>
            flicted upon them), or else because they have been instructed <lb/>
            by nature and the sacred laws to serve the living God, who is <note type="footnote"> * From <foreign xml:lang="grc">θεραπεύω</foreign>, " to heal." </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            superior to the good, and more simple than the one, and more <lb/>
            ancient than the unit; with whom, however, who is there of <lb/>
            those who profess piety that we can possibly compare ? Can <lb/>
            we compare those who honour the elements, earth, water, air, <lb/>
            and fire? to whom different nations have given different <lb/>
            names, calling fire Hephæstus, I imagine because of its kin­ <lb/>
            dling,* and the air Hera, I imagine because of its being raised <lb/>
            up,f and raised aloft to a great height, and water Poseidon, <lb/>
            probably because of its being drinkable,J and the earth Deme­ <lb/>
            ter, because it appears to be the mother § of all plants and of <lb/>
            all animals.</p>
          <p>But these names are the inventions of sophists: but the <lb/>
            elements are inanimate matter, and immovable by any power <lb/>
            of their own, being subjected to the operator on them to <lb/>
            receive from bim every kind of shape or distinctive quality <lb/>
            which he chooses to give them. But what shall we say of <lb/>
            those men who worship the perfect things made of them, <lb/>
            the sun, the moon, and the other stars, planets, or fixed-stars, <lb/>
            or the whole heaven, or the universal world? And yet even <lb/>
            they do not owe their existence to themselves, but to some <lb/>
            creator whose knowledge has been most perfect, both in mind <lb/>
            and degree. What, again, shall we say of the demi-gods? <lb/>
            This is a matter which is perfectly ridiculous : for how can the <lb/>
            same man be both mortal and immortal, even if we leave out <lb/>
            of the question the fact that the origin of the birth of all these <lb/>
            beings is liable to reproach, as being full of youthful intempe­ <lb/>
            rance, which its authors endeavour with great profanity to <lb/>
            impute to blessed and divine natures, as if they, being madly <lb/>
            in love with mortal women, had connected themselves with <lb/>
            them; while we know gods to be free from all participation in <lb/>
            and from all influence of passion, and completely happy.</p>
          <p>Again, what shall we say of those who worship carved <lb/>
            works and images ? the substances of which, stone and wood, <lb/>
            were only a little while before perfectly destitute of shape, <note type="footnote"> * The Greek is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἒξαψις</foreign>, as if "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ηφαιστος</foreign> were also derived from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἃπτομαι</foreign>, being akin to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀφὴ</foreign>. </note><note type="footnote"> t The Greek word is aï<foreign xml:lang="grc">ρεσθ</foreign>a<foreign xml:lang="grc">ι</foreign>, to which "Hpa has some similarity in <lb/>

            before the stone-cutters or wood-cutters hewed them out of the <lb/>
            kindred stuff around them, while the remainder of the material, <lb/>
            their near relation and brother as it were, is made into ewers, <lb/>
            or foot-pans, and other common and dishonoured vessels, which <lb/>
            are employed rather for uses of darkness than for such as will <lb/>
            bear the light; for as for the customs of the Egyptians, it is <lb/>
            not creditable even to mention them, for they have introduced <lb/>
            irrational beasts, and those not merely such as are domestic and <lb/>
            tame, but even the most ferocious of wild beasts to share the <lb/>
            honours of the gods, taking some out of each of the elements <lb/>
            beneath the moon, as the lion from among the animals which <lb/>
            live on the earth, the crocodile from among those which live <lb/>
            in the water, the kite from such as traverse the air, and the <lb/>
            Egyptian iris. And though they actually see that these animals <lb/>
            are born, and that they are in need of food, and that they are <lb/>
            insatiable in voracity and full of all sorts of filth, and moreover <lb/>
            poisonous and devourers of men, and liable to be destroyed by <lb/>
            all kinds of diseases, and that in fact they are often destroyed <lb/>
            not only, by natural deaths, but also by violence, still they, <lb/>
            civilised men, worship these untameable and ferocious beasts; <lb/>
            though rational men, they worship irrational beasts; though <lb/>
            they have a near relationship to the Deity, they worship <lb/>
            creatures unworthy of being compared even to some of the <lb/>
            beasts; though appointed as rulers and masters, they worship <lb/>
            creatures which are by nature subjects and slaves.</p>
          <p>II. But since these men infect not only their fellow <lb/>
            countrymen, but also all that come near them with folly, let <lb/>
            them remain uncovered, being mutilated in that most indis­ <lb/>
            pensable of all the outward senses, namely, sight. I am <lb/>
            speaking here not of the sight of the body, but of that of the <lb/>
            soul, by which alone truth and falsehood are distinguished from <lb/>
            one another. But the therapeutic sect of mankind, being con­ <lb/>
            tinually taught to see without interruption, may well aim at <lb/>
            obtaining a sight of the living God, and may pass by the sun, <lb/>
            which is visible to the outward sense, and never leave this <lb/>
            order which conducts to perfect happiness. But they who <lb/>
            apply themselves to this kind of worship, not because they are <lb/>
            influenced to do so by custom, nor by the advice or recommen­ <lb/>
            dation of any particular persons, but because they are carried <lb/>
            away by a certain heavenly love, give way to enthusiasm, <lb/>
            behaving like so many revellers in bacchanalian or corybantiau <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            mysteries, until they see the object which they have been <lb/>
            earnestly desiring.</p>
          <p>Then, because of their anxious desire for an immortal and <lb/>
            blessed existence, thinking that their mortal life has already <lb/>
            come to an end, they leave their possessions to their sons or <lb/>
            daughters, or perhaps to other relations, giving them up their <lb/>
            inheritance with willing cheerfulness; and those who know no <lb/>
            relations give their property to their companions or friends, for <lb/>
            it followed of necessity that those who have acquired the <lb/>
            wealth which sees, as if ready prepared for them, should be <lb/>
            willing to surrender that wealth which is blind to those who <lb/>
            themselves'also are still blind in their minds.</p>
          <p>The Greeks celebrate Anaxagoras and Democritus, because <lb/>
            they, being smitten with a desire for philosophy, allowed all <lb/>
            their estates to be devoured by cattle. I myself admire the <lb/>
            men who thus showed themselves superior to the attractions <lb/>
            of money; but how much better were those who have not per­ <lb/>
            mitted cattle to devour their possessions, but have supplied the <lb/>
            necessities of mankind. of their own relations and friends, and <lb/>
            have made them rich though they were poor before ? For <lb/>
            surely that was inconsiderate conduct (that I may avoid saying <lb/>
            that any action of men whom Greece has agreed to admire <lb/>
            was a piece of insanity) ; but this is the act of sober men, <lb/>
            and one which has been carefully elaborated by exceeding <lb/>
            prudence.</p>
          <p>For what more can enemies do than ravage, and destroy, <lb/>
            and cut down all the trees in the country of their antagonists, <lb/>
            that they may be forced to submit by reason of the extent to <lb/>
            which they are oppressed by want of necessaries ? And yet <lb/>
            Democritus did this to his own blood relations, inflicting <lb/>
            artificial want and penury upon them, not perhaps from any <lb/>
            hostile intention towards them, but because he did not foresee <lb/>
            and provide for what was advantageous to others. How much <lb/>
            better and more admirable are they who, without having any <lb/>
            inferior eagerness for the attainment of philosophy, have <lb/>
            nevertheless preferred magnanimity to carelessness, and, giving <lb/>
            presents from their possessions instead of destroying them, so <lb/>
            as to be able to benefit others and themselves also, have <lb/>
            made others happy by imparting to them of the abundance of <lb/>
            their wealth, and themselves by the study of philosophy? <lb/>
            For an undue care for money and wealth causes great waste <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            of time, and it is proper to economise time, since, according <lb/>
            to the saying of the celebrated physician Hippocrates, life is <lb/>
            short but art long. And this is what Homer appears to me to <lb/>
            imply figuratively in the Iliad, at the beginning of the <lb/>
            thirteenth book, by the following lines,­ <lb/>
            " The Mysian close-fighting bands, <lb/>
            And dwellers on the Scythian lands, <lb/>
            Content to seek their humble fare <lb/>
            From milk of cow and milk of mare, <lb/>
            The justest of mankind." * <lb/>
            As if great anxiety concerning the means of subsistence and <lb/>
            the acquisition of money engendered injustice by reason of <lb/>
            the inequality which it produced, while the contrary dispo­ <lb/>
            sition and pursuit produced justice by reason of its equality, <lb/>
            according to which it is that the wealth of nature is defined, <lb/>
            and is superior to that which exists only in vain opinion.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, men abandon their property without being <lb/>
            influenced by any predominant attraction, they flee without <lb/>
            even turning their heads back again, deserting their brethren, <lb/>
            their children, their wives, their parents, their numerous <lb/>
            families, their affectionate bands of companions, their native <lb/>
            lands in which they have been born and brought up, though <lb/>
            long familiarity is a most attractive bond, and one very well <lb/>
            able to allure any one. And they depart, not to another city <lb/>
            as those do who entreat to be purchased from those who at <lb/>
            present possess them, being either unfortunate or else worth­ <lb/>
            less servants, and as such seeking a change of masters rather <lb/>
            than endeavouring to procure freedom (for every city, even <lb/>
            that which is under the happiest laws, is full of indescribable <lb/>
            tumults, and disorders, and calamities, which no one would <lb/>
            submit to who had been even for a moment under the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of wisdom), but they take up their abode outside of <lb/>
            walls, or gardens, or solitary lauds, seeking for a desert place, <lb/>
            not because of any ill-natured misanthropy to which they <lb/>
            have learnt to devote themselves, but because of the associa­ <lb/>
            tions with people of wholly dissimilar dispositions to which <lb/>
            they would otherwise be compelled, and which they know to <lb/>
            be unprofitable and mischievous.</p>
          <p>III. Now this class of persons may be met with in many <lb/>
            places, for it was fitting that both Greece and the country <note type="footnote"> * B. xiii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            of the barbarians should partake of whatever is perfectly <lb/>
            good; and there is the greatest number of such men in Egypt, <lb/>
            in every one of the districts, or nomi as they are called, and <lb/>
            especially around Alexandria ; and from all quarters those <lb/>
            who are the best of these therapeutæ proceed on their pil­ <lb/>
            grimage to some most suitable place as if it were their country, <lb/>
            which is beyond the Mareotic lake, lying in a somewhat level <lb/>
            plain a little raised above the rest, being suitable for their <lb/>
            purpose by reason of its safety and also of the fine tempe­ <lb/>
            rature of the air.</p>
          <p>For the houses built in the fields and the villages which <lb/>
            surround it on all sides give it safety; and the admirable tem­ <lb/>
            perature of the air proceeds from the continual breezes which <lb/>
            come from the lake which falls into the sea, and also from the <lb/>
            sea itself in the neighbourhood, the breezes from the sea <lb/>
            being light, and those which proceed from the lake which falls <lb/>
            into the sea being heavy, the mixture of which produces a <lb/>
            most healthy atmosphere.</p>
          <p>But the houses of these men thus congregated together are <lb/>
            very plain, just giving shelter in respect of the two things <lb/>
            most important to be provided against, the heat of the sun, <lb/>
            and the cold from the open air ; and they did not live near to one <lb/>
            another as men do in cities, for immediate neighbourhood to <lb/>
            others would be a troublesome and unpleasant thing to men <lb/>
            who have conceived an admiration for, and have determined to <lb/>
            devote themselves to, solitude; and, on the other hand, they <lb/>
            did not live very far from one another on account of the <lb/>
            fellowship which they desire to cultivate, and because of the <lb/>
            desirableness of being able to assist one another if they <lb/>
            should be attacked by robbers.</p>
          <p>And in every house there is a sacred shrine which is called <lb/>
            the holy place, and the monastery in which they retire by <lb/>
            themselves and perform all the mysteries of a holy life, bring­ <lb/>
            ing in nothing, neither meat, nor drink, nor anything else <lb/>
            which is indispensable towards supplying the necessities of <lb/>
            the body, but studying in that place the laws and the sacred <lb/>
            oracles of God enunciated by the holy prophets, and hymns, <lb/>
            and psalms, and all kinds of other things by reason of which <lb/>
            knowledge and piety are increased and brought to perfection.</p>
          <p>Therefore they always retain an imperishable recollection of <lb/>
            God, so that not even in their dreams is any other object ever <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            presented to their eyes except the beauty of the divine <lb/>
            virtues and of the divine powers. Therefore many persons <lb/>
            speak in their sleep, divulging and publishing the celebrated <lb/>
            doctrines of the sacred philosophy. And they are accustomed <lb/>
            to pray twice every day, at morning and at evening; when the <lb/>
            sun is rising entreating God that the happiness of the coming <lb/>
            day may be real happiness, so that their minds may be filled <lb/>
            with heavenly light, and when the sun is setting they pray <lb/>
            that their soul, being entirely lightened and relieved of the <lb/>
            burden of the outward senses, and of the appropriate object <lb/>
            of these outward senses, may be able to trace out truth existing <lb/>
            in its own consistory and council chamber. And the interval <lb/>
            between morning and evening is by them devoted wholly to <lb/>
            meditation on and to practice of virtue, for they take up the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures and philosophise concerning them, investigat­ <lb/>
            ing the allegories of their national philosophy, since they look <lb/>
            upon their literal expressions as symbols of some secret mean­ <lb/>
            ing of nature, intended to be conveyed in those figurative <lb/>
            expressions.</p>
          <p>They have also writings of ancient men, who having been <lb/>
            the founders of one sect or another have left behind them <lb/>
            many memorials of the allegorical system of writing and <lb/>
            explanation, whom they take as a kind of model, and imitate <lb/>
            the general fashion of their sect; so that they do not occupy <lb/>
            themselves solely in contemplation, but they likewise compose <lb/>
            psalms and hymns to God in every kind of metre and melody <lb/>
            imaginable, which they of necessity arrange in more dignified <lb/>
            rhythm. Therefore, during six days, each of these individuals, <lb/>
            retiring into solitude by himself, philosophises by himself in <lb/>
            one of the places called monasteries, never going outside the <lb/>
            threshold of the outer court, and indeed never even looking <lb/>
            out.</p>
          <p>But on the seventh day they all come together as if to meet <lb/>
            in a sacred assembly, and they sit down in order according to <lb/>
            their ages with all becoming gravity, keeping their bands <lb/>
            inside their garments, having their right hand between their <lb/>
            chest and their dress, and the left hand down by their side, <lb/>
            close to their flank ; and then the eldest of them who has the <lb/>
            most profound learning in their doctrines comes forward and <lb/>
            speaks with steadfast look and with steadfast voice, with great <lb/>
            powers of reasoning, and great prudence, not making an <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            exhibition of his oratorical powers like the rhetoricians of old, <lb/>
            or the sophists of the present day, but investigating with great <lb/>
            pains, and explaining with minute accuracy the precise mean­ <lb/>
            ing of the laws, which sits, not indeed at the tips of their <lb/>
            ears, but penetrates through their hearing into the soul, and <lb/>
            remains there lastingly; and all the rest listen in silence <lb/>
            to the praises which he bestows upon the law, showing their <lb/>
            assent only by nods of the head, or the eager look of the eyes.</p>
          <p>And this common holy place to which they all come to­ <lb/>
            gether on the seventh day is a twofold circuit, being separated <lb/>
            partly into the apartment of the men, and partly into a <lb/>
            chamber for the women, for women also, in accordance with <lb/>
            the usual fashion there, form a part of the audience, having the <lb/>
            same feelings of admiration as the men, and having adopted <lb/>
            the same sect with equal deliberation and decision; and the <lb/>
            wall which is between the houses rises from the ground three <lb/>
            or four cubits upwards, like a battlement, and the upper <lb/>
            portion rises upwards to the roof without any opening, on two <lb/>
            accounts; first of all, in order that the modesty which is so <lb/>
            becoming to the female sex may be preserved, and secondly, <lb/>
            that the women may be easily able to comprehend what is <lb/>
            said being seated within earshot, since there is then nothing <lb/>
            which can possibly intercept the voice of him who is speak­ <lb/>
            ing.</p>
          <p>IV. And these expounders of the law, having first of all laid <lb/>
            down temperance as a sort of foundation for the soul to rest <lb/>
            upon, proceed to build up other virtues on this foundation, and <lb/>
            no one of them may take any meat or drink before the setting <lb/>
            of the sun, since they judge that the work of philosophising is <lb/>
            one which is worthy of the light, but that the care for the <lb/>
            necessities of the body is suitable only to darkness, on which <lb/>
            account they appropriate the day to the one occupation, and a <lb/>
            brief portion of the night to the other; and some men, in <lb/>
            whom there is implanted a more fervent desire of knowledge, <lb/>
            can endure to cherish a recollection of their food for three <lb/>
            days without even tasting it, and some men are so delighted, <lb/>
            and enjoy themselves so exceedingly when regaled by wisdom <lb/>
            which supplies them with her doctrines in all possible wealth <lb/>
            and abundance, that they can even hold out twice as great a <lb/>
            length of time, and will scarcely at the end of six days taste <lb/>
            even necessary food, being accustomed, as they say that grass <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            hoppers are, to feed on air, their song, as I imagine, making <lb/>
            their scarcity tolerable to them.</p>
          <p>And they, looking upon the seventh day as one of perfect <lb/>
            holiness and a most complete festival, have thought it worthy <lb/>
            of a most especial honour, and on it, after taking due care of <lb/>
            their soul, they tend their bodies also, giving them, just as <lb/>
            they do to their cattle, a complete rest from their continual <lb/>
            labours ; and they eat nothing of a costly character, but plain <lb/>
            bread and a seasoning of salt, which the more luxurious of <lb/>
            them do further season with hyssop ; and their drink is water <lb/>
            from the spring; for they oppose those feelings which nature <lb/>
            has made mistresses of the human race, namely, hunger and <lb/>
            thirst, giving them nothing to flatter or humour them, but <lb/>
            only such useful things as it is not possible to exist without. <lb/>
            On this account they eat only so far as not to be hungry, and <lb/>
            they drink just enough to escape from thirst, avoiding all <lb/>
            satiety, as an enemy of and a plotter against both soul and <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>And there are two kinds of covering, one raiment and <lb/>
            the other a house: we have already spoken of their houses, <lb/>
            that they are not decorated with any ornaments, but run up <lb/>
            in a hurry, being only made to answer such purposes as are <lb/>
            absolutely necessary; and in like manner their raiment is of <lb/>
            the most ordinary description, just stout enough to ward off <lb/>
            cold and heat, being a cloak of some shaggy hide for winter, <lb/>
            and a thin mantle or linen shawl in the summer; for in short <lb/>
            they practise entire simplicity, looking upon falsehood as the <lb/>
            foundation of pride, but truth as the origin of simplicity, and <lb/>
            upon truth and falsehood as standing in the light of fountains, <lb/>
            for from falsehood proceeds every variety of evil and wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, and from truth there flows every imaginable abundance <lb/>
            of good things both human and divine.</p>
          <p>V. I wish also to speak of their common assemblies, and <lb/>
            their very cheerful meetings at convivial parties, setting them <lb/>
            in opposition and contrast to the banquets of others, for others, <lb/>
            when they drink strong wine, as if they had been drinking not <lb/>
            wine but some agitating and maddening kind of liquor, or <lb/>
            even the most formidable thing which can be imagined for <lb/>
            driving a man out of his natural reason, rage about and tear <lb/>
            things to pieces like so many ferocious dogs, aDd rise up and <lb/>
            attack one another, biting and gnawing each other's noses, and <lb/>
             <pb n="10"/>
            ears, and fingers, and other parts of their body, so as to give <lb/>
            an accurate representation of the story related about the <lb/>
            Cyclops and the companions of Ulysses, who ate, as the poet <lb/>
            says, fragments of human flesh,* and that more savagely than <lb/>
            even he himself; for he was only avenging himself on those <lb/>
            whom he conceived to be his enemies, but they were ill-treating <lb/>
            their companions and friends, and sometimes even their actual <lb/>
            relations, while having the salt and dinner-table before them, <lb/>
            at a time of peace perpetrating actions inconsistent with <lb/>
            peace, like those which are done by men in gymnastic con­ <lb/>
            tests, debasing the proper exercises of the body as coiners <lb/>
            debase good money, and instead of athletes (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀθληται̃</foreign>) becoming <lb/>
            miserable men (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἅθλιοι</foreign>), for ithat is the name which properly <lb/>
            belongs to them.</p>
          <p>For that which those men who gain victories in the Olympic <lb/>
            games, when perfectly sober in the arena, and having all the <lb/>
            Greeks for spectators do by day, exerting all their skill for the <lb/>
            purpose of gaining victory and the crown, these men with base <lb/>
            designs do at convivial entertainments, getting drunk by night, <lb/>
            in the hour of darkness, when soaked in wine, acting without <lb/>
            either knowledge, or art, or skill, to the insult, and injury, <lb/>
            and great disgrace of those who are subjected to their violence.</p>
          <p>And if no one were to come like an umpire into the middle <lb/>
            of them, and part the combatants, and reconcile them, they <lb/>
            would continue the contest with unlimited licence, striving to <lb/>
            kill and murder one another, and being killed and murdered <lb/>
            on the spot; for they do not suffer less than they inflict, <lb/>
            though out of the delirious state into which they have worked <lb/>
            themselves they do not feel what is done to them, since they <lb/>
            have filled themselves with wine, not, as the comic poet says, <lb/>
            to the injury of their neighbour, but to their own. Therefore <lb/>
            those persons who a little while before came safe and sound to <lb/>
            the banquet, and in friendship for one another, do presently <lb/>
            afterwards depart in hostility and mutilated in their bodies.</p>
          <p>And some of these men stand in need of advocates and <lb/>
            judges, and others require surgeons and physicians, and the <lb/>
            help which may be received from them. Others again who <lb/>
            seem to be a more moderate kind of feasters when they have <lb/>
            drunk unmixed wine as if it were mandragora, boil over as it <lb/>
            were, and lean on their left elbow, and turn their heads on <note type="footnote"> * Odyssey ix. 35;i. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            one side with their breath redolent of their wine, till at last <lb/>
            they sink into profound slumber, neither seeing nor hearing <lb/>
            anything, as if they had but one single sense, and that the <lb/>
            most slavish of all, namely, taste. And I know some persons <lb/>
            who, when they are completely filled with wine, before they are <lb/>
            wholly overpowered by it, begin to prepare a drinking party <lb/>
            for the next day by a kind of subscription and picnic contribution, <lb/>
            conceiving a great part of their present delight to consist in <lb/>
            the hope of future drunkenness; and in this manner they exist <lb/>
            to the very end of their lives, without a house and without a <lb/>
            home, the enemies of their parents, and of their wives, and of <lb/>
            their children, and the enemies of their country, and the worst <lb/>
            enemies of all to themselves. For a debauched and profligate <lb/>
            life is apt to lay snares for every one.</p>
          <p>VI. And perhaps some people may be inclined to approve <lb/>
            of the arrangement of such entertainments which at present <lb/>
            prevails everywhere, from an admiration of, and a desire of <lb/>
            imitating, the luxury and extravagance of the Italians which <lb/>
            both Greeks and barbarians emulate, making all their pre­ <lb/>
            parations with a view to show rather than to real enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment, for they use couches called triclinia, and sofas all round <lb/>
            the table made of tortoiseshell, and ivory, and other costly <lb/>
            materials, most of which are inlaid with precious stones; and <lb/>
            coverlets of purple embroidered with gold and silver thread; <lb/>
            and others brocaded in flowers of every kind of hue and colour <lb/>
            imaginable to allure the sight, and a vast array of drinking <lb/>
            cups arrayed according to each separate description; for there <lb/>
            are bowls, and vases, and beakers, and goblets, and all kinds <lb/>
            of other vessels wrought with the most exquisite skill, their <lb/>
            clean cups and others finished with the most elaborate refine­ <lb/>
            ment of skilful and ingenious men ; and well shaped slaves of <lb/>
            the most exquisite beauty, ministering, as if they had come <lb/>
            not more for the purpose of serving the guests than of delight­ <lb/>
            ing the eyes of the spectators by their mere appearance.</p>
          <p>Of these slaves, some, being still boys, pour out the wine; <lb/>
            and others more fully grown pour water, being carefully washed <lb/>
            and rubbed down, with their faces anointed and pencilled, and <lb/>
            the hair of their heads admirably plaited and curled and <lb/>
            wreathed in delicate knots; for they have very long hair, being <lb/>
            either completely unshorn, or else having only the hair on <lb/>
            their foreheads cut at the end so as to make them of an equal <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            length all round, being accurately sloped away so as to repre­ <lb/>
            sent a circular line, and being clothed in tunics of the most <lb/>
            delicate texture, and of the purest white, reaching in front <lb/>
            down to the lower part of the knee, and behind to a little <lb/>
            below the calf of the leg, and drawing up each side with a <lb/>
            gentle doubling of the fringe at the joinings of the tunics, <lb/>
            raising undulations of the garment as it were at the sides, and <lb/>
            widening them at the hollow part of the side.</p>
          <p>Others, again, are young men just beginning to show a <lb/>
            beard on their youthful chins, having been, for a short time, the <lb/>
            sport of the profligate debauchees, and being prepared with <lb/>
            exceeding care and diligence for more painful services; being <lb/>
            a kind of exhibition of the excessive opulence of the giver of <lb/>
            the feast, or rather, to say the truth, of their thorough <lb/>
            ignorance of all propriety, as those who are acquainted with <lb/>
            them well know.</p>
          <p>Besides all these things, there is an infinite variety of sweet- <lb/>
            meats, and delicacies, and confections, about which bakers and <lb/>
            cooks and confectioners labour, considering not the taste, which <lb/>
            is the point of real importance, so as to make the food palatable <lb/>
            to that, but also the sight, so as to allure that by the delicacy <lb/>
            of the look of their viands. Accordingly, seven tables, and <lb/>
            often more, are brought in, full of every kind of delicacy which <lb/>
            earth, and sea, and rivers, and air produce, all procured with <lb/>
            great pains, and in high condition, composed of terrestrial, and <lb/>
            acquatic, and flying creatures, every one of which is different <lb/>
            both in its mode of dressing and in its seasoning.</p>
          <p>And that no description of thing existing in nature may be <lb/>
            omitted, at the last dishes are brought in full of fruits, besides <lb/>
            those which are kept back for the more luxurious portion of <lb/>
            the entertainment, and for what is called the dessert; and <lb/>
            afterwards some of the dishes are carried away empty from the <lb/>
            insatiable greediness of those at table, who, gorging themselves <lb/>
            like cormorants, devour all the delicacies so completely that <lb/>
            they gnaw even the bones, which some left half devoured after <lb/>
            all that they contained has been torn to pieces and spoiled. <lb/>
            And when they are completely tired with eating, having their <lb/>
            bellies filled up to their very throats, but their desires still <lb/>
            unsatisfied, being fatigued with eating they turn their heads <lb/>
            round in every direction, scanning everything with their eyes <lb/>
            and with their nostrils, examining the richness and the number <lb/>
             <pb n="13"/>
            of the dishes with the first, and the steam which is sent up by <lb/>
            them with the second.</p>
          <p>Then, when they are thoroughly sated both with the sight <lb/>
            and with the scent, these senses again prompt their owners to <lb/>
            eat, praising in no moderate terms both the entertainment <lb/>
            itself and the giver of it, for its costliness and magnificence. <lb/>
            However, why need I dwell with prolixity on these matters, <lb/>
            which are already condemned by the generality of more <lb/>
            moderate men as inflaming the passions, the diminution of <lb/>
            which is desirable? For any one in his senses would pray for <lb/>
            the most unfortunate of all states, hunger and thirst, rather <lb/>
            than for a most unlimited abundance of meat and drink at <lb/>
            such banquets as these.</p>
          <p>VII. Now of the banquets among the Greeks the two most <lb/>
            celebrated and most remarkable are those at which Socrates <lb/>
            also was present, the one in the house of Callias, when, after <lb/>
            Autolycus had gained the crown of victory, he gave a feast in <lb/>
            honour of the event, and the other in the house of Agathon, <lb/>
            which was thought worthy of being commemorated by men <lb/>
            who were imbued with the true spirit of philosophy both in <lb/>
            their dispositions and in their discourses, Plato and Xenophon, <lb/>
            for they recorded them as events worthy to be had in perpetual <lb/>
            recollection, looking upon it that future generations would take <lb/>
            them as models for a well managed arrangement of future <lb/>
            banquets; but nevertheless even these, if compared with the <lb/>
            banquets of the men of our time who have embraced the con­ <lb/>
            templative system of life, will appear ridiculous. Each descrip­ <lb/>
            tion, indeed, has its own pleasures, but that recorded by Xeno­ <lb/>
            phon is the one the delights of which are most in accordance <lb/>
            with human nature, for female harp-players, and dancers, and <lb/>
            conjurors, and jugglers, and men who do ridiculous things, who <lb/>
            pride themselves much on their powers of jesting and of <lb/>
            amusing others, and many other species of more cheerful <lb/>
            relaxation, are brought forward at it. But the entertainment <lb/>
            recorded by Plato is almost entirely connected with love ; not <lb/>
            that of men madly desirous or fond of women, or of women <lb/>
            furiously in love with men, for these desires are accomplished <lb/>
            in accordance with a law of nature, but with that love which is <lb/>
            felt by men for one another, differing only in respect of age; <lb/>
            for if there is anything in the account of that banquet elegantly <lb/>
            said in praise of genuine love and heavenly Venus, it is <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            introduced merely for the sake of making a neat speech; for <lb/>
            the greater part of the book is occupied by common, vulgar, <lb/>
            promiscuous love, which takes away from the soul courage, <lb/>
            that which is the most serviceable of all virtues both in war <lb/>
            and in peace, and which engenders in it instead the female <lb/>
            disease, and renders men men-women, though they ought <lb/>
            rather to be carefully trained in all the practices likely to give <lb/>
            men valour.</p>
          <p>And having corrupted the age of boys, and having metamor­ <lb/>
            phosed them and removed them into the classification and <lb/>
            character of women, it has injured their lovers also in the most <lb/>
            important particulars, their bodies, their souls, and their <lb/>
            properties; for it follows of necessity that the mind of a lover <lb/>
            of boys must be kept on the stretch towards the objects of his <lb/>
            affection, and must have no acuteness of vision for any other <lb/>
            object, but must be blinded by its desire as to all other <lb/>
            objects private or common, and must so be wasted away, more <lb/>
            especially if it fails in its objects. Moreover, the man's <lb/>
            property must be diminished on two accounts, both from the <lb/>
            owner's neglect and from his expenses for the beloved object.</p>
          <p>There is also another greater evil which affects the whole <lb/>
            people, and which grows up alongside of the other, for men <lb/>
            who give into such passions produce solitude in cities, and a <lb/>
            scarcity of the best kind of men, and barrenness, and unpro­ <lb/>
            ductiveness, inasmuch as they are imitating those farmers who <lb/>
            are unskilful in agriculture, and who, instead of the deep-soiled <lb/>
            champaign country, sow briny marshes, or stony and rugged <lb/>
            districts, which are not calculated to produce crops of any kind, <lb/>
            and which only destroy the seed which is put into them. I <lb/>
            pass over in silence the different fabulous fictions, and the <lb/>
            stories of persons with two bodies, who having originally been <lb/>
            stuck to one another by amatory influences, are subsequently <lb/>
            separated like portions which have been brought together and <lb/>
            are disjoined again, the harmony having been dissolved by <lb/>
            which they were held together; for all these things are very <lb/>
            attractive, being able by the novelty of their imagination to <lb/>
            allure the ears, but they are despised by the disciples of <lb/>
            Moses, who in the abundance of their wisdom have learnt <lb/>
            from their earliest infancy to love truth, and also continue to <lb/>
            the end of their lives impossible to be deceived.</p>
          <p>VIII. But since the entertainments of the greatest celebrity <lb/>
             <pb n="15"/>
            are full of such trifling and folly, bearing conviction in them­ <lb/>
            selves, if any one should think fit not to regard vague opinion <lb/>
            and the character which has been commonly handed down <lb/>
            concerning them as feasts which have gone off with the most <lb/>
            eminent success, I will oppose to them the entertainments of <lb/>
            those persons who have devoted their whole life and themselves <lb/>
            to the knowledge and contemplation of the affairs of nature in <lb/>
            accordance with the most sacred admonitions and precepts of <lb/>
            the prophet Moses.</p>
          <p>In the first place, these men assemble at the end of seven <lb/>
            weeks, venerating not only the simple week of seven days, but <lb/>
            also its multiplied power, for they know it to be pure and <lb/>
            always virgin; and it is a prelude and a kind of forefeast of <lb/>
            the greatest feast, which is assigned to the number fifty, the <lb/>
            most holy and natural of numbers, being compounded of the <lb/>
            power of the right-angled triangle, which is the principle of the <lb/>
            origination and condition of the whole.</p>
          <p>Therefore when they come together clothed in white <lb/>
            garments, and joyful with the most exceeding gravity, when <lb/>
            some one of the epbemereutæ (for that is the appellation <lb/>
            which they are accustomed to give to those who are employed <lb/>
            in such ministrations), before they sit down to meat standing <lb/>
            in order in a row, and raising their eyes and their hands to <lb/>
            heaven, the one because they have learnt to fix their attention <lb/>
            on what is worth looking at, and the other because they are <lb/>
            free from the reproach of all impure gain, being never polluted <lb/>
            under any pretence whatever by any description of criminality <lb/>
            which can arise from any means taken to procure advantage, <lb/>
            they pray to God that the entertainment may be acceptable, <lb/>
            and welcome, and pleasing; and after having offered up these <lb/>
            prayers the elders sit down to meat, still observing the order in <lb/>
            which they were previously arranged, for they do not look on <lb/>
            those as elders who are advanced in years and very ancient, but <lb/>
            in some cases they esteem those as very young men, if they have <lb/>
            attached themselves to this sect only lately, but those whom <lb/>
            they call elders are those who from their earliest infancy have <lb/>
            grown up and arrived at maturity in the speculative portion 01 <lb/>
            philosophy, which is the most beautiful and most divine part <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>And the women also share in this feast, the greater part of <lb/>
            whom, though old, are virgins in respect of their purity (not <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            indeed through necessity, as some of the priestesses among the <lb/>
            Greeks are, who have been compelled to preserve their chastity <lb/>
            more than they would have done of their own accord), but out <lb/>
            of an admiration for and love of wisdom, with which they are <lb/>
            desirous to pass their lives, on account of which they are indif­ <lb/>
            ferent to the pleasures of the body, desiring not a mortal but <lb/>
            an immortal offspring, which the soul that is attached to God <lb/>
            is alone able to produce by itself and from itself, the Father <lb/>
            having sown in it rays of light appreciable only by the intel­ <lb/>
            lect, by means of which it will be able to perceive the doctrines <lb/>
            of wisdom.</p>
          <p>IX. And the order in which they sit down to meat is a <lb/>
            divided one, the men sitting on the right hand and the women <lb/>
            apart from them on the left; and in case any one by chance <lb/>
            suspects that cushions, if not very costly ones, still at all events <lb/>
            of a tolerably soft substance, are prepared for men who are <lb/>
            well born and well bred, and contemplators of philosophy, he <lb/>
            must know that they have nothing but rugs of the coarsest <lb/>
            materials, cheap mats of the most ordinary kind of the papyrus <lb/>
            of the land, piled up on the ground and projecting a little near <lb/>
            the elbow, so that the feasters may lean upon them, for they <lb/>
            relax in a slight degree the Lacedaemonian rigour of life, and <lb/>
            at all times and in all places they practise a liberal, gentle­ <lb/>
            manlike kind of frugality, hating the allurements of pleasure <lb/>
            with all their might.</p>
          <p>And they do not use the ministrations of slaves, looking <lb/>
            upon the possession of servants or slaves to be a thing abso­ <lb/>
            lutely and wholly contrary to nature, for nature has created all <lb/>
            men free, but the injustice and covetousness of some men who <lb/>
            prefer inequality, that cause of all evil, having subdued some, <lb/>
            has given to the more powerful authority over those who are <lb/>
            weaker.</p>
          <p>Accordingly in this sacred entertainment there is, as I have <lb/>
            said, no slave, but free men minister to the guests, perform­ <lb/>
            ing the offices of servants, not under compulsion, nor in <lb/>
            obedience to any imperious commands, but of their own <lb/>
            voluntary free will, with all eagerness and promptitude anti­ <lb/>
            cipating all orders, for they are not any chance free men who <lb/>
            are appointed to perform these duties, but young men who are <lb/>
            selected from their order with all possible care on account of <lb/>
            their excellence, acting as virtuous and well-born youths ought <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            to act who are eager to attain to the perfection of virtue, and <lb/>
            who, like legitimate sons, with affectionate rivalry minister to <lb/>
            their fathers and mothers, thinking their common parents <lb/>
            more closely connected with them than those who are related <lb/>
            by blood, since in truth to men of right principles there is <lb/>
            nothing more nearly akin than virtue; and they come in to <lb/>
            perform their service ungirdled, and with their tunics let <lb/>
            down, in order that nothing which bears any resemblance to a <lb/>
            slavish appearance may be introduced into this festival</p>
          <p>I know well that some persons will laugh when they hear <lb/>
            this, but they who laugh will be those who do things worthy of <lb/>
            weeping and lamentation. And in those days wine is not in­ <lb/>
            troduced, but only the clearest water; cold water for the gene­ <lb/>
            rality, and hot water for those old men who are accustomed to <lb/>
            a luxurious life. And the table, too, bears nothing which has <lb/>
            blood, but there is placed upon it bread for food and salt for <lb/>
            seasoning, to which also hyssop is sometimes added as all extra <lb/>
            sauce for the sake of those who are delicate in their eating, for <lb/>
            just as right reason commands the priest to offer up sober <lb/>
            sacrifices, so also these men are commanded to live sober lives, <lb/>
            for wine is the medicine of folly, and costly seasonings and <lb/>
            sauces excite desire, which is the most insatiable of all beasts.</p>
          <p>X. These, then, are the first circumstances of the feast; <lb/>
            but after the guests have sat down to the table in the order <lb/>
            which I have been describing, and when those who minister to <lb/>
            them are all standing around in order, ready to wait upon <lb/>
            them, and when there is nothing to drink, some one will say <lb/>
            .... but even more so than before, so that no one ventures <lb/>
            to mutter, or even to breathe at all hard, and then some one <lb/>
            looks out some passage in the sacred scriptures, or explains <lb/>
            some difficulty which is proposed by some one else, without <lb/>
            any thoughts of display on his own part, for he is not aiming <lb/>
            at reputation for cleverness and eloquence, but is only desirous <lb/>
            to see some points more accurately, and is content when he <lb/>
            has thus seen them himself not to bear ill will to others, who, <lb/>
            even if they did not perceive the truth with equal acuteness, <lb/>
            have at all events an equal desire of learning. And he, indeed, <lb/>
            follows a slower method of instruction, dwelling on and linger­ <lb/>
            ing over his explanations with repetitions, in order to imprint <lb/>
            his conceptions deep in the minds of his hearers, for as the <lb/>
            understanding of his hearers is not able to keep up with the <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> C </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            interpretation of one who goes on fluently, without stopping to <lb/>
            take breath, it gets behind-hand, and fails to comprehend what <lb/>
            is said; but the hearers, fixing their eyes and attention upon <lb/>
            the speaker, remain in one and the same position listening <lb/>
            attentively, indicating their attention and comprehension by <lb/>
            their nods and looks, and the praise which they are inclined <lb/>
            to bestow on the speaker by the cheerfulness and gentle <lb/>
            manner in which they follow him with their eyes and with the <lb/>
            fore-finger of the right hand.</p>
          <p>And the young men who are standing around attend to this <lb/>
            explanation no less than the guests themselves who are sitting <lb/>
            at meat. And these explanations of the sacred scriptures are <lb/>
            delivered by mystic expressions in allegories, for the whole of <lb/>
            the law appears to these men to resemble a living animal, and <lb/>
            its express commandments seem to be the body, and the <lb/>
            invisible meaning concealed under and lying beneath the, <lb/>
            plain words resembles the soul, in which the rational soul <lb/>
            begins most excellently to contemplate what belongs to itself, <lb/>
            as in a mirror, beholding in these very words the exceeding <lb/>
            beauty of the sentiments, and unfolding and explaining the <lb/>
            symbols, and bringing the secret meaning naked to the light <lb/>
            to all who are able by the light of a slight intimation to per­ <lb/>
            ceive what is unseen by what is visible.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, the president appears to have spoken at <lb/>
            sufficient length, and to have carried out his intentions <lb/>
            adequately, so that his explanation has gone on felicitously <lb/>
            and fluently through his own acuteness, and the hearing <lb/>
            of the others has been profitable, applause arises from them <lb/>
            all as of men rejoicing together at what they have seen <lb/>
            and heard; and then some one rising up sings a hymn which <lb/>
            has been made in honour of God, either such as be has com­ <lb/>
            posed himself, or some ancient one of some old poet, for they <lb/>
            have left behind them many poems and songs in trimetre <lb/>
            iambics, and in psalms of thanksgiving and in hymns, and <lb/>
            songs at the time of libation, and at the altar, and in regular <lb/>
            order, and in choruses, admirably measured out in various <lb/>
            and well diversified strophes.</p>
          <p>And after him then others also arise in their ranks, in <lb/>
            becoming order, while every one else listens in decent silence, <lb/>
            except when it is proper for them to take up the burden of the <lb/>
            song, and to join in at the end ; for then they all, both men <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            and women, join in the hymn. And when each individual <lb/>
            has finished his psalm, then the young men bring in the table <lb/>
            which was mentioned a little while ago, on which was placed <lb/>
            that most holy food, the leavened bread, with a seasoning of <lb/>
            salt, with which hyssop is mingled, out of reverence for the <lb/>
            sacred table, which lies thus in the holy outer temple; for on <lb/>
            this table are placed loaves and salt without seasoning, and <lb/>
            the bread is unleavened, and the salt unmixed with anything <lb/>
            else, for it was becoming that the simplest and purest things <lb/>
            should be allotted to the most excellent portion of the priests, <lb/>
            as a reward for their ministrations, and that the others should <lb/>
            admire similar things, but should abstain from the loaves, in <lb/>
            order that those who are the more excellent persons may have <lb/>
            the precedence.</p>
          <p>XI. And after the feast they celebrate the sacred festival <lb/>
            during the whole night; and this nocturnal festival is celebrated <lb/>
            in the following manner: they all stand up together, and in <lb/>
            the middle of the entertainment two choruses are formed at <lb/>
            first, the one of men and the other of women, and for each <lb/>
            chorus there is a leader and chief selected, who is the most <lb/>
            honourable and most excellent of the band. Then they sing <lb/>
            hymns which have been composed in honour of God in many <lb/>
            metres and tunes, at one time all singing together, and at <lb/>
            another moving their hands and dancing in corresponding <lb/>
            harmony, and uttering in an inspired manner songs of thanks­ <lb/>
            giving, and at another time regular odes, and performing all <lb/>
            necessary strophes and antistrophes.</p>
          <p>Then, when each chorus of the men and each chorus of the <lb/>
            women has feasted separately by itself, like persons in the <lb/>
            bacchanalian revels, drinking the pure wine of the love of <lb/>
            God, they join together, and the two become one chorus, an <lb/>
            imitation of that one which, in old time, was established by <lb/>
            the Red Sea, on account of the wondrous works which' were <lb/>
            displayed there; for, by the commandment of God, the sea <lb/>
            became to one party the cause of safety, and to the other <lb/>
            that of utter destruction; for it being burst asunder, and <lb/>
            dragged back by a violent reflux, and being built up on each <lb/>
            side as if there were a solid wall, the space in the midst was <lb/>
            widened, and cut into a level and dry road, along which the <lb/>
            people passed over to the opposite land, being conducted <lb/>
            onwards to higher ground; then, when the sea returned and <note type="footnote"> C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            ran back to its former channel, and was poured out from both <lb/>
            sides, on what had just before been dry ground, those of the <lb/>
            enemy who pursued were overwhelmed and perished.</p>
          <p>When the Israelites saw and experienced this great miracle, <lb/>
            which was an event beyond all description, beyond all imagi­ <lb/>
            nation, and beyond all hope, both men and women together, <lb/>
            under the influence of divine inspiration, becoming all one <lb/>
            chorus, sang hymns of thanksgiving to God the Saviour, <lb/>
            Moses the prophet leading the men, and Miriam the prophet­ <lb/>
            ess leading the women.</p>
          <p>Now the chorus of male and female worshippers being <lb/>
            formed, as far as possible on this model, makes a most humor­ <lb/>
            ous concert, and a truly musical symphony, the shrill voices <lb/>
            of the women mingling with the deep-toned voices of the men. <lb/>
            The ideas were beautiful, the expressions beautiful, and the <lb/>
            chorus-singers were beautiful; and the end of ideas, and <lb/>
            expressions, and chorus-singers, was piety; therefore, being <lb/>
            intoxicated all night till the morning with this beautiful in­ <lb/>
            toxication, without feeling their heads heavy or closing their <lb/>
            eyes for sleep, but being even more awake than when they <lb/>
            came to the feast, as to their eyes and their whole bodies, and <lb/>
            standing there till morning, when they saw the sun rising they <lb/>
            raised their hands to heaven, imploring tranquillity and truth, <lb/>
            and acuteness of understanding.</p>
          <p>And after their prayers they each retired to their own sepa­ <lb/>
            rate abodes, with the intention of again practising the usual <lb/>
            philosophy to which they had been wont to devote themselves.</p>
          <p>This then is what I have to say of those who are called <lb/>
            therapeutæ, who have devoted themselves to the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of nature, and who have lived in it and in the soul alone, <lb/>
            being citizens of heaven and of the world, and very acceptable <lb/>
            to the Father and Creator of the universe because of their vir­ <lb/>
            tue, which has procured them his love as their most appro­ <lb/>
            priate reward, which far surpasses all the gifts of fortune, and <lb/>
            conducts them to the very summit and perfection of happiness.</p><pb n="21"/>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE INCORRUPTIBILITY OF THE WORLD.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. IN every uncertain and important business it is proper to <lb/>
            invoke God, because he is the good Creator of the world, and <lb/>
            because nothing is uncertain with him who is possessed of the <lb/>
            most accurate knowledge of all things. But of all times it is <lb/>
            most necessary to invoke him when one is preparing to discuss <lb/>
            the incorruptibility of the world; for neither among the things <lb/>
            which are visible to the outward senses is there anything more <lb/>
            admirably complete than the world, nor among things appreci­ <lb/>
            able by the intellect is there anything more perfect than God. <lb/>
            But the mind is at all times the governor of the outward <lb/>
            sense, and that which is appreciable by the intellect is at all <lb/>
            times superior to that which is visible to the outward senses, <lb/>
            but those persons in whom there is implanted a vigorous and <lb/>
            earnest love of truth willingly undergo the trouble of making <lb/>
            inquiries relative to the subordinate things, from that which is <lb/>
            superior to and the ruler over them.</p>
          <p>If then, we, who have been practised and trained in all the <lb/>
            doctrines of prudence, and temperance, and virtue, have <lb/>
            discarded all the stains of the passions and diseases, perhaps <lb/>
            God would not disdain to give to souls completely purified and <lb/>
            cleansed, so as to appear in his image, a knowledge of heavenly <lb/>
            things either by means of dreams, or of oracles, or of signs, or <lb/>
            of wonders. But since we have on us the marks of folly, and <lb/>
            injustice, and of all other vices strongly stamped upon us and <lb/>
            difficult to be effaced, we must be content even if we are only <lb/>
            able by them to discover some faint copy and imitation of the <lb/>
            truth. It is right, therefore, for those who are investigating <lb/>
            the question whether the world is perishable, since the two <lb/>
            words, "corruption," and " the world," will be in continual use, <lb/>
            first of all to investigate the precise meaning of both expres­ <lb/>
            sions, in order that we may know what is now signified, and <lb/>
            what has been ordained. And we must enumerate, not indeed <lb/>
            everything which is signified by those words, but so much as is <lb/>
            useful for the purpose of our present instruction.</p>
          <p>II. The world, therefore, is spoken of in its primary sense <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            as a single system, consisting of the heaven and the stars in <lb/>
            the circumference of the earth, and all the animals and plants <lb/>
            which are upon it; and in another sense it is spoken of merely <lb/>
            as the heaven. And Anaxagoras, having a regard to this fact, <lb/>
            once made answer to a certain person who asked of him what <lb/>
            the reason was why he generally endeavoured to pass the <lb/>
            night in the open air, that he did so for the sake of beholding <lb/>
            the world, by which expression he meant the motions and <lb/>
            revolutions of the stars.</p>
          <p>And in its third meaning, as the Stoics affirm, it is a certain <lb/>
            admirably-arranged essence, extending to the period of confla­ <lb/>
            gration, either beautifully adorned or unadorned, the periods <lb/>
            of the motion of which are called time.</p>
          <p>But at present the subject of our consideration is the world, <lb/>
            taken in the first sense of the word, which being one only, <lb/>
            consists of the heaven, and of the earth, and of all that is <lb/>
            therein. And the term corruption is used to signify a change <lb/>
            for the worse; it is also used to signify the utter destruction of <lb/>
            that which exists, a destruction so complete as to have no <lb/>
            existence at all; for as nothing is generated out of nothing, so <lb/>
            neither can anything which exists be destroyed so as to become <lb/>
            non-existence.* For it is impossible that anything should be <lb/>
            generated of that which has no existence anywhere, and equally <lb/>
            so that what does exist should be so utterly destroyed as never <lb/>
            to be mentioned or heard of again. And indeed in this spirit <lb/>
            the tragedian says :— <lb/>
            " Nought that e'er has been <lb/>
            Completely dies, but things combined <lb/>
            Before another union find; <lb/>
            Quitting their former company, <lb/>
            And so again in other forms are seen,"☨ <lb/>
            Nor is it so very silly a thing to doubt whether the world is <lb/>
            destroyed so as to pass into a state of non-existence, but rather <lb/>
            whether it is subjected to a change from a new arrangement, <lb/>
            being dissolved as to all the manifold forms of its elements and <lb/>
            combinations so as to assume one and the same appearance, or <lb/>
            whether, like a thing broken and dashed to pieces, it is <lb/>
            subjected to a complete confusion of its different fragments. <note type="footnote"> * This is similar to Lucretius's doctrine- <lb/>
            Nil igitur fieri de nihilo posse putandum est. </note><note type="footnote"> ☨ From the Chrysippus of Euripides. </note> <pb n="23"/>
            </p>
          <p>III. And there are three different opinions on the subject <lb/>
            which we are at present discussing. Since some persons <lb/>
            affirm that the world is eternal, and uncreated, and not liable <lb/>
            to any destruction; while others, on the contrary, say that it <lb/>
            has been created and is destructible. There are also others <lb/>
            who take a portion of each of these two opinions, agreeing with <lb/>
            the last-mentioned sect that it has been created, but with the <lb/>
            former class that it is indestructible; and thus they have left <lb/>
            behind them a mixed opinion, thinking that it is at the same <lb/>
            time created and imperishable.</p>
          <p>However, Democritus and Epicurus, and the principal <lb/>
            number of the Stoic philosophers, affirm both the creation and <lb/>
            the destructibility of the world, though they do not all speak <lb/>
            in similar senses; for some give a sketch of many worlds, the <lb/>
            generation of which they attribute to the concourse and combi­ <lb/>
            nation of atoms, and their destruction they impute to the <lb/>
            dissolution and breaking up of the combined particles.</p>
          <p>But the Stoics speak of one world only, and affirm that <lb/>
            God is the cause of its creation, but that the cause of its cor­ <lb/>
            ruption is no longer God, but the power of invincible, un­ <lb/>
            wearied fire, which pervades all existing things, in the long <lb/>
            periods of time dissolving everything into itself, while from it <lb/>
            again a regeneration of the world takes place through the <lb/>
            providence of the Creator. And according to these men there <lb/>
            may be one world spoken of as eternal and another as destruc­ <lb/>
            tible, destructible in reference to its present arrangement, and <lb/>
            eternal as to the conflagration which takes place, since it is <lb/>
            rendered immortal by regenerations and periodical revolutions <lb/>
            which never cease.</p>
          <p>But Aristotle, with a knowledge as to which I know not to <lb/>
            what degree I may call it holy and pious, affirmed that the <lb/>
            world was uncreated and indestructible, and he accused those <lb/>
            who maintained a contrary opinion of terrible impiety, for <lb/>
            thinking that so great a visible God was in no respect different <lb/>
            from things made with hands, though he contains within him­ <lb/>
            self the sun, and the moon, and all the rest of the planets <lb/>
            and fixed stars, and, in fact, the whole of the divine nature; <lb/>
            and he said in a cavilling and reproachful tone, that formerly <lb/>
            he had feared for his house lest it should be overthrown by <lb/>
            violent gales, or extraordinary storms, or by lapse of time, or <lb/>
            through the want of the proper care requisite to preserve it, <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            but that now he had a much greater fear hanging over him In <lb/>
            consequence of those men who by their reasonings went to <lb/>
            destroy the whole world. But some say that it was not <lb/>
            Aristotle who invented this doctrine, but some of the Py­ <lb/>
            thagoreans; but I have met with a work of Ocellus, a Luca­ <lb/>
            nian by birth, entitled, " A Treatise on the Nature of the <lb/>
            Universe," in which he has not only asserted that the world is <lb/>
            indestructible, but he has even endeavoured to prove it so by <lb/>
            demonstrative proofs.</p>
          <p>IV. But some say that the world has been proved by Plato <lb/>
            in the Timæus to be both uncreated and indestructible, in the <lb/>
            account of that divine assembly in which the younger gods are <lb/>
            addressed by the eldest and the governor of them all in the <lb/>
            following terms ;* " 0 ye gods of gods, those works of which <lb/>
            I am the father and the creator are indissoluble as long as I <lb/>
            choose that they shall be so. Now everything which has been <lb/>
            bound together is capable of being dissolved, but it is the part <lb/>
            of an evil ruler to dissolve that which has been well combined <lb/>
            and arranged, and which is in good condition. Wherefore, <lb/>
            since you also have been created, you are not of necessity <lb/>
            immortal or utterly indissoluble; nevertheless you shall not <lb/>
            be dissolved, nor shall you be exposed to the fate of death, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as you have my will to keep you united, which is a <lb/>
            still greater and more powerful bond than those by which you <lb/>
            were bound together when you were first created."</p>
          <p>But some persons interpret Plato's words sophistically, and <lb/>
            think that he affirms that the world was created, not inas­ <lb/>
            much as it has had a beginning of creation, but inasmuch as <lb/>
            if it had been. created it could not possibly have existed in any <lb/>
            other manner than that in which it actually does exist as has <lb/>
            been described, or else because it is in its creation arid change <lb/>
            that the parts are seen. But the forementioned opinion is <lb/>
            better and truer, not only because throughout the whole <lb/>
            treatise he affirms that the Creator of the gods is also the father <lb/>
            and creator and maker of everything, and that the world is a <lb/>
            most beautiful work of his and his offspring, being an imita­ <lb/>
            tion visible to the outward senses of an archetypal model <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, comprehending in itself as <lb/>
            many objects of the outward senses as the model does objects <note type="footnote"> * Timæus, p. 40. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            of the intellect, since it is a most perfect impression of a <lb/>
            most perfect model, and is addressed to the outward sense as <lb/>
            the other is to the intellect.*</p>
          <p>But also because Aristotle bears witness to this fact in the <lb/>
            case of Plato, who, from his great reverence for philosophy, <lb/>
            would never have spoken falsely, and also because no one can <lb/>
            possibly be more to be credited in the case of a teacher than <lb/>
            his pupil, especially when the pupil is such a man as this who <lb/>
            did not apply himself to instruction lightly with an indifference <lb/>
            easily satisfied, but who even endeavoured to surpass all the <lb/>
            discoveries of former men, and did actually devise some novel­ <lb/>
            ties and enrich every part of philosophy with some most <lb/>
            important discoveries.</p>
          <p>V. But some persons think that the father of the Platonic <lb/>
            theory was the poet Hesiod, as they conceive that the world is <lb/>
            spoken of by him as created and indestructible; as created, <lb/>
            when he says,­ <lb/>
            "First did Chaos rule; <lb/>
            Then the broad-chested earth was brought to light, <lb/>
            Foundation firm and lasting for whatever <lb/>
            Exists among mankind ;"t <lb/>
            and as indestructible, because he has given no hint of its dis­ <lb/>
            solution or destruction.</p>
          <p>Now Chaos was conceived by Aristotle to be a place, because <lb/>
            it is absolutely necessary that a place to receive them must be <lb/>
            in existence before bodies. But some of the Stoics think that <lb/>
            it is water, imagining that its name has been derived from <lb/>
            effusion. But however that may be, it is exceedingly plain <lb/>
            that the world is spoken of by Hesiod as having been created: <lb/>
            and a very long time before him Moses, the lawgiver of the <lb/>
            Jews, had said in his sacred volumes that the world was both <lb/>
            created and indestructible, and the number of the books is five. <lb/>
            The first of which he entitled Genesis, in which he begins in <lb/>
            the following manner: " In the beginning God created the <lb/>
            heaven and the earth ; and the earth was invisible and without <lb/>
            form." Then proceeding onwards he relates in the following <lb/>
            verses, that days and nights, and seasons, and years, and the <lb/>
            sun and moon, which showed the nature of the measurement <note type="footnote"> * There is probably some corruption in the text here, </note><note type="footnote"> ☨ Hesiod, Theogon 116. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χύσις</foreign>, as if chaos were derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χέω</foreign>, " to pour." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="26"/>
            of time, were created, which, having received an immortal <lb/>
            portion in common with the whole heaven, continue for ever <lb/>
            indestructible.</p>
          <p>But we must place those arguments first which make out <lb/>
            the world to be uncreated and indestructible, because of our <lb/>
            respect for that which is visible, employing an appropriate <lb/>
            commencement. To all things which are liable to destruction <lb/>
            there are two causes of that destruction, one being internal <lb/>
            and the other external: therefore you may find iron, and <lb/>
            brass, and all other substances of that kind destroyed by <lb/>
            themselves when rust, like a creeping disease, overruns and <lb/>
            devours them; and by external causes when, if a house or a <lb/>
            city is burnt, they also are consumed in the conflagration, <lb/>
            being melted by the violent impetuosity of the fire.</p>
          <p>A similar end also befalls animals, partly when they are <lb/>
            sick of diseases arising internally, and partly when they are <lb/>
            destroyed by external causes, being sacrificed, or stoned, or <lb/>
            burnt, or when they endure an unclean death by hanging.</p>
          <p>And if the world also is destroyed, then it must of necessity <lb/>
            be so either by some external cause, or else by some one of <lb/>
            the powers which exist within itself; and both these alter <lb/>
            natives are impossible, for there is nothing whatever outside of <lb/>
            the world, since all things are brought together in order to <lb/>
            make it complete and full, for it is in this way that it will be <lb/>
            one, and whole, and free from old age ; it will be one, because <lb/>
            if anything were left outside of it, then another world might <lb/>
            be created resembling that which exists now; and whole, <lb/>
            because the whole of its essence is expended on itself; and <lb/>
            exempt from old age and from all disease, since those bodies <lb/>
            which are liable to be destroyed by disease or old age are <lb/>
            violently overthrown by external causes, such as heat, and <lb/>
            cold, and other contrary qualities, no power of which is able to <lb/>
            escape so as to surround and attack the world, all those being <lb/>
            entirely enclosed within, without any part whatever being <lb/>
            separated from the rest.</p>
          <p>But if indeed there is any external thing it must by all <lb/>
            means be a vacuum, or else a nature absolutely impossible, <lb/>
            which it would be impossible should either suffer or do any­ <lb/>
            thing. And again, it will also not be dissolved by any <lb/>
            cause existing within itself; first of all because, if it were, <lb/>
            then the part would be greater and more powerful than the <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            whole, which is the greatest possible absurdity, for the world, <lb/>
            enjoying an unsurpassable power, influences all its parts, and <lb/>
            is not itself influenced or moved by any one of them; in the <lb/>
            second place because, since there are two causes of corruption, <lb/>
            the one being internal and the other external, those things <lb/>
            which are competent to admit the one must also by all means <lb/>
            be liable to the other; and a proof of this may be found in <lb/>
            oxen, and horses, and men, and other animals of similar kinds, <lb/>
            because it is their nature to be destroyed by the sword, or to <lb/>
            be liable to die by disease; for it is difficult, or I might rather <lb/>
            say impossible, to find anything which, being by nature at the <lb/>
            mercy of some external cause perceptible by the intellect, will <lb/>
            still not be liable to corruption ... by itself when the world <lb/>
            was not.</p>
          <p>For that which has no existence is not put in motion, but it <lb/>
            has been shown already that time is an interval of the motion <lb/>
            of the world. It follows, therefore, of necessity, that each of <lb/>
            these things must have subsisted from all eternity, without <lb/>
            receiving any beginning of generation, and being in conse­ <lb/>
            quence not liable to any corruption. Perhaps some quibbling <lb/>
            Stoic will say that time is admitted to be an interval of the <lb/>
            motion of the world, but not of that world only which is <lb/>
            arranged and adorned by itself, but also of that one which is <lb/>
            conceived of in connection with the conflagration which has <lb/>
            been spoken of; to whom we must reply,—"My good man. <lb/>
            you, misapplying words, call what is disorderliness and a want <lb/>
            of arrangement order (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰόσμος</foreign>), for if this thing which we see <lb/>
            is correctly and appropriately called the world (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰόσμς</foreign>), * <lb/>
            being arranged and adorned (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰςϰοσμημένος</foreign>) as we see it by <lb/>
            man, by the perfection of his skill, then any one would bo <lb/>
            surely correct in calling the change which is wrought in it by <lb/>
            fire a want of order."</p>
          <p>VI. But Critolaus, a man who devoted himself very much <lb/>
            to literature, and a lover of the Peripatetic philosophy, agree­ <lb/>
            ing with the doctrine of the eternity of the world, used the <lb/>
            following arguments to prove it: "If the world was created, <lb/>
            then it follows of necessity that the earth was created also; and <lb/>
            if the earth was created, then beyond all question the human <lb/>
            race was so too. But man was not created, since he subsists <note type="footnote"> * Philo is playing here on the two meanings of the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">Κόσμυς</foreign>, <lb/>
            which signifies both " order " and " the world." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            of an everlasting race, as shall be proved, therefore the world <lb/>
            is eternal."</p>
          <p>But I must now proceed to examine the argument which I <lb/>
            postponed just now, if indeed things that are so evident stand <lb/>
            in need of any demonstration; but, indeed, proofs are neces­ <lb/>
            sary on account of the inventors of fables who, filling all life <lb/>
            with their falsehoods, have utterly driven truth out of the <lb/>
            land, and have not merely banished it from cities and houses, <lb/>
            but have even deprived each separate individual of that most <lb/>
            valuable possession, and, for the purpose of alluring his sight, <lb/>
            have invented metres and rhythm as a bait and a snare, by <lb/>
            which they cajole the ears of fools, just as ugly and shapeless <lb/>
            courtesans allure the eyes by necklaces and spurious ornaments <lb/>
            in the absence of all genuine beauty, for they say that the genera­ <lb/>
            tion of mankind by means of one another is a more recent work <lb/>
            of nature, but that the more original and ancient mode of their <lb/>
            birth is out of the earth, since she both is and is considered <lb/>
            the mother of all men. And they say that those men who are <lb/>
            celebrated among the Greeks as having sprung from seed were <lb/>
            produced and grew up as trees do now, being perfect and com­ <lb/>
            pletely armed sons of the earth. But that this is a mere <lb/>
            fiction of fable it is easy to see from many circumstances.</p>
          <p>For the very moment that the first man was born there was <lb/>
            a necessity for his receiving growth in accordance with the <lb/>
            previously defined measures and numbers of time, for nature <lb/>
            has arranged the different ages as certain steps along which <lb/>
            man in a manner ascends and descends; he ascends while he <lb/>
            is growing, and he descends at the period when he is lessen­ <lb/>
            ing ; and the boundary of the uppermost steps is the prime <lb/>
            of life at which when a man has arrived he no longer makes <lb/>
            any further advance ; but as runners who run the diaulos turn <lb/>
            back again upon the same path which they have already <lb/>
            travelled, so too does man retrace his steps, giving back in the <lb/>
            weakness of old age what he has received from vigorous youth ; <lb/>
            but to fancy that any one has ever been born absolutely perfect <lb/>
            is the part of those who are ignorant of the laws of nature, <lb/>
            which are unchangeable ordinances.</p>
          <p>For our minds, being vitiated by the contagion of the mortal <lb/>
            body which is united to them, are very naturally liable to <lb/>
            changes and alterations, but the works of the nature of the <lb/>
            universe are unalterable, since she has dominion over all <lb/>
             <pb n="29"/>
            things, and by means of the stability of whatever desires she <lb/>
            has once established she preserves the definitions which have <lb/>
            been originally fixed in an unchangeable state. If then she <lb/>
            had originally thought it proper that men should be born <lb/>
            perfect, now also man would still be born in a perfect state, <lb/>
            without ever being an infant, or a boy, or a youth, but he <lb/>
            would at once be a man, and perhaps he would be altogether <lb/>
            exempt from old age and from death, for that thing which has <lb/>
            no increase must also of necessity be exempt from all diminu­ <lb/>
            tion, for up to the prime of a man's life all his changes tend <lb/>
            towards increase, but from that period up to old age and death <lb/>
            they exist with a gradual diminution; and it is natural to <lb/>
            suppose that he who has no share in the former must also be <lb/>
            free from the subsequent changes.</p>
          <p>And what is there that can hinder men from shooting up <lb/>
            now out of the ground like plants, as they say that they did in <lb/>
            former times ? For the earth has not yet grown old so as to <lb/>
            appear to have become barren by reason of the lapse of time, <lb/>
            but it remains in the same condition as before, being always <lb/>
            young, because it is a fourth part of the universe, and for the <lb/>
            sake of ensuring the duration of the universe it is bound not <lb/>
            to decay, because its kindred elements, water, air, and fire, <lb/>
            all remain for ever exempt from old age. And there is a <lb/>
            visible proof of the uninterrupted and everlasting vigour of <lb/>
            the earth in the plants which spring from it, for being purified, <lb/>
            either by the overflowing of rivers, as they say that Egypt is, <lb/>
            or by annual rains, by such irrigation it refreshes and recruits <lb/>
            its exhausted powers, and then, having rested for a while, it <lb/>
            recovers its natural powers to the full extent of its original <lb/>
            vigour, and then it begins again with a repetition of the pro­ <lb/>
            duction of similar things to those which it produced before to <lb/>
            supply abundant food to every description of animal.</p>
          <p>VII. In reference to which fact it appears to me that the <lb/>
            poets were very felicitous in the appellation which they gave <lb/>
            to the earth when they called it Pandora, inasmuch as it gives <lb/>
            all things,<note>πάντα δωρουμένην.</note> both such as are required for use and such as <lb/>
            serve to pleasure and to enjoyment, and that not to some only <lb/>
            but to all animals which enjoy life. Accordingly, if any one, <lb/>
            when the spring was in its prime, should be borne on wings <lb/>
            and raised aloft, and look down from his height upon the  <lb/>
               <pb n="30"/>
              mountain and champaign country, and see the one abounding <lb/>
              in rich grass, and verdant, producing herbage, and fodder, and <lb/>
              barley, and wheat, and innumerable other kinds of crops such <lb/>
              as are grown from seed which the husbandmen have strown, <lb/>
              and which the season of the year affords of its own accord, <lb/>
              and the other overshadowed with branches and leaves by <lb/>
              which the trees are adorned, and very full of fruits (not only <lb/>
              such as are suitable for food, but also of such as are able to <lb/>
              heal suffering, for the fruit of the olive relieves the fatigue of the <lb/>
              body, and that of the vine, when drunk in moderation, relaxes <lb/>
              the excessive pains of the soul), and rich also in the fragrant <lb/>
              airs which are borne around from flowers, and the indescriba­ <lb/>
              ble peculiarities of the various flowers which are diversified <lb/>
              by divine skill.</p>
          <p>And then, if he turns aside his eyes from those trees which <lb/>
            admit of cultivation, and beholds in their turn poplars, and <lb/>
            cedars, and pines, and ashes, and the lofty oaks, and the dense <lb/>
            and unceasing masses of all the other wild trees which over­ <lb/>
            shadow the most numerous and the greatest of the mountains, <lb/>
            and the greater part of the border country wherever there is <lb/>
            any deep soil, he will then know that the vigour of the earth, <lb/>
            which is always young, is unremitting, unsubdued, and un­ <lb/>
            wearied.</p>
          <p>So that since it is in no degree deprived of any portion of <lb/>
            its former strength, if it had ever done so before, it would be <lb/>
            bringing forth men now also, for two most forcible reasons, <lb/>
            one in order that it might not quit the classification belonging <lb/>
            to it, especially in the sowing and production of that most <lb/>
            excellent of all the creatures which dwell upon the earth, the <lb/>
            ruler of all, man, and secondly for the sake of giving assist­ <lb/>
            ance to women, who after they have conceived are for about <lb/>
            ten months weighed down with the most severe pains, and <lb/>
            when they are about to bring forth do very often die in the <lb/>
            very pains of labour.</p>
          <p>Is it not then altogether a terrible piece of stupidity to imagine <lb/>
            that the earth contains any womb calculated for the production <lb/>
            of men ? for the womb is the place which vivifies the animal, <lb/>
            being as some one has called it the workshop of nature, in <lb/>
            which it fashions nothing but animals; but it is not a portion <lb/>
            of the earth, but of a female animal, carefully fashioned so <lb/>
            as to be adapted for the production of living creatures, since <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            otherwise it would be necessary for us to attribute breasts <lb/>
            to the earth as to a woman, when it produces men and they <lb/>
            are born, so that when first born they may have appropriate <lb/>
            food.</p>
          <p>But there is no river nor fountain in the whole habitable <lb/>
            world which is said ever to have produced milk instead of <lb/>
            water; and in addition to this, as it is necessary that a child <lb/>
            just born must be fed on milk, so also must he avail himself <lb/>
            of the protection of clothing on account of the injury which <lb/>
            ensues from cold or heat to children while they are being <lb/>
            reared, on which account nurses and mothers, to whom the <lb/>
            care of infants when just born is of necessity committed, <lb/>
            wrap them up in swaddling clothes ; but if they were produced <lb/>
            out of the earth, how would it be possible that, being left com­ <lb/>
            pletely naked, they would not be at once destroyed either by <lb/>
            the coldness of the air on the one hand, or the burning heat <lb/>
            of the sun on the other ? for when great cold or great heat <lb/>
            gets the mastery, it produces diseases and corruptions.</p>
          <p>But after the inventors of fables once began to neglect the <lb/>
            truth they then ventured to add to their monstrous stories the <lb/>
            fiction that those men who sprung from seed were born also in <lb/>
            complete armour; for what smith, or what new Vulcan, was <lb/>
            there under the earth so skilful as in a moment to prepare so <lb/>
            many suits of armour? and what experience had creatures <lb/>
            just born to enable them to use their weapons? for man is a <lb/>
            very peaceful animal, nature having given to him reason <lb/>
            as his especial honour, by means of which he charms and <lb/>
            tames the savage passions. It would have been much better <lb/>
            instead of arms to give him a herald's wand, a symbol of <lb/>
            agreement and peace suitable to a reasonable nature, in order <lb/>
            that he might so proclaim peace instead of war to all men <lb/>
            everywhere.</p>
          <p>VIlI. We have now then discussed at sufficient length the <lb/>
            nonsense in opposition to truth which is uttered by those who <lb/>
            build up falsehood and fables. But we must be well assured <lb/>
            that men have from all eternity sprung from other men in <lb/>
            constant succession, the man implanting the seed in the <lb/>
            woman as in a field, and the woman receiving the seed so as to <lb/>
            preserve it, and nature by her unseen operations fashioning <lb/>
            everything, and each separate part of the body and of the <lb/>
            soul, and giving to the whole race of mankind that which each <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            individual separately is unable to receive, namely, the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of immortality ; for though the individual members are <lb/>
            continually perishing, yet the race remains undying as a truly <lb/>
            divine work. But if man, who is but a small portion of the <lb/>
            universe, is eternal, then certainly the world itself must have <lb/>
            been uncreated so as to be imperishable.</p>
          <p>IX. But Critolaus, in arguing in support of his opinion, <lb/>
            brought forward an argument of this kind,-" That which is <lb/>
            the cause to man of his being in health is itself free from <lb/>
            disease, and, in like manner, the cause of his keeping awake <lb/>
            must itself be sleepless ; and if this is the case, that which is <lb/>
            the cause of his existing for ever must itself also be everlast­ <lb/>
            ing." Now the cause of man's existing for ever is the world, <lb/>
            since it is so to all other things whatever; therefore the world <lb/>
            also is immortal. Nevertheless, this point also is worthy of <lb/>
            one consideration: that everything which is born must by all <lb/>
            means at the beginning be imperfect, but as time advances he <lb/>
            must increase till he arrives at complete perfection, so that if <lb/>
            the world was born it was at one time (that I may use the ex­ <lb/>
            pressions appropriate to the ages of men) a mere infant, and <lb/>
            subsequently increasing in periods of years and lapse of time, <lb/>
            it at last and with great difficulty arrived at perfection, for of <lb/>
            necessity the period at which that which of all things has the <lb/>
            longest existence must be late.</p>
          <p>But if any one fancies that the world has ever really been <lb/>
            subjected to such changes as these, it is time that lie should <lb/>
            learn that he has been under the influence of incurable mad­ <lb/>
            ness, for it is plain that if that is the case not only will its <lb/>
            bodily appearance be increased, but its mind also will receive <lb/>
            growth, since they who attribute liability to perish to it con­ <lb/>
            ceive it to be a rational creature. Therefore, just like a man, <lb/>
            it will be devoid of reason at the commencement of its exist­ <lb/>
            ence, but endowed with reason at the age when it is in its <lb/>
            prime, which it is impious not only to say, but even to think, <lb/>
            for how can we imagine the most perfect visible circumference <lb/>
            which surrounds us, and which contains within itself so many <lb/>
            individual inhabitants, is not always perfect both in soul and <lb/>
            body, being exempt from all those evils in which everything <lb/>
            which has been born and which is perishable is implicated ?</p>
          <p>X. And in addition to this he says, that there are three <lb/>
            causes of death to living animals, besides the external causes <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            which may affect them, namely, disease, old age, and want, <lb/>
            by no one of which is the world liable to be attacked or sub­ <lb/>
            dued, for that it is composed of entire elements, since there is <lb/>
            no part of them which is left out or which remains at liberty, <lb/>
            so that any violence can be offered to it, and it also is superior <lb/>
            to those powers from which diseases arise; and they yielding <lb/>
            keep the world free from all disease, and free from old age, <lb/>
            and in a state of the most perfect self-sufficiency as to all its <lb/>
            requirements, and without need of anything, since, there is <lb/>
            nothing wanting to it which can possibly contribute to its <lb/>
            durability, and wholly exempt from all successions and alter­ <lb/>
            nations of fulness and emptiness, which animals being subject <lb/>
            to by reason of their unregulated insatiability, bring upon <lb/>
            themselves death instead of life, or, to speak more accurately, <lb/>
            a life which is more pitiable than any destruction.</p>
          <p>Moreover, if we saw that there was no such thing as any <lb/>
            eternal nature to be seen, those who assert the liability of the <lb/>
            world to destruction would not appear to be so guilty of dis­ <lb/>
            paraging the world without any excuse, since they would have <lb/>
            no example whatever of anything being everlasting; but since <lb/>
            fate, according to the doctrine of those who have investigated <lb/>
            the principles of natural philosophy most accurately, is a thing <lb/>
            without any beginning and without any end, connecting all <lb/>
            the causes of everything, as to leave no break and no interrup­ <lb/>
            tion, why may we not in like manner also affirm of the nature <lb/>
            of the world that it subsists for a great length of time, being. <lb/>
            as it were, an arrangement of what is otherwise in no order, <lb/>
            a harmony of what is otherwise wholly destitute of such har­ <lb/>
            mony, an agreement of what is otherwise without agreement, <lb/>
            a union of things previously separated, a condition of stocks <lb/>
            and stones, a nature of things growing from seed and of trees, <lb/>
            a life of all animals, the mind and reason of men, and the <lb/>
            most perfect virtue of virtuous men ?</p>
          <p>But if the nature of the world is uncreated and indestruc­ <lb/>
            tible, then it is plain that the world is held together and <lb/>
            powerfully preserved by an everlasting indissoluble chain. <lb/>
            But some of those who used to hold a different opinion, being <lb/>
            overpowered by truth, have changed their doctrine ; for beauty <lb/>
            has a power which is very attractive, and the truth is beyond <lb/>
            all things beautiful, as falsehood on the contrary is enormously <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            ugly; therefore Boethus, and Posidonius, and Panætius, men <lb/>
            of great learning in the Stoic doctrines, as if seized with a <lb/>
            sudden inspiration, abandoning all the stories about conflagra­ <lb/>
            tions and regeneration, have come over to the more divine <lb/>
            doctrine of the incorruptibility of the world; and it is said <lb/>
            also that Diogenes, when he was very young, agreed entirely <lb/>
            with those authors.......</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, the arrangement of the world is such as I <lb/>
            have endeavoured to describe it, so that there is no part what­ <lb/>
            ever left out, so as for any force to be applied, it has now been <lb/>
            proved that the world will not be destroyed by any external <lb/>
            thing, because in fact nothing whatever external has been left <lb/>
            at all; nor will it be destroyed by anything in itself on account <lb/>
            of the proof which has already been considered and stated, <lb/>
            according to which that which was obnoxious to the power of <lb/>
            one of those causes was also naturally susceptible of the <lb/>
            influence of the other.</p>
          <p>XI. And there are testimonies also in the Timæus to the <lb/>
            fact of the world being exempt from disease and not liable to <lb/>
            destruction, such as these: " Accordingly, of the four ele­ <lb/>
            ments the constitution of the world receives each in all its <lb/>
            integrity; for he who compounded it made it to consist of the <lb/>
            whole of fire, and the whole of water, and the whole of air, <lb/>
            and the whole of earth, not leaving any portion or any power <lb/>
            of any one of them outside, from the following intentions :— <lb/>
            in the first place, in order that the whole might be as far as <lb/>
            possible a perfect animal made up of perfect parts. And <lb/>
            besides all these things, he ordained that it should be one, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as there is nothing left out of which another similar <lb/>
            world could be composed. Moreover, he willed that it should <lb/>
            be exempt from old age, and free from all disease, considering <lb/>
            that those things which in the body are hot or cold, or which <lb/>
            have mighty powers, if standing all around and falling upon <lb/>
            it unseasonably, would be likely to dissolve it, and, by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing diseases and old age, cause it to decay and perish. For <lb/>
            this cause, and because of this reason, God made the whole <lb/>
            universe to consist of entire and perfect elements, and exempt <lb/>
            from old age and free from disease."</p>
          <p>Let this be taken as a testimony delivered by Plato to the <lb/>
            imperishable nature of the world. Its uncreated character <lb/>
            follows from the truth of natural philosophy; for dissolution <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            must of necessity attend everything which is born, and incor­ <lb/>
            ruptibility must inevitably belong to everything which is un­ <lb/>
            born ; since the poet who wrote the following iambic verse, <lb/>
            " All that is born must surely die," * <lb/>
            appears to have spoken very correctly when he asserted this <lb/>
            connection of destructibility with birth.</p>
          <p>The argument may be stated in a different way as follows. <lb/>
            All compound things which are destroyed are dissolved into <lb/>
            the elements of which they were compounded ; accordingly, <lb/>
            dissolution is nothing else but a return of everything to its <lb/>
            original constituent parts ; just as, on the contrary, composition <lb/>
            is that which compel the things combined to come together in <lb/>
            a manner contrary to their nature; and indeed, this appears <lb/>
            to be the most exact truth; for men are composed of the four <lb/>
            elements which together make up the whole of the universe, <lb/>
            the heaven, the earth, the air, and fire, borrowing a few parts <lb/>
            of each in a manner at first sight hardly consistent with <lb/>
            nature. But the things which are thus combined together are <lb/>
            necessarily deprived of a motion in accordance with nature; for <lb/>
            instance, warmth is deprived of its upward motion, and coldness <lb/>
            of its downward tendency, the earthy and somewhat weighty <lb/>
            substance being lightened and assuming the higher place, <lb/>
            which the most earth-like of our own parts, the head, has <lb/>
            obtained in us. But of all bonds, that is the worst which is <lb/>
            forged by violence, and which, being violent, is also short- <lb/>
            lived ; for it is speedily broken by those who are bound in it, <lb/>
            since they become restive from their desire for a motion in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with nature, to which they hasten; for as the tragic <lb/>
            poet says,t- <lb/>
            " And for things sprung from earth, they must <lb/>
            Return unto their parent dust, <lb/>
            While those from heavenly seed which rise <lb/>
            Are borne uplifted to the skies. <lb/>
            Nought that has once existed dies, <lb/>
            Though often what has been combined <lb/>
            Before, we separated find, <lb/>
            Invested with another form." <lb/>
            And this law and ordinance is established with reference to <note type="footnote"> * Timæus, p. 32. </note><note type="footnote"> + A fragment from the Chrysippus of Euripides. </note> <note type="footnote"> D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            everything which is destroyed, that wherever composite things <lb/>
            are existing in combination they are thrown into disorder <lb/>
            instead of into the order in accordance with nature, which they <lb/>
            previously enjoyed, and they are removed to situations opposite <lb/>
            to those in which they were previously placed, so that they <lb/>
            seem in a manner to be sojourners ; and when they are dis­ <lb/>
            solved again, then they return to the appropriate parts allotted <lb/>
            to them by nature.</p>
          <p>XII. But since the world has no participation in that irregu­ <lb/>
            larity which exists in the things which I have just been men­ <lb/>
            tioning, let us stop awhile and consider this point.</p>
          <p>If the world were liable to corruption and destruction, it <lb/>
            follows of necessity that all its parts would at present be <lb/>
            arranged in a position not in accordance with nature : but it is <lb/>
            impious even to imagine such a thing as this ; for all the parts <lb/>
            of the world have received the most excellent position possible, <lb/>
            and an arrangement of the purest symmetry and harmony; so <lb/>
            that each individual part, being content with its place as a <lb/>
            native country to it, does not seek any change for the better. <lb/>
            On this account it is that the most central position of all has <lb/>
            been assigned to the earth, to which all things belonging to <lb/>
            it adhere, and to which they descend again even if you throw <lb/>
            them into the air: and this is a proof that their place is in <lb/>
            accordance with nature; for wherever anything is borne with­ <lb/>
            out any violence, and where it then remains firm and stationary, <lb/>
            that is clearly its natural place. And then, in the second <lb/>
            place, water was poured over the earth, and air and fire <lb/>
            have gone from the central to the upper part, air having <lb/>
            received for its portion the region which is on the borders <lb/>
            between air and fire, and fire having received the highest place <lb/>
            of all: on which account, if you light a torch and press it down <lb/>
            towards the ground, nevertheless the flame will still turn in a <lb/>
            contrary direction, and lightening itself in accordance with the <lb/>
            natural motion of fire, will rise upwards : if, then, motion con­ <lb/>
            trary to nature is the cause of corruptibility and destruction in <lb/>
            the case of other animals, but if in the case of the world every <lb/>
            one of its parts is arranged in complete accordance with <lb/>
            nature, having had appropriate positions allotted to each of <lb/>
            them, then surely the world must most justly be pronounced <lb/>
            incorruptible and imperishable.</p>
          <p>Moreover this point is manifest to every one, that every <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            nature is desirous to keep and preserve, and if it were possible <lb/>
            to make immortal, everything of which it is the nature ; the <lb/>
            nature of trees, for instance, desires to preserve trees, and the <lb/>
            nature of animals desires to preserve each individual animal. <lb/>
            But particular nature is of necessity unable to conduct what <lb/>
            it belongs to to eternity; for want, or heat, or cold, or innu­ <lb/>
            merable other ordinary circumstances, when they affect parti­ <lb/>
            cular things, shake them and dissolve the bond which previ­ <lb/>
            ously held them together, and at last break them to pieces; <lb/>
            but if nothing resembling any of these things were lying in <lb/>
            wait outside, then in that case nature itself, as far as it is <lb/>
            possible, would preserve everything both great and small free <lb/>
            from old age.</p>
          <p>It follows therefore of necessity, that the nature of the <lb/>
            world must desire the durability of the universe ; for it is not <lb/>
            worse than particular natures, so that it should run away and <lb/>
            desert its proper duties, and attempt to produce disease <lb/>
            instead of health, and corruption and destruction instead of <lb/>
            complete safety, since,* <lb/>
            "High over all she lifts her beauteous face, <lb/>
            And towers above her nymphs with heavenly grace, <lb/>
            Fair as they all appear."</p>
          <p>But if this be true, then the world cannot be capable of <lb/>
            destruction. Why so ? Because the nature which holds it <lb/>
            together is itself invincible by reason of its exceeding <lb/>
            strength and power, by which it gets the mastery over every <lb/>
            thing else which might be likely to injure it; wherefore Plato <lb/>
            has well said : ☨—" For nothing ever departed from it, nor did <lb/>
            anything ever come to it from any quarter; for that was not <lb/>
            possible ; for there was nothing in existence which could come; <lb/>
            for since it supplies itself with nutriment out of its own con­ <lb/>
            sumption, it also does everything and suffers everything in <lb/>
            itself and by itself, and is compounded with the most consum­ <lb/>
            mate art. For he who created it thought that it would be <lb/>
            better if wholly self-sufficient, than if in continual need of <lb/>
            accessories from other quarters."</p>
          <p>XIII. However, this argument also is a most demonstra­ <lb/>
            tive one, on which I know that vast numbers of philosophers <note type="footnote"> * Homer, Odyssey vi. 107, where the lines quoted are applied to <lb/>
            Latona among her nymphs. </note><note type="footnote"> t Timæus, p. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            pride themselves as one most accurately worked out, and <lb/>
            altogether irresistible; for they inquire what reason there is <lb/>
            for God's destroying the world. For if he destroys it at all <lb/>
            he must do so either with the intention of never making a <lb/>
            world again, or with the object of creating a second fresh one; <lb/>
            now the former idea is inconsistent with the character of God; <lb/>
            for it is proper to change disorder into order, and not order <lb/>
            into disorder; in the second place, it is so because it would <lb/>
            give rise to repentance, which is an affliction and a disease of <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>For he ought either never to have created a world at all, <lb/>
            or else, if he judged that it was a fitting employment for him, <lb/>
            he ought to have been pleased with it after it was made. But <lb/>
            the second reason deserves no superficial examination ; for if <lb/>
            he were intending to make another world instead of that which <lb/>
            exists at present, then of necessity this second world that <lb/>
            would be made, in that case, would be either worse than, or <lb/>
            similar to, or better than the first; everyone of which ideas is <lb/>
            inadmissible; for if the new world is to be worse than the <lb/>
            former, then the maker must be also worse: but all the works <lb/>
            of God are without blemish, beyond all reproach and wholly <lb/>
            faultless, inasmuch as they are wrought with the most consum­ <lb/>
            mate skill and knowledge ; for as the proverb says ;— <lb/>
            "For e'en a woman's wisdom's not so coarse <lb/>
            As to despise the good and choose the worse." <lb/>
            But it is consistent with the character of, and becoming to <lb/>
            God to give form to what is shapeless, and to invest what is <lb/>
            most ugly with admirable beauty.</p>
          <p>Again, if the new world is to be exactly like the old one, <lb/>
            then the maker is only wasting his labour, and differs in no <lb/>
            respect from infant children who, very often while playing on <lb/>
            the sea shore raise up little mounds of sand, and then pull <lb/>
            them down again with their hands and destroy them; for it <lb/>
            would have been much better- than making another world <lb/>
            exactly like the former, neither to take anything from, nor to <lb/>
            add anything to, nor to change either for the better or for the <lb/>
            worse, what existed originally, but to let it remain just as it <lb/>
            was.</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, he is about to make a world better <lb/>
            than the former one, then the maker too must be better than <lb/>
            the maker of the former world, so that when he made the <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            former world he was inferior both in his skill and in his intel­ <lb/>
            lect, which it is impious even to imagine, for God is at all <lb/>
            times equal and similar to himself, being neither capable of <lb/>
            any relaxation which can make him worse, nor of any extension <lb/>
            which can make him better. Men, indeed, do admit of such <lb/>
            inequalities in either direction, being naturally liable to alter <lb/>
            either for the better or for the worse, and continually admitting <lb/>
            of increase, and advance, and improvement, and everything <lb/>
            contrary to these states ; and besides this, the works of us who <lb/>
            are but mortal men may very appropriately be perishable, but <lb/>
            the works of the immortal must in all consistency and reason <lb/>
            be likewise imperishable, for it is natural that what is made <lb/>
            should resemble the nature of the maker.</p>
          <p>XIV. And, indeed, this I imagine is evident to every one, <lb/>
            that if the earth were to be destroyed, then all land animals of <lb/>
            every kind must also perish with it; and if the water were <lb/>
            destroyed, all aquatic animals must perish; and in like manner <lb/>
            if the air and fire were to be destroyed, all the animals which <lb/>
            traverse the air or which are born in the fire must come to an <lb/>
            end at the same time. Therefore, on the same principle, if <lb/>
            the heaven is destroyed, the sun and moon will also be <lb/>
            destroyed, and all the other planets likewise will be destroyed, <lb/>
            and all the fixed stars, and all that host of gods visible to the <lb/>
            outward senses which was formerly considered so happy ; and <lb/>
            to imagine this is nothing else than to fancy the gods them­ <lb/>
            selves in a process of destruction, for this is equivalent to <lb/>
            considering men immortal. And yet in a comparison between <lb/>
            different objects devoid of honour, if you were to consider the <lb/>
            matter, you would find it more consistent with probability to <lb/>
            look on men as immortal than to believe that the gods are <lb/>
            perishable, since it might happen through the grace of God, <lb/>
            for it is not improbable that a mortal might receive immor­ <lb/>
            tality, but it is impossible for gods to lose their immortality <lb/>
            even if the sophistries of mankind should run on to ever such <lb/>
            a degree of wicked insanity.</p>
          <p>And, moreover, those persons who allege conflagrations and <lb/>
            regenerations of the world, think and confess that the stars are <lb/>
            gods, which nevertheless they are not ashamed to destroy as <lb/>
            far as their arguments go; for they are bound to prove them <lb/>
            to be either red hot pieces of iron, as some do affirm, who <lb/>
            argue about the whole of the heaven as if it were a prison, <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            talking utter nonsense, or else to look upon them as divine <lb/>
            and godlike natures, and then to attribute to them that immor­ <lb/>
            tality which belongs to gods.</p>
          <p>But as it is, they have wandered so far from true doctrine, <lb/>
            that without being. aware of it they have attributed corrupti­ <lb/>
            bility and perishableness to providence (and that is the soul of <lb/>
            the world) by the inconsistent principles which they advocate. <lb/>
            Therefore Chrysippus, the most celebrated philosopher of that <lb/>
            sect, in his treatise about Increase, utters some such prodigious <lb/>
            assertions as these, and after he has prefaced his doctrines <lb/>
            with the assertion that it is impossible for two makers of a <lb/>
            species to exist in the same substance, he proceeds, " Let it be <lb/>
            granted for the sake of argument and speculation that there is <lb/>
            one person entire and sound, and another wanting one foot <lb/>
            from his birth, and that the sound man is called Dion and the <lb/>
            cripple Theon, and afterwards that Dion also loses one of his <lb/>
            feet, then if the question were asked which had been spoiled, it <lb/>
            would be more natural to say this of Theon;" but this is the <lb/>
            assertion of one who delights in paradox rather than in truth, <lb/>
            for how could it be said that be who had suffered no mutilation <lb/>
            whatever, namely Theon, was taken off, and that Dion, who <lb/>
            had lost a foot, was not injured ? Very appropriately, he will <lb/>
            reply, for Dion, who had had his foot out off, falls back upon <lb/>
            the original imperfection of Theon, and there cannot be two <lb/>
            specific differences in the same subject, therefore it follows of <lb/>
            necessity that Dion must remain, and that Theon must be <lb/>
            taken off. <lb/>
            " So are we slain by arrows winged <lb/>
            With our own feathers," * <lb/>
            as the tragic poet says. For any one, copying the form of this <lb/>
            argument and adapting it to the entire world, may prove in <lb/>
            the clearest manner that providence itself is liable to corrup­ <lb/>
            tion. Consider the matter thus : let the world be the subject <lb/>
            of our argument, as Dion was just now, for it is perfect, and <lb/>
            let the soul of the world take the place of Theon, who was <note type="footnote"> * From the Myrmidons of AEschylus. The passage is evidently the <lb/>
            original of the stanza in Waller's Ode to a Lady Singing­ <lb/>
            " That eagle's fate and mine are one, <lb/>
            Who on the shaft that made him die, <lb/>
            Espied a feather of his own, <lb/>
            Wherewith he wont to soar so high." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            imperfect, since a part is less than the whole; and as the foot <lb/>
            was cut off from Dion, so also let everything which resembles <lb/>
            a body be cut off from the world; therefore it is necessary to <lb/>
            say that the world has not been destroyed though its body has <lb/>
            been taken away, just as Dion was not destroyed by having his <lb/>
            foot cut off, but the soul of the world it is that has perished, <lb/>
            like Theon, who suffered no artificial mutilation, for the world <lb/>
            also receded to a lesser substance when all of it that resembled <lb/>
            a body was taken away. And the soul was destroyed because <lb/>
            there could not be two specific differences affecting the same <lb/>
            subject. But it is impiety to say that providence perishes, <lb/>
            and since it is imperishable it follows of necessity that the <lb/>
            world also must be imperishable.</p>
          <p>XV. However, time also affords a very great argument in <lb/>
            favour of the eternity of the world, for if time is uncreated, <lb/>
            then it follows of necessity that the world also must be <lb/>
            uncreated. Why so ? Because, as the great Plato says, it is <lb/>
            days, and nights, and months, and the periods of years which <lb/>
            have shown time, and it is surely impossible that time can <lb/>
            exist without the motion of the suu, and the rotary progress <lb/>
            of the whole heaven. So that it has been defined very felici­ <lb/>
            tously by those who are in the habit of giving definitions of <lb/>
            things, that time is the interval of the motion of the world, <lb/>
            and since this is a sound definition, then the world must be <lb/>
            co-eval with time and also the cause of its existence.</p>
          <p>And it is the most absurd of all ideas to fancy that there <lb/>
            ever was a time when the world did not exist, for its nature is <lb/>
            without any beginning and without any end, since these very <lb/>
            expressions, " there was," " when," " formerly," all indicate <lb/>
            time; and keeping to this view, then, according to the theory <lb/>
            of the confIagration* ...... he at a late period of his life <lb/>
            entertained doubts and withheld any positive opinion ; for it <lb/>
            does not belong to youth, but to old age, to see clearly things <lb/>
            of solemn importance which it is desirable to understand, and <lb/>
            especially as to matters which it is not the outer sense, which <lb/>
            is irrational and deceitful, that determines, but the pure and <lb/>
            unalloyed intellect.</p>
          <p>XVI. But Boethus adduces the most convincing arguments. <lb/>
            which we shall proceed to mention immediately; for if, says he, <lb/>
            the world was created and is liable to destruction, then some­ <note type="footnote"> * There is supposed to be a very large hiatus here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            thing will be made out of nothing, which appears to be most <lb/>
            absurd even to the Stoics. Why so ? Because it is not <lb/>
            possible to discover any cause of destruction either within or <lb/>
            without, which will destroy the world. For on the outside <lb/>
            there is nothing except perhaps a vacuum, inasmuch as all the <lb/>
            elements in their integrity are collected and contained within <lb/>
            it, and within there is no imperfection so great as to be the <lb/>
            cause of dissolution to so great a thing.</p>
          <p>Again, if it is destroyed without any cause, then it is plain <lb/>
            that from something which has no existence will arise the <lb/>
            engendering of destruction, which is an idea quite inadmissible <lb/>
            by reason; and, indeed, they say that there are altogether <lb/>
            three generic manners of corruption, one which arises from <lb/>
            division, another which proceeds from a destruction of the <lb/>
            distinctive quality which holds the thing together, and the <lb/>
            third from confusion; therefore the things which consist of a <lb/>
            union of separate members, such as flocks of goats, herds of <lb/>
            oxen, choruses, armies; or, again, bodies which are com­ <lb/>
            pounded of limbs joined together, are dissolved by disjunction <lb/>
            and separation. But wax, when stamped with a new impres­ <lb/>
            sion, or softened before being remodelled so as to present a <lb/>
            new and different appearance, is corrupted by a destruction of <lb/>
            the distinctive quality which previously held it together. Other <lb/>
            things are corrupted by confusion, as the medicine which the <lb/>
            physicians call tetrapharmacon, for the powers of the drugs <lb/>
            brought together and combined were destroyed in such a <lb/>
            manner as to produce one perfect medicine of especial virtue.</p>
          <p>By which, then, of these modes of corruption is it becoming <lb/>
            to say that the world is destroyed ? By that which is caused <lb/>
            by separation ? No, for it is not compounded of separate <lb/>
            members so that its different parts can be dispersed, nor of <lb/>
            portions joined together so that they can be dissolved ; nor is <lb/>
            it united together in a similar manner to our own bodies, for <lb/>
            they have the seeds of decay in themselves, and they are <lb/>
            subject to influence of a great variety of things by which they <lb/>
            are at times injured; but the power of the world is invincible, <lb/>
            since by its great superiority to other things it has dominion <lb/>
            over everything.</p>
          <p>Is it then destroyed by a complete destruction of its dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive qualities ? This again is impossible, for there remains. <lb/>
            as the adversaries affirm, a quality of arrangement which by <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            the process of conflagration is only diminished to a lesser sub­ <lb/>
            stance ... Is it destroyed then by confusion ? Away with <lb/>
            such an idea, for in that case it would be necessary to confess <lb/>
            that the corruption of a body can be reduced to a state of <lb/>
            non-existence. Why so ? Because if each of the particular <lb/>
            elements were destroyed separately, it would be possible for it <lb/>
            to become changed into another; but if they are altogether <lb/>
            destroyed at one and the same moment by confusion, then it <lb/>
            would be necessary to imagine what is absolutely impossible.</p>
          <p>Again, besides these arguments, if all things, say they, were <lb/>
            destroyed by fire, then what will God have to do during all <lb/>
            that time, except absolutely nothing? And is it not reasonable <lb/>
            to say so ? For at present, he overlooks and presides over <lb/>
            everything, and regulates everything like a genuine father, <lb/>
            and if one is to say the truth, he guides and directs everything, <lb/>
            sitting as it were by the side of the sun, and moon, and the <lb/>
            other planets, and fixed stars, and also by the air, and the <lb/>
            other parts of the world, and he co-operates with them in. <lb/>
            everything which can conduce to the durability of the universe <lb/>
            and to its blameless management, in accordance with right <lb/>
            reason. But if everything is destroyed, then he will have an <lb/>
            existence which will be rendered absolutely miserable, by in­ <lb/>
            activity and irremediable want of employment; than which <lb/>
            what idea can be more absurd? I hesitate to add, what it <lb/>
            would be impious to say, that death will ensue to God if <lb/>
            absolute inactivity falls to his lot; for if you take away the <lb/>
            perpetual motion of the soul, then you will beyond all question <lb/>
            also destroy the soul itself. And the soul of the world, in the <lb/>
            opinion of those who maintain the opposite doctrine, is God.</p>
          <p>XVII. Is it not however worth while to examine this question, <lb/>
            in what manner there can be a regeneration of all those things <lb/>
            which have been destroyed by fire, and resolved into fire ? for <lb/>
            when their substance has been wholly destroyed by the fire, it <lb/>
            follows of necessity that the fire itself must also be extinguished <lb/>
            as no longer having any nourishment. Therefore, as long as <lb/>
            it remained the seminal principle of arrangement was likewise <lb/>
            preserved, but when it is destroyed that principle is destroyed <lb/>
            with it. But it would be impious, and an impiety of double <lb/>
            dye, not only to attribute destruction to the world, but also to <lb/>
            take away the possibility of its regeneration; as if God <lb/>
            delighted in disorder, and irregularity, and all kinds of evil <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            things. But we must examine this question more accurately, <lb/>
            in the following manner.</p>
          <p>There are three species in fire ; the coal, and the flame, and <lb/>
            the light. Now coal is the fire in its earthy substance, which, <lb/>
            like a sort of spiritual habit, couches and lies hid in a sort of <lb/>
            cavern, pervading it all to its very extremities. And the flame <lb/>
            is that part which, being raised on high, is lifted up from its <lb/>
            fuel. And the light is that which is emitted from the flame, <lb/>
            so as to co-operate with the eyes, in order to enable them to <lb/>
            comprehend what is seen. And the flame occupies the middle <lb/>
            position between the coal and the light; for when it is extin­ <lb/>
            guished it ends in coal, and when it is kindled it excites the <lb/>
            light, which, being deprived of its burning power, blazes. If <lb/>
            therefore, we affirm that the world is dissolved by conflagration, <lb/>
            it would not be coal, because, in that case there will be a great <lb/>
            deal of the earthy substance left behind, in which also fire <lb/>
            must necessarily be contained. But we must agree, that none <lb/>
            of the other bodies subsist any longer, but that earth, and <lb/>
            water, and air, are all dissolved into unmixed fire. Nor, again, <lb/>
            would it become flame ; for that can only exist in connexion <lb/>
            with nourishment; and, if nothing is left behind, being de­ <lb/>
            prived of all nourishment it will immediately be extinguished. <lb/>
            It follows from all this, that it cannot become light either ; for <lb/>
            light by itself has no substance at all, but flows from the things <lb/>
            before mentioned, coal and flame, not in a great degree from <lb/>
            the coal, but very much from the flame ; for it is diffused over <lb/>
            a very great space indeed. But if, as has been already proved. <lb/>
            those things had no existence from the conflagration of all <lb/>
            things, then there could not be any light either. For the <lb/>
            abundant, and vast, and extensive brilliancy of mid-day, when <lb/>
            the sun proceeds under the earth, is at once caused to disappear <lb/>
            by night, especially if it be a moonless night. Therefore the <lb/>
            world is not destroyed by fire, but is indestructible. And if it <lb/>
            should be destroyed by fire, there could not be another created.</p>
          <p>XVIII. On which account some of the Stoics also, being <lb/>
            gifted with a more acute discernment, and perceiving that they <lb/>
            would infallibly be convicted, thought it well to be beforehand <lb/>
            in preparing assistance as it were for a defunct proposition. <lb/>
            But what they prepared was of no use; for, since fire is the <lb/>
            cause of all motion, and since motion is the beginning of <lb/>
            generation, for it is impossible that anything whatever should <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            be generated without motion, they said that before the new <lb/>
            world began to be formed, when it was beginning to be <lb/>
            fashioned, the whole fire would not be extinguished in that <lb/>
            conflagration ; that they affirmed that some would still remain, <lb/>
            but yet only a small portion. For they were exceedingly <lb/>
            cautious, lest if it should be wholly extinguished, the conse­ <lb/>
            quence would be that everything would remain motionless and <lb/>
            devoid of ornament, inasmuch as the cause of motion would no <lb/>
            longer be in any existence. But all these ideas are the <lb/>
            invention of quibblers, who employ all their artifices in <lb/>
            opposition to the truth. Why so ? Because it is impossible, as <lb/>
            has been proved already, that the world, after it has been <lb/>
            destroyed by conflagration, should become similar to coal, inas­ <lb/>
            much as there is a vast quantity of earthy substance left in <lb/>
            which the fire must of necessity lie in ambush. And perhaps <lb/>
            too the conflagration could not prevail in every quarter, if the <lb/>
            heaviest and most invincible of the elements, namely the earth, <lb/>
            still remains, without being dissolved ; but it must of necessity <lb/>
            change, either into flame or into light: into flame, as Cleanthes <lb/>
            thought; into light, as Chrysippus conceived. But if it <lb/>
            becomes flame, then, when it approaches extinction, it will be <lb/>
            extinguished all at once, and not partially or gradually. For <lb/>
            the nutriment exists aloug with it; on which account, while <lb/>
            there is a great deal of it, it increases and is diffused; but <lb/>
            when it is stunted it becomes less.</p>
          <p>And any one might conjecture the truth of what takes place <lb/>
            from what he sees happen among us. A lamp, when any one <lb/>
            pours oil upon it, gives forth a most brilliant flame; but when <lb/>
            any one ceases to supply it with that nutriment, and leaves only <lb/>
            a small portion in the lamp, then the lamp is at once extin­ <lb/>
            guished, and does not give out the smallest portion of flame.</p>
          <p>If again this is not the case, but if the world becomes light, <lb/>
            then again it changes altogether. Why so ? Because it has no <lb/>
            substance or character of its own, but is generated from flame, <lb/>
            and when this is wholly and completely extinguished in all its <lb/>
            parts, it follows of necessity that the light also must be extin­ <lb/>
            guished, and that not partially, but altogether. For what <lb/>
            flame is to nourishment, that also is light to flame. As there­ <lb/>
            fore the flame is extinguished concurrently with the want of <lb/>
            nourishment, so also is the light simultaneously with the flame, <lb/>
            so that it is actually impossible for the world to be capable of <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            regeneration, if there is no seminal principle lurking and <lb/>
            kindled within it, but if all things are expended and destroyed, <lb/>
            some by fire, and some by want. From all which arguments <lb/>
            it is plain that the world is for ever uncreated and imperishable.</p>
          <p>XIX. Nevertheless, as Chrysippus says, some suppose that <lb/>
            fire resolves all the arrangement of the universe when the <lb/>
            elements are separated into itself, so that it becomes the seed <lb/>
            of the world which is about to be made; and suppose in conse­ <lb/>
            quence that, of all the ideas which he and his sect have <lb/>
            entertained on the subject, none are falsified. Granting, in the <lb/>
            first place, that generation proceeds from seed, and that all <lb/>
            dissolution is a resolving back into seed; in the second place, <lb/>
            because it is argued by natural philosophers that the world is <lb/>
            a rational nature, inasmuch as it is not only possessed of life, <lb/>
            but is also endowed with intellect, and moreover even with <lb/>
            wisdom; by these arguments he establishes the contrary <lb/>
            proposition to that which he intends, namely, that it will never <lb/>
            be destroyed. But the proofs are ready at hand to those who <lb/>
            do not fear to join in the investigation.</p>
          <p>Therefore the world resembles either a plant or an animal. <lb/>
            But whether it is a plant or whether it is an animal, still, if it <lb/>
            be destroyed by conflagration, it will never be itself its own <lb/>
            seed. And the circumstances which take place among our­ <lb/>
            selves bear witness that nothing, whether greater or less, when <lb/>
            destroyed, has ever been separated in such a manner as to <lb/>
            engender seed. Do you not see how many materials of plants <lb/>
            susceptible of cultivation there are, and how many kinds of <lb/>
            wild plants too are diffused over every portion of the earth ? <lb/>
            Every one of these trees, as long as the trunk is in good health, <lb/>
            together with its fruit, produces also a seed to propagate its <lb/>
            species; but becoming destroyed after a lapse of time, and <lb/>
            being wholly withered, roots and all, it never becomes resolved <lb/>
            into a ripened seed. And so too in the same manner the <lb/>
            different kinds of animals, which it is not easy even to enume­ <lb/>
            rate by reason of their multitude, as long as they survive and <lb/>
            flourish vigorously, produce a seed, which is calculated to <lb/>
            propagate their species; but when they are dead there is no <lb/>
            longer any seed.</p>
          <p>For it would be absurd for a man when he is alive to employ <lb/>
            only the eighth part of his soul, which is called the generative <lb/>
            power, for the propagation of a being like himself, but after he <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            is dead to exert the whole of himself for the same purpose; for <lb/>
            death can never be more energetic or efficacious than life. <lb/>
            And besides, there is no single existing thing which is brought <lb/>
            to perfection by seed alone without its appropriate nourishment. <lb/>
            For seed resembles the beginning, and the beginning by itself <lb/>
            does not make perfect; for beware of imagining that the ear <lb/>
            of corn blossoms and ripens solely from the seed, which is cast <lb/>
            by the husbandman on the ploughed field ; for in truth, dry­ <lb/>
            ness and moisture, the twofold moisture which is derived from <lb/>
            the earth, co-operate in the greatest degree towards its growth. <lb/>
            And so the creature which is fashioned in the womb is not <lb/>
            permitted by nature to be brought to life and perfection by the <lb/>
            seed alone, but also by the nourishment shed upon it from <lb/>
            without, which the woman who has conceived supplies.</p>
          <p>Why then do I say this ? Because in the case of such a <lb/>
            conflagration as that of which I have been speaking, the seed <lb/>
            alone will be left, there being no nutriment remaining, since <lb/>
            everything which was to have supplied nutriment will have <lb/>
            been resolved into fire; so that the world, which would be to <lb/>
            be formed, according to the principle of regeneration, will <lb/>
            have a lame and imperfect form and character, since that <lb/>
            which is chiefly required to co'operate towards its perfection, <lb/>
            on which, as on a staff, the seminal origin ought to, and <lb/>
            naturally does, lean, is destroyed ; but this would be absurd, <lb/>
            as is shown, and made manifest from the clearest evidence.</p>
          <p>Again, all those things which derive their origin from seed <lb/>
            are of a greater magnitude than the seed which gives them <lb/>
            their existence, and are seen to fill a more extended space; <lb/>
            for very often trees, whose tops reach to heaven itself, shoot <lb/>
            up out of a very small grain of seed; and the fattest and <lb/>
            tallest auimals grow from a very small quantity of moisture, <lb/>
            which is laid as their foundation; but there happens that <lb/>
            which was mentioned a little while ago, that these, at the <lb/>
            time nearest to their birth are very little, but that subse­ <lb/>
            quently they keep on increasing in size till they arrive at <lb/>
            complete perfection.</p>
          <p>But in the case of the universe the exact contrary will take <lb/>
            place, for here the seed will both be greater and will also fill <lb/>
            a larger space ; and the ultimate perfection at which the thing <lb/>
            formed arrives will be smaller, and will appear in a smaller <lb/>
            space; and the world, originally derived from a seed, will not <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            progress from a very small thing towards increase, but, on the <lb/>
            other hand, will be diminished from a greater magnitude to a <lb/>
            smaller; and it is easy to see the truth of what is here said.</p>
          <p>Every body, when it is resolved into fire, is dissolved, and <lb/>
            melted, and diffused; and when the flame which is in it is <lb/>
            extinguished, it is then contracted and shrunk up to nothing; <lb/>
            but there is no need of arguments to prove a thing which is so <lb/>
            clear, as if it were obscure; and, indeed, the world, if con­ <lb/>
            sumed by fire, will become greater, inasmuch as all its essence <lb/>
            will then be dissolved into the thinnest air; and it appears to <lb/>
            me that the Stoics have foreseen this, and on that account <lb/>
            have, in their arguments, assumed that a vacuum of infinite <lb/>
            extent will be left abandoned on the outside of the world ; that <lb/>
            so, since it is fated to be subjected to a certain diffusion of <lb/>
            boundless extent, it may not be in want of a place which may <lb/>
            be capable of receiving that diffusion. When therefore it has <lb/>
            been extended and increased to such a degree, as to be very <lb/>
            nearly equal to the infinite extent of the vacuum by the bound­ <lb/>
            less and illimitable extension of its own diffusion, it then, <lb/>
            according to them, is itself the principle of seed to itself; but <lb/>
            when, according to a perfect regeneration of the parts, its <lb/>
            entire substance * ...... being contracted in the extinction <lb/>
            of the fire into dense air; but when the air again is contracted, <lb/>
            and when it settles down into water, then again the water is <lb/>
            still further condensed, so as to be changed into earth, which <lb/>
            is the best of all the elements. But all these arguments are <lb/>
            beyond the ordinary ideas of those who are able to consider <lb/>
            and argue upon the consequences of these things.</p>
          <p>XX. However, besides what has been here said, any one <lb/>
            may use this argument also in corroboration of his opinion, <lb/>
            which will certainly convince all those who are not deter­ <lb/>
            mined to be obstinate beyond all bounds ; of those things <lb/>
            which in pairs are exactly contrary to one another it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible that one thing should be, and that the other should not <lb/>
            be; for since there is white it follows as a matter of absolute <lb/>
            necessity that there must also be black, and since there is a <lb/>
            great there must likewise be a little ; since there is an odd <lb/>
            there must inevitably be an even ; since there is a sweet there <lb/>
            must be a bitter; since there is day there must be night; and <lb/>
            so on in an infinite number of similar cases; but if a conflagra- <note type="footnote"> There seems a line or two lost here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            tion should take place, then something would ensue which is <lb/>
            impossible; for then, of things in a pair, the one will happen <lb/>
            and the other will not.</p>
          <p>Come, now, let us consider the matter thus: if everything <lb/>
            is resolved into fire, there is then something light, and rare, <lb/>
            and warm; for all these are the especial properties of fire; but <lb/>
            there can be nothing heavy, or cold, or thick, which are the <lb/>
            opposites of the qualities which I have just enumerated. How <lb/>
            then can any one more completely overturn the idea of the <lb/>
            universal disorder which would be involved in such a confla­ <lb/>
            gration than by showing that those things which by a law of <lb/>
            nature must exist together, are by this process separated from <lb/>
            their natural conjunction? And the separation has extended <lb/>
            to such a degree, that those who maintain this doctrine attri­ <lb/>
            bute eternal durability to the one and deny any existence at <lb/>
            all to the other.</p>
          <p>Again, there is this assertion made by some of those who <lb/>
            diligently employ themselves in investigating truth which <lb/>
            appears to me to be a sufficiently felicitous one; if the world <lb/>
            is destroyed it will either be destroyed by some other efficient <lb/>
            cause, or by God; now there is certainly nothing else whatever <lb/>
            from which it can receive its destruction, for there is nothing <lb/>
            whatever which it does not surround and contain; but that <lb/>
            which is surrounded and confined within something else is <lb/>
            manifestly inferior in power to that which surrounds and <lb/>
            confines it, by which it is therefore mastered; on the other <lb/>
            hand, to say that it is destroyed by God is the most impious of <lb/>
            all possible assertions; for God is the cause not of disorder, <lb/>
            and irregularity, and destruction, but of order, and beautiful <lb/>
            regularity, and life, and of every good thing, as is confessed by <lb/>
            all those whose opinions are based on truth.</p>
          <p>XXI. But a person may very likely wonder at those who <lb/>
            talk about conflagrations and regenerations, not only on <lb/>
            account of the arguments which I have just been adducing, by <lb/>
            which they are convicted of maintaining erroneous opinions, <lb/>
            but also above all other reasons for this one; for since there <lb/>
            are four elements of which the world consists, namely, earth, <lb/>
            water, air, and fire, why is it that they are to separate fire <lb/>
            from all the others, and to affirm that all the others are <lb/>
            dissolved into that one? For some one may say, if it is <lb/>
            necessary that they should all be resolved into one, why <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            should they not be resolved into air, or water, or earth ? For <lb/>
            these elements also contain powers of great magnitude ; but <lb/>
            yet no one has ever said that the world was to pass away into <lb/>
            air, or into water, or into earth; so that it would be equally <lb/>
            natural to deny that it is resolved into fire.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it would have become them, perceiving the beau­ <lb/>
            tiful equality which exists in the world, to fear and to feel too <lb/>
            great awe to venture to condemn so divine a thing to death : <lb/>
            for there is a most admirable system of compensation existing <lb/>
            in the four elements which arrange and dispense their vicissi­ <lb/>
            tudes by the rules of equality, and the definitions of justice; <lb/>
            for as the seasons of the year, in their proper alternations of <lb/>
            revolutions, go through their regular cycle, completing their <lb/>
            periodical changes without any cessation; in the same manner <lb/>
            suppose that the elements of the world in the course of their <lb/>
            continual interchanges with one another (though it is a most <lb/>
            paradoxical assertion), when they appear to be perishing are <lb/>
            in reality being made immortal, passing over the same course <lb/>
            again and again, so as to have their existence infinitely pro­ <lb/>
            tracted.</p>
          <p>Therefore the steep road begins with the earth; for when it <lb/>
            is wasted away it endures a change to water, and the water <lb/>
            when it has evaporated is changed into air, and the air when <lb/>
            rarefied is changed into fire; but the downward road descends <lb/>
            from the head, when the fire in consequence of the conflagra­ <lb/>
            tion which ensues settles down into air, and again when the <lb/>
            air being closely pressed settles down into water, and when <lb/>
            the water by its copious effusion is condensed so as to be <lb/>
            changed into earth.</p>
          <p>Heraclitus therefore spoke very correctly when he said that, <lb/>
            " Water was the death of the soul, and earth the death of <lb/>
            water." For thinking that the breath was the soul, he indi. <lb/>
            cates, by this figurative and enigmatical expression, that the <lb/>
            end of air is the production of water, and again that the end <lb/>
            of water is the production of earth; and when he speaks of <lb/>
            death lie does not mean utter destruction, but a change into <lb/>
            some other element; that equalised proportion of the elements <lb/>
            which is attempered by itself being thus preserved eternal and <lb/>
            uninjured, as is not only probable but absolutely inevitable ; <lb/>
            since what is unequal is essentially unjust, and injustice is the <lb/>
            offspring of wickedness, and wickedness is banished from the <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            abode of immortality. But the world is of a divine magnitude, <lb/>
            and has been shown to be the abode of those gods which are <lb/>
            visible to the outward senses; and to affirm that this world is <lb/>
            destroyed is the part of those who do not see the connection <lb/>
            of nature and the united consequence and coherence of things.</p>
          <p>XXII. But some of those persons who have fancied that <lb/>
            the world is everlasting, inventing a variety of new arguments, <lb/>
            employ also such a system of reasoning as this to establish <lb/>
            their point: they affirm that there are four principal manners <lb/>
            in which corruption is brought about, addition, taking away, <lb/>
            transposition, and alteration; accordingly, the number two is <lb/>
            by the addition of the unit corrupted so as to become the <lb/>
            number three, and no longer remains the number two; and <lb/>
            the number four by the taking away of the unit is corrupted <lb/>
            so as to become the number three ; again, by transposition the <lb/>
            letter Z becomes the letter H when the parallel lines which <lb/>
            were previously horizontal are placed perpendicularly II, <lb/>
            and when the line which did before pass upwards I, so asto <lb/>
            connect the two is now made horizontal, and still extended <lb/>
            between them so as to join them. And by alteration the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶ</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>, wine, becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄξος</foreign>, vinegar.</p>
          <p>But of the manner of corruption thus mentioned there is <lb/>
            not one which is in the least degree whatever applicable to the <lb/>
            world, since otherwise what could we say ? Could we affirm <lb/>
            that anything is added to the world so as to cause its destruc­ <lb/>
            tion ? But there is nothing whatever outside of the world <lb/>
            which is not a portion of it as the whole, for everything is <lb/>
            surrounded, and contained, and mastered by it. Again, can <lb/>
            we say that anything is taken from the world so as to have <lb/>
            that effect? In the first place that which would be taken <lb/>
            away would again be a world of smaller dimensions than the <lb/>
            existing one, and in the second place it is impossible that any <lb/>
            body could be separated from the composite fabric of the <lb/>
            whole world so as to be completely dispersed. Again, are we <lb/>
            to say that the constituent parts of the world are transposed ? <lb/>
            But at all events they remain in their original positions without <lb/>
            any change of place, for never at any time shall the whole <lb/>
            earth be raised up above the water, nor the water above the <lb/>
            air, nor the air above the fire. But those things which are <lb/>
            by nature heavy, namely the earth and the water, will have <lb/>
            the middle place, the earth supporting everything like a solid <note type="footnote"> E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            foundation, and the water being above it; and the air and the <lb/>
            fire, which are by nature light, will have the higher position, <lb/>
            but not equally, for the air is the vehicle of the fire; and that <lb/>
            which is carried by anything is of necessity above that which <lb/>
            carries it.</p>
          <p>Once more: we must not imagine that the world is de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by alteration, for the change of any elements is equi­ <lb/>
            pollent, and that which is equipollent is the cause of unvarying <lb/>
            steadiness, and of untroubled durability, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            neither seeks any advantage itself, and is not subject to the <lb/>
            inroads of other things which seek advantages at its expense; <lb/>
            so that this retribution and compensation of these powers is <lb/>
            equalized by the rules of proportion, being the produce of <lb/>
            health and endless preservation, by all which considerations <lb/>
            the world is demonstrated to be eternal.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Theophrastus, moreover, says that those men who <lb/>
            attribute a beginning and destructibility to the world are <lb/>
            deceived by four particulars of the greatest importance, the <lb/>
            inequalities of the earth, the retreat of the sea, the dissolution <lb/>
            of each of the parts of the universe, and the destruction of <lb/>
            different terrestrial animals in their kinds; and he proceeds to <lb/>
            establish the first point thus: if the earth had never had any <lb/>
            beginning of its creation, then there would have been no <lb/>
            portion of it rising above the rest so as to be conspicuous, but <lb/>
            all the mountains would have been level, and all the pieces of <lb/>
            rising ground would have been even with the plain.</p>
          <p>For as there are such vast showers falling from heaven <lb/>
            throughout all ages, it would be natural that of any places <lb/>
            which were originally raised on high some would be broken <lb/>
            down and washed away by torrents, and others would subside <lb/>
            of their own accord and so become lowered, and that every <lb/>
            place everywhere would be smoothed; but now, as things are, <lb/>
            the constant inequalities which exist, and the vast heights of <lb/>
            many mountains, reaching up even to the sky, are so many <lb/>
            proofs that the earth is not eternal.</p>
          <p>For otherwise, as I have said before, all the earth would <lb/>
            long since have been rendered level from one extremity to the <lb/>
            other by the vast rains which would have fallen from the <lb/>
            eternal commencement of time; for it is the character of the <lb/>
            nature of water, and especially of such as descends in a heavy <lb/>
            fall from lofty places, to push some things away by force, and <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            to cut out and hollow other places by its continual dropping, <lb/>
            and in this manner to operate on the hard, rugged, stony <lb/>
            ground not less than men digging. And again, the sea, as <lb/>
            they affirm, is already somewhat diminished, and for proof of <lb/>
            this fact we can appeal to the most celebrated islands, Rhodes <lb/>
            and Delos, for these were in ancient times invisible, being <lb/>
            overwhelmed by and sunk under the sea, but by lapse of time, <lb/>
            as the sea gradually diminished, they by slow degrees rose <lb/>
            above it and came into sight, as the histories which are <lb/>
            written concerning them record. And they used to call Delos <lb/>
            Anaphe, confirming the account here given by both names, <lb/>
            since when it appeared above the waters * it became evident, ☨ <lb/>
            having been formerly invisible and unseen.</p>
          <p>And in addition to these arguments they adduce the facts <lb/>
            that many great and deep bays and gulfs of vast seas have <lb/>
            been dried up, and have become land, and have so turned out <lb/>
            no insignificant addition to the adjacent country when sown <lb/>
            and planted; and on that soil there is still left plenty of proof <lb/>
            of such spots having formerly been sea, in the pebbles, and <lb/>
            shells, and other things which are commonly washed up on <lb/>
            the sea-shore being found in them ; on which account Pindar <lb/>
            says respecting Delos— <lb/>
            " Hail, island raised by God, <lb/>
            Chosen abode <lb/>
            Of fair Latona's son with golden hair. <lb/>
            Hail, ocean's youngest child, <lb/>
            The last immoveable domain <lb/>
            That o'er his bosom smiled. <lb/>
            Upraised from beneath the billowy main <lb/>
            Mortals may call you Delos, but the choir <lb/>
            That dwells upon Olympus' height, <lb/>
            Their chosen bards inspire <lb/>
            To praise thee as earth's brightest, holiest light."‡ <lb/>
            For Pindar has here called Delos the daughter of the ocean, <lb/>
            intending by this enigmatical expression to convey the idea <lb/>
            which I have mentioned. But if the sea is gradually being <lb/>
            diminished then the earth also will be diminished; and in <lb/>
            long revolutions of years every one of the elements will be <lb/>
            entirely consumed and destroyed; and the whole air will be <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">άναφανει̃σα</foreign>, from which '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναφὴ</foreign> is derived. </note><note type="footnote"> ☨ <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δήλη</foreign>, from which <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δη̄̃λος</foreign> is derived. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ This is part of an ode now lost. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            consumed, being diminished by little and little ; and all things <lb/>
            will be absorbed and dissolved into the one substance of fire.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And for the purpose of establishing the third <lb/>
            alternative of this question they use the following argument: <lb/>
            beyond all question that thing is destroyed all the parts of <lb/>
            which are liable to destruction; but all the parts of the world <lb/>
            are liable to destruction, therefore the world also is liable to <lb/>
            destruction.</p>
          <p>But we must now proceed to consider the question which <lb/>
            we postponed till the present time. What sort of a part of <lb/>
            the earth is that, that we may begin from this, whether it is <lb/>
            greater or less, that is not dissolved by time ? Do not <lb/>
            the very hardest and strongest stones become hard and de­ <lb/>
            cayed through the weakness of their conformation (and this <lb/>
            conformation is a sort of course of a highly strained spirit, a <lb/>
            bond not indissoluble, but only very difficult to unloose), in <lb/>
            consequence of which they are broken up and made fluid, so <lb/>
            that they are dissolved first of all into a thin dus't, and after­ <lb/>
            wards are wholly wasted away and destroyed ? Again, if the <lb/>
            water were never agitated by the winds, but were left immove­ <lb/>
            able for ever, would it not from inaction and tranquillity <lb/>
            become dead ? at all events it is changed by such stagnation, and <lb/>
            becomes very foetid and foul-smelling, like an animal deprived <lb/>
            of life. And so also the corruptions of the air are plain to <lb/>
            everyone, for it is the nature of the atmosphere to become <lb/>
            sick and to decay, and, as one may say, in a manner to die; <lb/>
            since what else is it which a man, who is not aiming at select­ <lb/>
            ing plausible language, but only at truth, would call a plague <lb/>
            except a death of the atmosphere, which diffuses its own <lb/>
            disease and suffering to the destruction of everything which is <lb/>
            endowed with life ?</p>
          <p>And why need I speak at great length concerning fire ? for <lb/>
            if it is deprived of nourishment it is immediately extinguished, <lb/>
            becoming, as the poets say, tame by its own natural qualities, <lb/>
            on which account it depends upon, and is raised up by the <lb/>
            duration of the fuel which is supplied and kindled, but when <lb/>
            that is expended the fire also disappears. And they say that <lb/>
            the dragons in India are exposed to the same' kind of fate, for <lb/>
            that they crawl upon the greatest of all beasts, namely ele­ <lb/>
            phants, and creep over their backs and the whole of their <lb/>
            bellies, and then, if they can find a vein, they divide that and <lb/>
             <pb n="55"/>
            drink the blood, sucking it insatiably, with a strong breath and <lb/>
            a vigorous noise. Meantime the elephants, though greatly <lb/>
            drained, and though becoming gradually exhausted, hold out <lb/>
            for some time, leaping about in their perplexity, and lashing <lb/>
            their sides with their trunks in the hope of being able to <lb/>
            shake off the dragons. After a time, as the vital principle is <lb/>
            continually becoming more and more exhausted, they are no <lb/>
            longer able to leap about, but stand trembling and quivering, <lb/>
            and after a little more time their legs become too weak to <lb/>
            support them, and they are thrown down and die for want of <lb/>
            blood. And when they are fallen down those animals which <lb/>
            were the causes of their death die with them in the following <lb/>
            manner : since the dragons have no longer any nourishment, <lb/>
            they attempt to loosen the bonds with which they twined them­ <lb/>
            selves round the elephants, wishing now to get released from <lb/>
            them, but they are pressed down by the weight of the ele­ <lb/>
            phants and crushed, and much more so when the animal has <lb/>
            become a lifeless, hard, and stone-like substance ; for though <lb/>
            they wriggle about and try every expedient in order to effect <lb/>
            their release from the power of the animal which weighs them <lb/>
            down, and by which they are entangled, though they have long <lb/>
            practised themselves in every variety of wile, amid all kinds <lb/>
            of difficulties and distresses, they at last become too weak to <lb/>
            resist, like men who have been starved to death, or who have <lb/>
            been caught by a wall which has suddenly fallen down upon <lb/>
            them, and not being able even to lift up their heads they die of <lb/>
            suffocation.</p>
          <p>If then, each of the separate parts of the world awaits utter <lb/>
            destruction, it is plain that the world which is compounded of <lb/>
            these can not be itself exempt from destruction.</p>
          <p>We must now consider with accuracy the fourth and remain­ <lb/>
            ing argument. Thus they argue: if the world were eternal then <lb/>
            the animals also would be eternal, and much more the human <lb/>
            race, in proportion as that is more excellent than the other <lb/>
            animals; but, on the contrary, those who take delight in inves­ <lb/>
            tigating the mysteries of nature consider that man has only <lb/>
            been created in the late ages of the world; for it is likely, or I <lb/>
            should rather say it is inevitably true, that the arts co-exist <lb/>
            with man, so as to be exactly co-eval with him, not only because <lb/>
            methodical proceedings are appropriate to a rational nature, <lb/>
            but also because it is not possible to live without them; let us <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            therefore examine the dates of each of these, disregarding the <lb/>
            fables invented by the tragedians about the gods; but if man <lb/>
            is not eternal then neither is any other animal, so that then <lb/>
            neither are the places which receive them, the earth, or the <lb/>
            water, or the air ; from all which considerations it is plain that <lb/>
            this world is liable to destruction.</p>
          <p>XXV. But it is necessary to encounter such quibbling <lb/>
            arguments as these, lest some persons of too little experience <lb/>
            should yield to and be led away by them ; and we must begin <lb/>
            our refutation of them from the same point from which the <lb/>
            Sophists begin their deceit. They say, " There could no longer <lb/>
            be any inequalities existing on the earth, if the world were <lb/>
            eternal." Why not, my most excellent friends? For other <lb/>
            persons will come up and say that the natures of trees are in <lb/>
            no respect different from mountains; but just as they at <lb/>
            certain seasons lose their leaves, and again at certain seasons <lb/>
            recover their verdure again; (on which account there is admi­ <lb/>
            rable truth in those lines of the poet :­ <lb/>
            "Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, <lb/>
            Now green in youth, now withering on the ground; <lb/>
            Another race the following spring supplies; <lb/>
            They fall successive and successive rise." * <lb/>
            And so in like manner some portions of the mountains are <lb/>
            broken off, and others grow in their stead : but after a long <lb/>
            lapse of time the additional growth becomes conspicuous <lb/>
            because the trees having a more rapid nature, display their <lb/>
            increase with great rapidity; but mountains have a slower <lb/>
            character, on which account it happens that the additions <lb/>
            which take place in their case are not perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward senses except after a long time.</p>
          <p>And these men appear to be ignorant of the manner in <lb/>
            which they are produced, since if they had not been, perhaps <lb/>
            they would have been silent out of shame ; but still there is <lb/>
            no reason why we should not teach them; but there is nothing <lb/>
            new in what is now said, neither are they our words but the <lb/>
            ancient sayings of wise men, by whom nothing which was <lb/>
            necessary for knowledge has been left uninvestigated ; when <lb/>
            the fiery principle which is contained beneath, in the earth, is <lb/>
            thrust upwards by the natural power of fire, it proceeds to its <lb/>
            own appropriate place; and if it meets with any respite or <note type="footnote"> * Homer, II. vi. 147. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            relaxation, though ever so slight, it draws up with it a large <lb/>
            portion of the earthy substance, as much as it can ; and when <lb/>
            it has emerged from the earth it proceeds more slowly; but <lb/>
            the earthy substance being compelled to follow it for a long <lb/>
            time, being at last raised to an immense height, is contracted <lb/>
            at the top, and at last comes to end on a sharp point imitating <lb/>
            the general appearance of the flame of fire; for there arises <lb/>
            then a most violent contention between two things which are <lb/>
            natural adversaries, the lightest and the heaviest of things, <lb/>
            each of them pressing onwards to reach its own place, and <lb/>
            each striving against the violent efforts of the other ; accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the fire, which is drawing up the earth with it, is corn­ <lb/>
            pelled to sink down by its descending power; and the earth <lb/>
            naturally inclining to the lowest point is nevertheless to a <lb/>
            certain degree made light, and lifted up by the upward ten­ <lb/>
            dencies of fire, and so is raised on high, and being at last <lb/>
            overpowered by the more influential power which lightens it is <lb/>
            thrust upwards towards the natural seat of fire, and established <lb/>
            on high.</p>
          <p>Why then need we wonder if the mountains are not entirely <lb/>
            washed away by-the impetuosity of the rains, when so great <lb/>
            a power, which keeps them together, and by which they are <lb/>
            raised up, is very firmly and steadfastly connected with them ? <lb/>
            For if they were released from the bond which holds them <lb/>
            together, it would be natural for them to be entirely dissolved <lb/>
            and to be dispersed by the water; but since they are bound <lb/>
            together by this power of fire, they resist the impetuosity of <lb/>
            the rains more surely.</p>
          <p>XXVI. These things, then, may be said by us with respect <lb/>
            to the argument that the inequalities of the surface of the <lb/>
            earth are no proof of the world having been created and being <lb/>
            liable to destruction ; but with respect to that argument which <lb/>
            was endeavoured to be established by the diminution of the <lb/>
            sea, we may reasonably adduce this statement in opposition to <lb/>
            it: " Do not look only at the islands which have risen up out <lb/>
            of the sea, nor at any portions of land which, having been for­ <lb/>
            merly buried by the waters, have in subsequent times become <lb/>
            dry land ; for obstinate contention is very unfavourable to the <lb/>
            consideration of natural philosophy, which considers the search <lb/>
            after truth to be the chief object of rational desire; but look <lb/>
            lather at the contrary effects : consider how many districts on <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            the main-land, not only such as were near the coast, but even <lb/>
            such as were completely in-land, have been swallowed up by <lb/>
            the waters; and consider how great a portion of land has <lb/>
            become sea and is now sailed over by innumerable ships." <lb/>
            Are you ignorant of the celebrated account which is given of <lb/>
            that most sacred Sicilian strait, which in old times joined <lb/>
            Sicily to the continent of Italy?* and where vast seas on each <lb/>
            side being excited by violent storms met together, coming <lb/>
            from opposite directions, the land between them was over­ <lb/>
            whelmed and broken away; from which circumstance the <lb/>
            city built in the neighbourhood was called Rhegium,t and <lb/>
            the result was quite different from what any one would have <lb/>
            expected; for the seas which had formerly been separated <lb/>
            now flowed together and were united in one expanse; and the <lb/>
            land which had previously united was now separated into two <lb/>
            portions by the strait which intersected it, in consequence of <lb/>
            which Sicily, which had previously formed a part of the main­ <lb/>
            land, was now compelled to be an island.</p>
          <p>And it is said that many other cities also have disappeared, <lb/>
            having been swallowed up by the sea which overwhelmed <lb/>
            them; since they speak of three in Peloponnesus— <lb/>
            " Ægira and fair Bura's walls, <lb/>
            And Helica's lofty halls, <lb/>
            And many a once renowned town, <lb/>
            With wreck and seaweed overgrown," <note type="footnote"> * This is alluded to by Virgil- <lb/>
            Hæc loca vi quondam, et vastâ convulsa ruinâ <lb/>
            Tantum ævi longinqua valet mutare vetustas, <lb/>
            Dissiluisse ferunt, quum protenus utraque tellus <lb/>
            Una foret : venit medio vi pontus, et undis <lb/>

            " The Italian shore <lb/>

            An earthquake caused the flaw; the roaring tides <lb/>

            And where the lands retired the'rushing ocean rides <lb/>
            Distinguished by the straits on either hand <lb/>
            Now rising cities in long order stand, <lb/>
            And fruitful fields; so much can time invade <lb/>
            The mouldering work that beauteous nature made." </note><note type="footnote"> ☨ '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ρήγιον</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ρ́ήγνυμι</foreign>, " to break." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            as having been formerly prosperous, but now overwhelmed by <lb/>
            the violent influx of the sea. And the island of Atalantes <lb/>
            which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the <lb/>
            Timæus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the <lb/>
            sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inun­ <lb/>
            dation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed <lb/>
            navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies. Therefore that imagi­ <lb/>
            nary and fictitious diminution of the sea has no connection with <lb/>
            the destruction or durability of the world ; for in fact it ap­ <lb/>
            pears to recede indeed from some parts, but to rise higher in <lb/>
            others; and it would have been proper rather not to look at <lb/>
            only one of these results but at both together, and so to form <lb/>
            one's opinion, since in all the disputed questions which arise <lb/>
            in human life, a wise and honest judge will not deliver his <lb/>
            opinion before he has heard the arguments of the advocates on <lb/>
            both sides.</p>
          <p>XVII. And as for the third argument, it is convicted by <lb/>
            itself, as being derived only from an unsound system of ques­ <lb/>
            tioning proceeding from the assertions originally made; for in <lb/>
            truth it does not necessarily follow that a thing, all the parts <lb/>
            of which are liable to corruption, is likewise perishable itself; <lb/>
            but this is only inevitably true of that thing of which all <lb/>
            the parts are perishable when taken collectively and together <lb/>
            in the same place and at the same time, since in the case of a <lb/>
            person who has the tip of his finger cut off, he is not disabled <lb/>
            from living, but if he had the whole collection of all his parts <lb/>
            and limbs cut off at once, he would die immediately. There­ <lb/>
            fore in the same manner, if all the elements of the world <lb/>
            together were all to disappear at one and the same moment, <lb/>
            then it would be necessary to admit that the world was liable to <lb/>
            corruption and destruction; but if each of these elements <lb/>
            separately only changes its nature so as to assimilate to that of <lb/>
            its nature, it is then rendered immortal rather than destroyed, <lb/>
            according to the philosophical statement of the tragic poet­ <lb/>
            "Nought that has once existed dies, <lb/>
            Though often what has been combined <lb/>
            Before, we separated find, <lb/>
            Invested with another form," <lb/>
            For it is the greatest folly imaginable to estimate the antiquity <lb/>
            of the human race from the state of art; for if any one were to <lb/>
            follow the absurdity of such a system of reasoning as this, he <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            will prove the world to be very young indeed, and to have been <lb/>
            made scarcely a thousand years, since all those men whom we <lb/>
            have heard of traditionally as the discoverers in different <lb/>
            branches of science do not go back to a greater number of <lb/>
            years than that which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>But if we must speak of the arts as co-eval with the race of <lb/>
            mankind, then we must speak, drawing our arguments from <lb/>
            natural history, and not inconsiderately or carelessly. And <lb/>
            what is this history ? The destruction of the things on the <lb/>
            earth, not all together, but of the greatest number of them, is <lb/>
            attributed to two principal causes, the indescribable violence <lb/>
            and power of fire and water. And they say that each of these <lb/>
            elements attacks them in its turn, after very long periods of <lb/>
            revolving years. When, therefore, a conflagration seizes upon <lb/>
            things, a stream of ethereal fire being poured down from above <lb/>
            is frequently diffused over them, overrunning many districts of <lb/>
            the habitable world; and when a deluge draws down the whole <lb/>
            of the rainy nature of water, the regular rivers and torrents <lb/>
            overflowing, and not only that, but even far exceeding the <lb/>
            ordinary measure of a common flood, and breaking down their <lb/>
            banks with their violence, or else overleaping them, and rising <lb/>
            to an enormous height, from which they swell and are diffused <lb/>
            over all the adjacent champaign country, and the land is in the <lb/>
            first instance divided into huge lakes, as the water is con­ <lb/>
            tinually settling down into the more hollow parts, and after­ <lb/>
            wards flows still higher, and inundates the isthmuses which <lb/>
            separate the lakes, till at last everything presents the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of one vast sea from the union of so many waters.</p>
          <p>And then it happens that, through the violence of these powers <lb/>
            contending against one another in turn, the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            places exposed to it are destroyed; those who dwell on the <lb/>
            mountains and higher ground, and in ill-watered districts, <lb/>
            being destroyed by fire, as not having a sufficiency of water, <lb/>
            which is the natural weapon with which to repel fire, and <lb/>
            those, on the other hand, being destroyed by water who live <lb/>
            on the banks of rivers or lakes, or on the shores of the sea, for <lb/>
            evils like to attack those who are nearest first, or indeed <lb/>
            solely.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, when the greater part of mankind is destroyed <lb/>
            in the manners above mentioned, besides an infinity of other <lb/>
            ways of less power and importance, it follows of necessity that <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            the arts also must fail, for it cannot be possible to discuss <lb/>
            science by itself without some one to reduce it to method and <lb/>
            practice. But when those common pestilences relax their <lb/>
            fury, and when the human race begins again to recover vigour <lb/>
            and to flourish, descending from those who have not been <lb/>
            previously destroyed by the evils which pressed upon them, <lb/>
            then the arts also begin again to exist, not indeed as they were <lb/>
            at first, but in thinner numbers from the diminution of the <lb/>
            numbers of those who practise them.</p>
          <p>I have now then set forth to the best of my ability what I <lb/>

            indestructibility of the world, and in the subsequent treatises <lb/>

            arguments here stated.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE AGAINST FLACCUS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>1. FLACCUS AVILLIUS succeeded Sejanus in his hatred of <lb/>
            and hostile designs against the Jewish nation. He was not, <lb/>
            indeed, able to injure the whole people by open and direct <lb/>
            means as he had been, inasmuch as he had less power for <lb/>
            such a purpose, but he inflicted the most intolerable evils on <lb/>
            all who came within his reach.</p>
          <p>Moreover, though in appearance he only attacked a portion <lb/>
            of the nation, in point of fact he directed his aims against all <lb/>
            whom he could find anywhere, proceeding more by art than by <lb/>
            force; for those men who, though of tyrannical natures and <lb/>
            dispositions, have not strength enough to accomplish their <lb/>
            designs openly, seek to compass them by manoeuvres.</p>
          <p>This Flaccus being chosen by Tiberius Cæsar as one of his <lb/>
            intimate companions, after the death of Severus, who had been <lb/>
            lieutenant-governor in Egypt, was appointed viceroy of Alex­ <lb/>
            andria and the country round about, being a man who at the <lb/>
            beginning, as far as appearance went, had given innumerable <lb/>
            instances of his excellence, for he was a man of prudence and <lb/>
            diligence, and great acuteness of perception, very energetic in <lb/>
            executing what he had determined on, very eloquent as a <lb/>
            speaker, and skilful too at discerning what was suppressed as <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            well as at understanding what was said. Accordingly in a <lb/>
            short time he became perfectly acquainted with the affairs of <lb/>
            Egypt, and they are of a very various and diversified character, <lb/>
            so that they are not easily comprehended even by those who <lb/>
            from their earliest infancy have made them their study.</p>
          <p>The scribes were a superfluous body when he had made <lb/>
            such advances towards the knowledge of all things, whether <lb/>
            important or trivial, by his extended experience, that he not <lb/>
            only surpassed them, but from his great accuracy was qualified <lb/>
            instead of a pupil to become the instructor of those who had <lb/>
            hitherto been the teachers of all other persons. However, all <lb/>
            those things in which he displayed an admirable system and <lb/>
            great wisdom concerning the accounts and the general arrange­ <lb/>
            ment of the revenues of the land, though they were serious <lb/>
            matters and of the last importance, were nevertheless not <lb/>
            such as gave any proofs of a soul fit for the task of governing ; <lb/>
            but those things which exhibited a more brilliant and royal <lb/>
            disposition he also displayed with great freedom. For instance, <lb/>
            he bore himself with considerable dignity, and pride and pomp <lb/>
            are advantageous things for a ruler; and he decided all suits <lb/>
            of importance in conjunction with the magistrates, he pulled <lb/>
            down the overproud, he forbade promiscuous mobs of men from <lb/>
            all quarters to assemble together, and prohibited all associa­ <lb/>
            tions and meetings which were continually feasting together <lb/>
            under pretence of sacrifices, making a drunken mockery of <lb/>
            public business, treating with great vigour and severity all who <lb/>
            resisted his commands.</p>
          <p>Then when he had filled the whole city and country with his <lb/>
            wise legislation, he proceeded in turn to regulate the military <lb/>
            affairs of the land, issuing commands, arranging matters, <lb/>
            training the troops of every kind, infantry, cavalry, and light- <lb/>
            armed, teaching the commanders not to deprive the soldiers of <lb/>
            their pay, and so drive them to acts of piracy and rapine, and <lb/>
            teaching each individual soldier not to proceed to any actions <lb/>
            unauthorised by his military service, remembering that he was <lb/>
            appointed with the especial object of preserving peace.</p>
          <p>II. Perhaps some one may say here : "Do you then, my <lb/>
            good man, you who have determined to accuse this man, bring <lb/>
            no accusation whatever against him, but on the contrary, weave <lb/>
            long panegyrics in his honour? Arc you not doting and mad?"</p>
          <p>" I am not mad, my friend, nor am I a downright fool, so as <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            to be unable to see the consequences or connexion of things. <lb/>
            I praise Flaccus, not because it is right to praise an enemy, <lb/>
            but in order to make his wickedness more conspicuous; for <lb/>
            pardon is given to a man who does wrong from ignorance of <lb/>
            what is right; but he who does wrong knowingly has no <lb/>
            excuse, being already condemned by the tribunal of his own <lb/>
            conscience. "</p>
          <p>III. For having received a government which was intended <lb/>
            to last six years, for the first five years, while Tiberius Cæsar <lb/>
            was alive, he both preserved peace and also governed the <lb/>
            country generally with such vigour and energy that he was <lb/>
            superior to all the governors who had gone before him. But <lb/>
            in the last year, after Tiberius was dead, and when Caius had <lb/>
            succeeded him as emperor, he began to relax in and to be <lb/>
            indifferent about everything, whether it was that he was over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with most heavy grief because of Tiberius (for it was <lb/>
            evident to everyone that he grieved exceedingly as if for a near <lb/>
            relation, both by his continued depression of spirits and his <lb/>
            incessant weeping, pouring forth tears without end as if from <lb/>
            an inexhaustible fountain), or whether it was because he was <lb/>
            disaffected to his successor, because he preferred devoting him­ <lb/>
            self to the party of the real rather than to that of the adopted <lb/>
            children, or whether it was because he had been one of those <lb/>
            who had joined in the conspiracy against the mother of Caius, <lb/>
            having joined against her at the time when the accusations <lb/>
            were brought against her, on account of which she was put to <lb/>
            death, and having escaped through fear of the consequence of <lb/>
            proceeding against him.</p>
          <p>However, for a time he still paid some attention to the <lb/>
            affairs of the state, not wholly abandoning the administration of <lb/>
            his government; but when he heard that the grandson of <lb/>
            Tiberius and his partner in the government had been put to <lb/>
            death at the command of Caius, he was smitten with intolerable <lb/>
            anguish, and threw himself on the ground, and lay there <lb/>
            speechless, being utterly deprived of his senses, for indeed his <lb/>
            mind had long since been enervated by grief.</p>
          <p>For as long as that child lived he did not despair of some <lb/>
            sparks still remaining of his own safety, but now that he was <lb/>
            dead. he considered that all his own hopes had likewise died <lb/>
            with him, even if a slight breeze of assistance might still be <lb/>
            left, such as his friendship with Macro, who had unbounded <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            influence with Cams in his authority; and who, as it is said. <lb/>
            had very greatly contributed to his obtaining the supreme <lb/>
            power, and in a still higher degree to his personal safety, since <lb/>
            Tiberius had frequently thought of putting Caius out of the <lb/>
            way, as a wicked man and one who was in no respects calcu­ <lb/>
            lated by nature for the exercise of authority, being influenced <lb/>
            also partly by his apprehensions for his grandson ; for he feared <lb/>
            lest, when he himself was dead, his death too would be added to <lb/>
            the funerals of his family.</p>
          <p>But Macro had constantly bade him discard these apprehen­ <lb/>
            sions from his mind, and had praised Caius, as a man of a <lb/>
            simple, and honest, and sociable character; and as one who was <lb/>
            very much attached to his cousin, so that he would willingly <lb/>
            yield the supreme authority to him alone, and the first rank in <lb/>
            everything. And Tiberius, being deceived by all these repre­ <lb/>
            sentations, without being aware of what he was doing, left <lb/>
            behind him a most irreconcileable enemy, to himself, and his <lb/>
            grandson, and his whole family, and to Macro, who was his <lb/>
            chief adviser and comforter, and to all mankind; for when <lb/>
            Macro saw that Caius was forsaking the way of virtue and <lb/>
            yielding to his unbridled passions, following them wherever <lb/>
            they led him and against whatever objects they led him, he <lb/>
            admonished and reproved him, looking upon him as the same <lb/>
            Caius who, while Tiberius was alive, was mild-tempered and <lb/>
            docile ; but to his misery he suffered most terrible punishment <lb/>
            for his exceeding, good-will, being put to death with his wife, <lb/>
            and children, and all his family, as a grievous and troublesome <lb/>
            object to his new sovereign. For whenever he saw him at a <lb/>
            distance coming towards him, he used to speak in this <lb/>
            manner to those who were with him : " Let us not smile; let <lb/>
            us look sad: here comes the censor and monitor; the all-wise <lb/>
            man, he who is beginning now to be the schoolmaster of a <lb/>
            full-grown man, and of an emperor, after time itself has sepa­ <lb/>
            rated him from and discarded the tutors of his earliest <lb/>
            infancy."</p>
          <p>IV. When, therefore, Flaccus learnt that he too was put <lb/>
            to death, he utterly abandoned all other hope for the future, <lb/>
            and was no longer able to apply himself to public affairs as he <lb/>
            had done before, being enervated and wholly broken down in <lb/>
            spirit. But when a magistrate begins to despair of his power <lb/>
            of exerting authority, it follows inevitably, that his subjects <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            must quickly become disobedient, especially those who are <lb/>
            naturally, at every trivial or common occurrence, inclined to <lb/>
            show insubordination, and, among people of such a disposition, <lb/>
            the Egyptian nation is pre-eminent, being constantly in the <lb/>
            habit of exciting great seditions from very small sparks.</p>
          <p>And being placed in a situation of great and perplexing dif­ <lb/>
            ficulty he began to rage, and simultaneously, with the change <lb/>
            of his disposition for the worse, he also altered everything <lb/>
            which had existed before, beginning with his nearest friends <lb/>
            and his most habitual customs; for he began to suspect and <lb/>
            to drive from him those who were well affected to him, and <lb/>
            who were most sincerely his friends, and he reconciled himself <lb/>
            to those who were originally his declared enemies, and he <lb/>
            used them as advisers under all circumstances; but they, for <lb/>
            they persisted in their ill-will, being reconciled with him only <lb/>
            in words and in appearance, but in their actions and in their <lb/>
            hearts they bore him incurable enmity, and though only pre­ <lb/>
            tending a genuine friendship towards him, like actors in a <lb/>
            theatre, they drew him over wholly to their side; and so the <lb/>
            governor became a subject, and the subjects became the <lb/>
            governor, advancing the most unprofitable opinions, and im­ <lb/>
            mediately confirming and insisting upon them; for they be­ <lb/>
            came executors of all the plans which they had devised, <lb/>
            treating him like a mute person on the stage, as one who was <lb/>
            only, by way of making up the show, inscribed with the title <lb/>
            of authority, being themselves a lot of Dionysiuses, dema­ <lb/>
            gogues, and of Lampos, a pack of cavillers and word-splitters; <lb/>
            and of Isidoruses, sowers of sedition, busy-bodies, devisers of <lb/>
            evil, troublers of the state; for this is the name which has, at <lb/>
            last, been given to them.</p>
          <p>All these men, having devised a most grievous design <lb/>
            against the Jews, proceeded to put it in execution, and coming <lb/>
            privately to Flaccus said to him, " All your hope from the <lb/>
            child of Tiberius Nero has now perished, and that which was <lb/>
            your second best prospect, your companion Macro, is gone too, <lb/>
            and you have no chance of favour with the emperor, therefore <lb/>
            we must find another advocate, by whom Caius may be made <lb/>
            propitious to us, and that advocate is the city of Alexandria, <lb/>
            which all the family of Augustus has honoured from the very <lb/>
            beginning, and our present master above all the rest; and it <lb/>
            will be a sufficient mediator in our behalf, if it can obtain one <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            boon from you, and you cannot confer a greater benefit upon <lb/>
            it than by abandoning and denouncing all the Jews."</p>
          <p>Now though upon this he ought to have rejected and driven <lb/>
            away the speakers as workers of revolution and common ene­ <lb/>
            mies, he agrees on the contrary to what they say, and at first <lb/>
            he made his designs against the Jews less evident, only <lb/>
            abstaining from listening to causes brought before his tribunal <lb/>
            with impartiality and equity, and inclining more to one side <lb/>
            than to the other, and not allowing to both sides an equal <lb/>
            freedom of speech; but whenever any Jew came before him <lb/>
            he showed his aversion to him, and departed from his habitual <lb/>
            affability in their case; but afterwards he exhibited his hos­ <lb/>
            tility to them in a more conspicuous manner.</p>
          <p>V. Moreover, some occurrences of the following description <lb/>
            increased that folly and insolence of his which was derived <lb/>
            from instruction rather than from nature. Caius Cæsar gave <lb/>
            Agrippa, the grandson of Herod the king, the third part of his <lb/>
            paternal inheritance as a sovereignty, which Philip the tetrarch, <lb/>
            who was his uncle on his father's side, had previously enjoyed. <lb/>
            And when he was about to set out to take possession of his <lb/>
            kingdom, Caius advised him to avoid the voyage from Brun­ <lb/>
            dusium to Syria, which was a long and troublesome one, and <lb/>
            rather to take the shorter one by Alexandria, and to wait for <lb/>
            the periodical winds; for he said that the merchant vessels <lb/>
            which set forth from that harbour were fast sailers, and that <lb/>
            the pilots were most experienced men, who guided their ships <lb/>
            like skilful coachmen guide their horses, keeping them straight <lb/>
            in the proper course. And lie took his advice, looking upon <lb/>
            him both as his master and also as a giver of good counsel.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, going down to Dicæarchia, and seeing some <lb/>
            Alexandrian vessels in the harbour, looking all ready and fit <lb/>
            to put to sea, he embarked with his followers, and had a fair <lb/>
            voyage, and so a few days afterwards he arrived at his journey's <lb/>
            end, unforeseen and unexpected, having commanded the cap­ <lb/>
            tains of his vessels (for he came in sight of Pharos about <lb/>
            twilight in the evening) to furl their sails, and to keep a short <lb/>
            distance out of sight in the open sea, until it became late in <lb/>
            the evening and dark, and then at night he entered the port, <lb/>
            that when he disembarked he might find all the citizens buried <lb/>
            in sleep, and so, without any one seeing him, he might arrive <lb/>
            at the house of the man who was to be his entertainer. With <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            so much modesty then did this man arrive, wishing if it were <lb/>
            possible to enter without being perceived by any one in the <lb/>
            city.</p>
          <p>For he had not come to see Alexandria, since he had so­ <lb/>
            journed in it before, when he was preparing to take his voyage <lb/>
            to Rome to see Tiberius, but he desired at this time to take <lb/>
            the quickest road, so as to arrive at his destination with the <lb/>
            smallest possible delay. But the men of Alexandria being <lb/>
            ready to burst with envy and ill-will (for the Egyptian dispo­ <lb/>
            sition is by nature a most jealous and envious one and inclined <lb/>
            to look on the good fortune of others as adversity to itself), and <lb/>
            being at the same time filled with an ancient and what I may <lb/>
            in a manner call an innate enmity towards the Jews, were in­ <lb/>
            dignant at any one's becoming a king of the Jews, no less <lb/>
            than if each individual among them had been deprived of an <lb/>
            ancestral kingdom of his own inheritance.</p>
          <p>And then again his friends and companions came and stirred <lb/>
            up the miserable Flaccus, inviting, and exciting, and stimu­ <lb/>
            lating him to feel the same envy with themselves ; saying, <lb/>
            " The arrival of this man to take upon him his government is <lb/>
            equivalent to a deposition of yourself. He is invested with a <lb/>
            greater dignity of honour and glory than you. He attracts <lb/>
            all eyes towards himself when they see the array of sentinels <lb/>
            and body-guards around him adorned with silvered and gilded <lb/>
            arms. For ought he to have come into the presence of <lb/>
            another governor, when it was in his power to have sailed over <lb/>
            the sea, and so to have arrived in safety at his own govern­ <lb/>
            ment? For, indeed, if Caius did advise or rather command <lb/>
            him to do so, he ought rather with earnest solicitations to have <lb/>
            deprecated any visit to this country, in order that the real <lb/>
            governor of it might not be brought into disrepute and appear <lb/>
            to have his authority lessened by being apparently disre­ <lb/>
            garded."</p>
          <p>When he heard this he was more indignant than before, and <lb/>
            in public indeed he pretended to be his companion and his <lb/>
            friend, because of his fear of the man who directed his course, <lb/>
            but secretly he bore him much ill-will, and told every one how <lb/>
            he hated him, and abused him behind his back. and insulted <lb/>
            him indirectly, since he did not dare to do so openly ; for he <lb/>
            encouraged the idle and lazy mob of the city (and the mob of <lb/>
            Alexandria is one accustomed to great license of speech, and <note type="footnote"> F 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            one which delights above measure in calumny and evil-speak­ <lb/>
            ing), to abuse the king, either beginning to revile him in his <lb/>
            own person, or else exhorting and exciting others to do so by <lb/>
            the agency of persons who were accustomed to serve him in <lb/>
            business of this kind. And they, having had the cue given <lb/>
            them. spent all their days reviling the king in the public <lb/>
            schools, and stringing together all sorts of gibes to turn him <lb/>
            into ridicule.</p>
          <p>And at times they employed poets who compose farces, and <lb/>
            managers of puppet shows, displaying their natural aptitude <lb/>
            for every kind of disgraceful employment, though they were <lb/>
            very slow at learning anything that was creditable, but very <lb/>
            acute, and quick, and ready at learning anything of an <lb/>
            opposite nature. For why did he not show his indignation, <lb/>
            why did he not commit them to prison, why did he not chas­ <lb/>
            tise them for their insolent and disloyal evil speaking ? And <lb/>
            even if he had not been a king but only one of the household <lb/>
            of Cæsar, ought he not to have had some privileges and espe­ <lb/>
            cial honours ? The fact is that all these circumstances are an <lb/>
            undeniable evidence that Flaccus was a participator in all this <lb/>
            abuse; for he who might have punished it with the most <lb/>
            extreme severity, and entirely checked it, and who yet took no <lb/>
            steps to restrain it, was clearly convicted of having permitted <lb/>
            and encouraged it; but whenever an ungoverned multitude <lb/>
            begins a course of evil doing it never desists, but proceeds <lb/>
            from one wickedness to another, continually doing some <lb/>
            monstrous thing.</p>
          <p>VI. There was a certain madman named Carabbas, afflicted <lb/>
            not with a wild, savage, and dangerous madness (for that comes <lb/>
            on in fits without being expected either by the patient or by <lb/>
            bystanders), but with an intermittent and more gentle kind ; <lb/>
            this man spent all his days and nights naked in the roads, <lb/>
            minding neither cold nor heat, the sport of idle children and <lb/>
            wanton youths ; and they, driving the poor wretch as far as the <lb/>
            public gymnasium, and setting him up there on high that he <lb/>
            might be seen by everybody, flattened out a leaf of papyrus <lb/>
            and put it on his head instead of a diadem, and clothed the <lb/>
            rest of his body with a common door mat instead of a cloak, <lb/>
            and instead of a sceptre they put in his hand a small stick of <lb/>
            the native papyrus which they found lying by the way side and <lb/>
            gave to him; and when, like actors in theatrical spectacles, he <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            had received all the insignia of royal authority, and had been <lb/>
            dressed and adorned like a king, the young men bearing sticks <lb/>
            on their shoulders stood on each side of him instead of spear­ <lb/>
            bearers, in imitation of the body-guards of the king, and then <lb/>
            others came up, some as if to salute him, and others making <lb/>
            as though they wished to plead their causes before him, and <lb/>
            others pretending to wish to consult with him about the affairs <lb/>
            of the state.</p>
          <p>Then from the multitude of those who were standing around <lb/>
            there arose a wonderful shout of men calling out Maris ; and <lb/>
            this is the name by which it is said that they call the kings <lb/>
            among the Syrians ; for they knew that Agrippa was by birth a <lb/>
            Syrian, and also that he was possessed of a great district of Syria <lb/>
            of which he was the sovereign ; when Flaccus heard, or rather <lb/>
            when he saw this, he would have done right if he had appre­ <lb/>
            bended the maniac and put him in prison, that he might not <lb/>
            give to those who reviled him any opportunity or excuse for <lb/>
            insulting their superiors, and if he had chastised those who <lb/>
            dressed him up for having dared both openly and disguisedly, <lb/>
            both with words and actions, to insult a king and a friend of <lb/>
            Cæsar, and one who had been honoured by the Roman senate <lb/>
            with imperial authority; but he not only did not punish them, <lb/>
            but he did not think fit even to check them, but gave complete <lb/>
            license and impunity to all those who designed ill, and who <lb/>
            were disposed to show their enmity and spite to the king, <lb/>
            pretending not to see what he did see, and not to hear what <lb/>
            he did hear.</p>
          <p>And when the multitude perceived this, I do not mean the <lb/>
            ordinary and well-regulated population of the city, but the mob <lb/>
            which, out of its restlessness and love of an unquiet and disor­ <lb/>
            derly life, was always filling every place with tumult and con­ <lb/>
            fusion, and who, because of their habitual idleness and laziness, <lb/>
            were full of treachery and revolutionary plans, they, flocking <lb/>
            to the theatre the first thing in the morning, having already <lb/>
            purchased Flaccus for a miserable price, which he with his <lb/>
            mad desire for glory and with his slavish disposition, conde­ <lb/>
            scended to take to the injury not only of himself, but also of <lb/>
            the safety of the commonwealth, all cried out, as if at a signal <lb/>
            given, to erect images in the synagogues, proposing a most <lb/>
            novel and unprecedented violation of the law.</p>
          <p>And though they knew this (for they are very shrewd in <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            their wickedness), they adopted a deep design, putting forth <lb/>
            the name of Cæsar as a screen, to whom it would be impiety <lb/>
            to attribute the deeds of the guilty; what then did the gover­ <lb/>
            nor of the country do? Knowing that the city had two classes <lb/>
            of inhabitants, our own nation and the people of the country, <lb/>
            and that the whole of Egypt was inhabited in the same man­ <lb/>
            ner, and that Jews who inhabited Alexandria and the rest of <lb/>
            the country from the Catabathmos on the side of Libya to <lb/>
            the boundaries of Ethiopia were not less than a million of <lb/>
            men ; and that the attempts which were being made were <lb/>
            directed against the whole nation, and that it was a most <lb/>
            mischievous thing to distress the ancient hereditary customs <lb/>
            of the land ; he, disregarding all these considerations, permitted <lb/>
            the mob to proceed with the erection of the statues, though <lb/>
            he might have given them a vast number of admonitory pre­ <lb/>
            cepts instead of any such permission, either commanding them <lb/>
            as their governor, or advising them as their friend.</p>
          <p>VII. But he, for he was eagerly co-operating in all that was <lb/>
            being done amiss, thought fit to use his superior power to face <lb/>
            the seditious tumult with fresh additions of evil, and as far as <lb/>
            it depended on him, one may almost say that he filled the <lb/>
            whole of the inhabited world with civil wars ; for it was sum­ <lb/>
            ciently evident that the report about the destruction of the <lb/>
            synagogues, which took its rise in Alexandria would be imme­ <lb/>
            diately spread over all the districts of Egypt, and would <lb/>
            extend from that country to the east and to the oriental <lb/>
            nations, and from the borders of the land in the other direc­ <lb/>
            tion, and from the Mareotic district which is the frontier of <lb/>
            Libya, towards the setting of the sun and the western nations. <lb/>
            For no one country can contain the whole Jewish nation, by <lb/>
            reason of its populousness ; on which account they frequent all <lb/>
            the most prosperous and fertile countries of Europe and Asia, <lb/>
            whether islands or continents, looking indeed upon the holy <lb/>
            city as their metropolis in which is erected the sacred temple <lb/>
            of the most high God, but accounting those regions which <lb/>
            have been occupicd by their fathers, and grandfathers, and <lb/>
            great grandfathers, and still more remote ancestors, in which <lb/>
            they have been born and brought up, as their country; and <lb/>
            there are even some regions to which they came the very <lb/>
            moment that they were originally settled, sending a colony of <lb/>
            their people to do a pleasure to the founders of the colony.</p><pb n="71"/>
            
          <p>And there was reason to fear lest all the populace in every <lb/>
            country, taking what was done in Egypt as a model and as an <lb/>
            excuse, might insult those Jews who were their fellow citizens, <lb/>
            by introducing new regulations with respect to their synagogues <lb/>
            and their national customs; but the Jews, for they were not <lb/>
            inclined to remain quiet under everything, although naturally <lb/>
            entirely disposed towards peace, not only because contests for <lb/>
            natural customs do among all men appear more important than <lb/>
            those which are only for the sake of life, but also because they <lb/>
            alone of all the people under the sun, if they were deprived of <lb/>
            their houses of prayer, would at the same time be deprived of <lb/>
            all means of showing their piety towards their benefactors, <lb/>
            which they would have looked upon as worse than ten thousand <lb/>
            deaths, inasmuch as if their synagogues were destroyed they <lb/>
            would no longer have any sacred places in which they could <lb/>
            declare their gratitude, might have reasonably said to those <lb/>
            who opposed them: You, without being aware of it, are taking <lb/>
            away honour from your lords instead of conferring any on them. <lb/>
            Our houses of prayer are manifestly incitements to all the Jews <lb/>
            in every part of the habitable world to display their piety and <lb/>
            loyalty towards the house of Augustus; and if they are destroyed <lb/>
            from among us, what other place, or what other manner of show­ <lb/>
            in,, that honour, will be left to us ? For if we were to neglect <lb/>
            the opportunity of adhering to our national customs when it <lb/>
            is afforded to us, we should deserve to meet with the severest <lb/>
            punishment, as not giving any proper or adequate return for <lb/>
            the benefits which we have received; but if, while it is in our <lb/>
            power to do so, we, in conformity with our own laws which <lb/>
            Augustus himself is in the habit of confirming, obey in every­ <lb/>
            thing, then I do not see what great, or even what small offence <lb/>
            can be laid to our charge ; unless any one were to impute to <lb/>
            us that we do not transgress the laws of deliberate purpose, <lb/>
            and that we do not intentionally take care to depart from our <lb/>
            national customs, which practices, even if they at first attack <lb/>
            others, do often in the end visit those who are guilty of them.</p>
          <p>But Flaccus, saying nothing that he ought to have said, and <lb/>
            everything which he ought not to have said, has sinned against <lb/>
            us in this manner; but those men whom he has studied to <lb/>
            gratify, what has been their design ? Have they had the feel­ <lb/>
            ings of men wishing to do honour to Csesar ? Was there then <lb/>
            a scarcity of temples in the city, the greatest and most import­ <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            ant parts of which are all allotted to one or other of the gods. <lb/>
            in which they might have erected any statues they pleased ? <lb/>
            We have been describing the evidence of hostile and unfriendly <lb/>
            men, who seek to injure us with such artifice, that even when <lb/>
            injuring us they may not appear to have been acting iniqui <lb/>
            tously, and yet that we who are injured by them cannot resist <lb/>
            with safety to ourselves; for, my good men, it does not con­ <lb/>
            tribute to the honour of the emperor to abrogate the laws, to <lb/>
            disturb the national customs of a people, to insult those who <lb/>
            live in the same country, and to teach those who dwell in other <lb/>
            cities to disregard unanimity and tranquillity.</p>
          <p>VIII. Since, therefore, the attempt which was being made <lb/>
            to violate the law appeared to him to be prospering, while he <lb/>
            was destroying the synagogues, and not leaving even their <lb/>
            name, he proceeded onwards to another exploit, namely, the <lb/>
            utter destruction of our constitution, that when all those things <lb/>
            to which alone our life was anchored were cut away, namely, <lb/>
            our national customs and our lawful political rights and social <lb/>
            privileges, we might be exposed to the very extremity of <lb/>
            calamity, without having any stay left to which we could cling <lb/>
            for safety, for a few days afterwards he issued a notice in which <lb/>
            he called us all foreigners and aliens, without giving us an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of being heard in our own defence, but condemning us <lb/>
            without a trial; and what command can be more full of tyranny <lb/>
            than this ?</p>
          <p>He himself being everything-accuser, enemy, witness, <lb/>
            judge, and executioner, added then to the two former appel­ <lb/>
            lations a third also, allowing any one who was inclined to <lb/>
            proceed to exterminate the Jews as prisoners of war. So when <lb/>
            the people had received this license, what did they do ? There <lb/>
            are five districts in the city, named after the first five letters <lb/>
            of the written alphabet, of these two are called the quarters of <lb/>
            the Jews, because the chief portion of the Jews lives in them. <lb/>
            There are also a few scattered Jews, but only a very few, living <lb/>
            in some of the other districts. What then did they do ? They <lb/>
            drove the Jews entirely out of four quarters, and crammed <lb/>
            them all into a very small portion of one; and by reason of <lb/>
            their numbers they were dispersed over the sea-shore, and <lb/>
            desert places, and among the tombs, being deprived of all their <lb/>
            property; while the populace, overrunning their desolate <lb/>
            houses, turned to plunder, and divided the booty among them­ <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            selves as if they had obtained it in war. And as no one <lb/>
            hindered them, they broke open even the workshops of the <lb/>
            Jews, which were all shut up because of their mourning for <lb/>
            Drusilla,* and carried off all that they found there, and bore <lb/>
            it openly through the middle of the market-place as if they <lb/>
            had only been making use of their own property.</p>
          <p>And the cessation of business to which they were compelled <lb/>
            to submit was even a worse evil than the plunder to which <lb/>
            they were exposed, as the consequence was that those who had <lb/>
            lent money lost what they had lent, and as no one was per­ <lb/>
            mitted, neither farmer, nor captain of a ship, nor merchant, <lb/>
            nor artisan, to employ himself in his usual manner, So that <lb/>
            poverty was brought on them from two sides at once, both from <lb/>
            rapine, as when license was thus given to plunder them they <lb/>
            were stripped of everything in one day, and also from the <lb/>
            circumstance of their no longer being able to earn money by <lb/>
            their customary occupations.</p>
          <p>IX. And though these were evils sufficiently intolerable, <lb/>
            yet nevertheless they appear actually trifling when compared <lb/>
            with those which were subsequently inflicted on them, for <lb/>
            poverty indeed is a bitter evil, especially when it is caused by <lb/>
            the machinations of one's enemies, still it is less than insult <lb/>
            and personal ill treatment even of the slightest character. But <lb/>
            now the evils which were heaped upon our people were so <lb/>
            excessive and inordinate, that if a person were desirous to use <lb/>
            appropriate language, he would never call them insults or <lb/>
            assaults, but, as it appears to me, he-would actually be wholly <lb/>
            at a loss for suitable expressions, on account of the enormity of <lb/>
            the cruelties now newly invented against them, so that if the <lb/>
            treatment which men experience from enemies who have sub­ <lb/>
            dued them in war, however implacable they may be by nature, <lb/>
            were to be compared with that to which the Jews were sub­ <lb/>
            jected, it would appear most merciful. Enemies, indeed, <lb/>
            plunder their conquered foes of their money, and lead away <lb/>
            multitudes in captivity, having incurred the same risk of losing <lb/>
            all that they had if they themselves had been defeated. Not but <lb/>
            that in all such cases there are very many persons for whom <lb/>
            their relations and friends put down a ransom, and who are <lb/>
            thus emancipated from captivity, inasmuch as though their <note type="footnote"> * She was the sister of the emperor, and at her death her brother <lb/>
            ordered that divine honours should be raid to her. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            enemies could not be worked upon by compassion, they could <lb/>
            by love of money.</p>
          <p>But what is the use of going on in this way, some one will <lb/>
            say, for as long as men escape from danger it signifies but little <lb/>
            in what way their preservation is brought to pass ? Moreover, <lb/>
            it has often, happened that enemies have granted to those who <lb/>
            have fallen in battle the honour of funeral rites, those who <lb/>
            were gentle and humane burying them at their own expense, <lb/>
            and those who have carried on their enmity even against the <lb/>
            dead giving up their bodies to their friends under a truce, in <lb/>
            order that they might not be deprived of the last honour of all. <lb/>
            the customary ceremonies of sepulture.</p>
          <p>This, then, is the conduct of enemies in time of war; let us <lb/>
            now see what was done by those who a little while before had <lb/>
            been friends in time of peace.</p>
          <p>For after plundering them of everything, and driving them <lb/>
            from their homes, and expelling them by main force from most <lb/>
            of the quarters of the city, our people, as if they were block­ <lb/>
            aded and hemmed in by a circle of besieging enemies, being <lb/>
            oppressed by a terrible scarcity and want of necessary things, <lb/>
            and seeing their wives and their children dying before their eyes <lb/>
            by an unnatural famine (for every other place was full of pros­ <lb/>
            perity and abundance, as the river had irrigated the corn-lands <lb/>
            plentifully with its inundations, and as all the champaign <lb/>
            country, which is devoted to the purposes of bearing wheat, <lb/>
            was this year supplying a most abundant over-crop of corn with <lb/>
            very unusual 'fertility), being no longer able to support their <lb/>
            want, some, though they had never been used to do so before, <lb/>
            came to the houses of their friends and relations to be,, them <lb/>
            to contribute such food as was absolutely necessary as a <lb/>
            charity; others, who from their high and free-born spirit could <lb/>
            not endure the condition of beggars, as being a slavish state <lb/>
            unbecoming the dignity of a freeman, came down into the <lb/>
            market with no other object than, miserable men that they <lb/>
            were, to buy food for their families and for themselves.</p>
          <p>And then, being immediately seized by those who had excited <lb/>
            the seditious multitude against them, they were treacherously <lb/>
            put to death, and then were dragged along and trampled under <lb/>
            foot by the whole city, and completely destroyed, without the <lb/>
            least portion of them being left which could possibly receive <lb/>
            burial; and in this way their enemies, who in their savage <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            madness had become transformed into the nature of wild beasts, <lb/>
            slew them and thousands of others with all kinds of agony and <lb/>
            tortures, and 'newly invented cruelties, for wherever they met <lb/>
            with or caught sight of a Jew, they stoned him, or beat him <lb/>
            with sticks, not at once delivering their blows upon mortal <lb/>
            parts, lest they should die speedily, and so speedily escape <lb/>
            from the sufferings which it was their design to inflict upon <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Some persons even, going still greater and greater lengths <lb/>
            in the iniquity and license of their barbarity, disdained all <lb/>
            blunter weapons, and took up the most efficacious arms of all, <lb/>
            fire and iron, and slew many with the sword, and destroyed <lb/>
            not a few with flames. And the most merciless of all their <lb/>
            persecutors in some instances burnt whole families, husbands <lb/>
            with their wives, and infant children with their parents, in the <lb/>
            middle of the city, sparing neither age nor youth, nor the <lb/>
            innocent helplessness of infants. And when they had a <lb/>
            scarcity of fuel, they collected faggots of green wood, and slew <lb/>
            them by the smoke rather than by fire, contriving a still more <lb/>
            miserable and protracted death for those unhappy people, so <lb/>
            that their bodies lay about promiscuously in every direction <lb/>
            half burnt, a grievous and most miserable sight.</p>
          <p>And if some of those who were employed in the collection <lb/>
            of sticks were too slow, they took their own furniture, of <lb/>
            which they had plundered them, to burn their persons, robbing <lb/>
            them of their most costly articles, and burning with them <lb/>
            things of the greatest use and value, which they used as fuel <lb/>
            instead of ordinary timber. Many men too, who were alive, <lb/>
            they bound by one foot, fastening them round the ankle, and <lb/>
            thus they dragged them along aDd bruised them, leaping on <lb/>
            them, designing to inflict the most barbarous of deaths upon <lb/>
            them, and then when they were dead they raged no less against <lb/>
            them with interminable hostility, and inflicted still heavier <lb/>
            insults on their persons, dragging them, I had almost said, <lb/>
            through all the alleys and lanes of the city, until the corpse, <lb/>
            being lacerated in all its skin, and flesh, and muscles from the <lb/>
            inequality and roughness of the ground, all the previously <lb/>
            united portions of his composition being torn asunder and <lb/>
            separated from one another, was actually torn to pieces.</p>
          <p>And those who did these things, mimicked the sufferers, <lb/>
            like people employed in the representation of theatrical farces; <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            but the relations and friends of those who were the real <lb/>
            victims, merely because they sympathized with the misery of <lb/>
            their relations, were led away to prison, were scourged, were <lb/>
            tortured, and after all the ill treatment which their living <lb/>
            bodies could endure, found the cross the end of all, and the <lb/>
            punishment from which they could not escape.</p>
          <p>X. But after Flaccus had broken through every right, and <lb/>
            trampled upon every principle of justice, and had left no <lb/>
            portion of the Jews free from the extreme severity of his <lb/>
            designing malice, in the boundlessness of his wickedness he <lb/>
            contrived a monstrous and unprecedented attack upon them, <lb/>
            being ever an inventor of new acts of iniquity, for he arrested <lb/>
            thirty-eight members of our council of elders, which our <lb/>
            saviour and benefactor, Augustus, elected to manage the <lb/>
            affairs of the Jewish nation after the death of the king of our <lb/>
            own nation, having sent written commands to that effect to <lb/>
            Manius Maximus when he was about to take upon himself for <lb/>
            the second time the government of Egypt and of the country, <lb/>
            he arrested them, I say, in their own houses, and commanded <lb/>
            them to be thrown into prison, and arranged a splendid pro­ <lb/>
            cession to send through the middle of the market-place a body <lb/>
            of old men prisoners, with their hands bound, some with thongs <lb/>
            and others with iron chains, whom he led in this plight into <lb/>
            the theatre, a most miserable spectacle, and one wholly <lb/>
            unsuited to the times. And then he commanded them all to <lb/>
            stand in front of their enemies, who were sitting down, to <lb/>
            make their disgrace the more conspicuous, and ordered them <lb/>
            all to be stripped of their clothes and scourged with stripes, in <lb/>
            a way that only the most wicked of malefactors are usually <lb/>
            treated, and they were flogged with such severity that some of <lb/>
            them the moment they were carried out died of their wounds, <lb/>
            while others were rendered so ill for a long time that their <lb/>
            recovery was despaired of.</p>
          <p>And the enormity of this cruelty is proved by many other <lb/>
            circumstances, and it will be further proved most evidently <lb/>
            and undeniably by the circumstance which I am about to <lb/>
            mention. Three of the members of this council of elders, <lb/>
            Euodius, and Trypho, and Audio, had been stripped of all <lb/>
            their property, being plundered of everything that was in their <lb/>
            houses at one onset, and he was well aware that they had been <lb/>
            exposed to this treatment, for it had been related to him when <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            he had in the first instance sent for our rulers, under pretence <lb/>
            of wishing to promote a reconciliation between them and the <lb/>
            rest of the city; but nevertheless, though he well knew that <lb/>
            they had been deprived of all their property, he scourged them <lb/>
            in the very sight of those who had plundered them, that thus <lb/>
            they might endure the twofold misery of poverty and personal <lb/>
            ill treatment, and that their persecutors might reap the double <lb/>
            pleasure of enjoying riches which did in no respect belong to <lb/>
            them, and also of feasting their eyes to satiety on the disgrace <lb/>
            of those whom they had plundered.</p>
          <p>Now, though I desire to mention a circumstance which took <lb/>
            place at that time, I aID in doubt whether to do so or not, lest <lb/>
            if it should be looked upon as unimportant, it may appear to <lb/>
            take off from the enormity of these great iniquities ; but even <lb/>
            if it is unimportant in itself, it is nevertheless an indication <lb/>
            of no trifling wickedness of disposition. There are different <lb/>
            kinds of scourges used in the city, distinguished with reference <lb/>
            to the deserts or crimes of those who are about to be scourged. <lb/>
            Accordingly, it is usual for the Egyptians of the country them­ <lb/>
            selves to be scourged with a different kind of scourge, and by <lb/>
            a different class of executioners, but for the Alexandrians in <lb/>
            the city to be scourged with rods by the Alexandrian lictors, <lb/>
            and this custom had been preserved, in the case also of our <lb/>
            own people, by all the predecessors of Flaccus, and by Flaccus <lb/>
            himself in the earlier periods of his government; for it is pos­ <lb/>
            sible, it really is possible, even in ignominy, to find some <lb/>
            slight circumstance of honour, and even in ill treatment to <lb/>
            find something which is, to some extent, a relaxation, when <lb/>
            any one allows the nature of things to be examined into by <lb/>
            itself, and to be confined to its own indispensable require­ <lb/>
            ments, without adding from his own ingenuity any additional <lb/>
            cruelty or treachery, to separate and take from it all that is <lb/>
            mingled with it of a milder character.</p>
          <p>How then can it be looked upon as anything but most <lb/>
            infamous, that when Alexandrian Jews, of the lowest rank, <lb/>
            had always been previously beaten with the rods, suited to <lb/>
            freemen and citizens, if ever they were convicted of having <lb/>
            done anything worthy of stripes, yet now the very rulers of the <lb/>
            nation, the council of the elders, who derived their very titles <lb/>
            from the honour in which they were held and the offices which <lb/>
            they filled, should, in this respect, be treated with more indig­ <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            nity than their own servants, like the lowest of the Egyptian <lb/>
            rustics, even when found guilty of the very worst of crimes ? <lb/>
            I omit to mention, that even if they had committed the most <lb/>
            countless iniquities, nevertheless the governor ought, out of <lb/>
            respect for the season, to have delayed their punishment; for <lb/>
            with all rulers, who govern any state on constitutional prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, and who do not seek to acquire a character for audacity. <lb/>
            but who do really honour their benefactors, it is the custom <lb/>
            to punish no one, even of those who have been lawfully con­ <lb/>
            demned, until the famous festival and assembly, in honour of <lb/>
            the birth-day of the illustrious emperor, has passed. But he <lb/>
            committed this violation of the laws at the very season of this <lb/>
            festival, and punished men who had done no wrong; though <lb/>
            certainly, if he ever determined to punish them, he ought to <lb/>
            have done so at a subsequent time; but he hastened, and <lb/>
            would admit of no delay, by reason of his eagerness to please <lb/>
            the multitude who was opposed to them, thinking that in this <lb/>
            way he should be able, more easily, to gain them over to the <lb/>
            objects which he had in view.</p>
          <p>I have known instances before now of men who had been <lb/>
            crucified when this festival and holiday was at hand, being <lb/>
            taken down and given up to their relations, in order to receive <lb/>
            the honours of sepulture, and to enjoy such observances as are <lb/>
            due to the dead; for it used to be considered, that even the <lb/>
            dead ought to derive some enjoyment from the natal festival <lb/>
            of a good emperor, and also that the sacred character of the <lb/>
            festival ought to be regarded. But this man did not order <lb/>
            men who had already perished on crosses to be taken down, <lb/>
            but he commanded living men to be crucified, men to whom <lb/>
            the very time itself gave, if not entire forgiveness, still, at all <lb/>
            events, a brief and temporary respite from punishment; and <lb/>
            he did this after they had been beaten by scourgings in the <lb/>
            middle of the theatre; and after he had tortured them with <lb/>
            fire and sword; and the spectacle of their sufferings was <lb/>
            divided; for the first part of the exhibition lasted from the <lb/>
            morning to the third or fourth hour, in which the Jews were <lb/>
            scourged, were hung up, were tortured on the wheel, were con­ <lb/>
            demned, and were dragged to execution through the middle <lb/>
            of the orchestra; and after this beautiful exhibition came the <lb/>
            dancers, and the buffoons, and the flute-players, and all the <lb/>
            other diversions of the theatrical contests.</p><pb n="79"/>
            
          <p>XI. And why do I dwell on these things? for a second <lb/>
            mode of barbarity was afterwards devised against us, because <lb/>
            the governor wished to excite the whole multitude of the army <lb/>
            against us, in accordance with the contrivance of some foreign <lb/>
            informer. Now the information which was laid against the <lb/>
            nation was, that the Jews had entire suits of armour in their <lb/>
            houses; therefore, having sent for a centurion, in whom he <lb/>
            placed the greatest confidence, by name Castor, he ordered <lb/>
            him to take with him the boldest soldier of his own band, to <lb/>
            go with haste, and, without saying a word to any one, to enter <lb/>
            the houses of the Jews, and to search them, and see whether <lb/>
            there was any store of arms laid up in them; and he ran with <lb/>
            great speed to perform the commands which had been given <lb/>
            him. But they, having no suspicion of his intentions, stood <lb/>
            at first speechless with astonishment, their wives and their <lb/>
            children clinging to them, and shedding abundance of tears, <lb/>
            because of their fear of being carried into captivity, for they <lb/>
            were in continual expectation of that, looking upon it as all <lb/>
            that was wanting to complete their total misery. But when <lb/>
            they heard from some of those who were sent to make the <lb/>
            search an inquiry as to where they had laid up their arms, <lb/>
            they breathed awhile, and opening all their secret recesses <lb/>
            displayed everything which they had, being partly delighted <lb/>
            and partly grieving; delighted at the opportunity of repelling <lb/>
            the false accusation which was thus brought against them by <lb/>
            its own character, but indignant, in the first place, because <lb/>
            calumnies of such a nature, when concocted and urged against <lb/>
            them by their enemies, were believed beforehand; and, <lb/>
            secondly, because their wives, who were shut up, and who did <lb/>
            not actually come forth out of their inner chambers, and their <lb/>
            virgins, who were kept in the strictest privacy, shunning the <lb/>
            eyes of men, even of those who were their nearest relations, <lb/>
            out of modesty, were now alarmed by being displayed to the <lb/>
            public gaze, not only of persons who were no relations to them, <lb/>
            but even of common soldiers.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, though a most rigorous examination took place, <lb/>
            how great a quantity of defensive and offensive armour do you <lb/>
            think was found ? Helmets, and breast-plates, and shields, <lb/>
            and daggers, and javelins, and weapons of every description, <lb/>
            were brought out and piled up in heaps ; and also how great a <lb/>
            variety of missile weapons, javelins, slings, bows, and darts ? <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            Absolutely not a single thing of the kind; scarcely even knives <lb/>
            sufficient for the daily use of the cooks to prepare and dress the <lb/>
            food. From which circumstance, the simplicity of their daily <lb/>
            manner of life was plainly seen: as they made no pretence to <lb/>
            magnificence or delicate luxury ; the nature of which things is <lb/>
            to engender satiety, and satiety is apt to engender insolence, <lb/>
            which is the beginning of all evils.</p>
          <p>And indeed it was not a long time before that, that the arms <lb/>
            had been taken away from the Egyptians throughout the whole <lb/>
            country by a man of the name of Bassus, to whom Flaccus had <lb/>
            committed this employment. But at that time one might <lb/>
            have beheld a great fleet of ships sailing down and anchor­ <lb/>
            ing in the harbours afforded by the mouths of the river, <lb/>
            full of arms of every possible description, and numerous beasts <lb/>
            of burden loaded with bags made of skins sewn together and <lb/>
            hanging like panniers on each side so as to balance better, and <lb/>
            also almost all the waggons belonging to the camp filled with <lb/>
            weapons of every sort, whicn were brought in rows so as to be <lb/>
            all seen at once, and arranged together in order. And the <lb/>
            distance between the harbour and the armoury in. the king's <lb/>
            palace in which the arms were commanded to be deposited was <lb/>
            about ten stadia; it was then very proper to investigate the <lb/>
            houses of the men who had amassed such quantities of arms; <lb/>
            for as they had often actually revolted, they were naturally <lb/>
            liable to be suspected of designing revolutionary measures, and <lb/>
            it was quite fitting that, in imitation of the sacred games, those <lb/>
            who had superintended the collection of the arms should keep <lb/>
            a new triennial festival in Egypt, in order that they might not <lb/>
            again be collected without any one being aware of it, or else <lb/>
            that at all events only a few might be collected instead of a <lb/>
            great number, from the people not having time enough to <lb/>
            assemble any great number.</p>
          <p>But why were we to be exposed to any treatment of the sort ? <lb/>
            For when were we ever suspected of any tendency to revolt ? <lb/>
            And when did we bear any other than a most peaceful charac­ <lb/>
            ter among all men ? And the habits in which we daily and <lb/>
            habitually indulge, are they not irreproachable, tending to the <lb/>
            lawful tranquillity and stability of the state ? In fact, if the <lb/>
            Jews had had arms in their houses, would they have submitted <lb/>
            to be stripped of above four hundred dwellings, out of which <lb/>
            they were turned and forcibly expelled by those who plundered <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            them of all their properties ? Why then was not this search <lb/>
            made in the houses of those people who had arms, if not of <lb/>
            their own private property, at all events such as they had car­ <lb/>
            ried off from others ?</p>
          <p>The truth is, as I have said already, the whole business was <lb/>
            a deliberate contrivance designed by the cruelty ofFlaccus and <lb/>
            of the multitude, in which even women were included; for <lb/>
            they were dragged away as captives, not only in the market- <lb/>
            place, but even in the middle of the theatre, and dragged upon <lb/>
            the stage on any false accusation that might be brought against <lb/>
            them with the most painful and intolerable insults; and then, <lb/>
            when it was found that they were of another race, they were <lb/>
            dismissed; for they apprehended many women as Jewesses <lb/>
            who were not so, from want of making any careful or accurate <lb/>
            investigation. And if they appeared to belong to our nation, <lb/>
            then those who, instead of spectators, became tyrants and mas­ <lb/>
            ters, laid cruel commands on them, bringing them swine's flesh, <lb/>
            and enjoining them to eat it Accordingly, all who were <lb/>
            wrought on by fear of punishment to eat it were released <lb/>
            without suffering any ill treatment; but those who were more <lb/>
            obstinate were given up to the tormentors to suffer intole­ <lb/>
            rable tortures, which is the clearest of all possible proofs that <lb/>
            they had committed no offence whatever beyond what I have <lb/>
            mentioned.</p>
          <p>XII. But it was not out of his own head alone, but also <lb/>
            because of the commands and in consequence of the situation <lb/>
            of the emperor that he sought and devised means to injure and <lb/>
            oppress us; for after we had decreed by our votes and carried <lb/>
            out by our actions all the honours to the emperor Caius, which <lb/>
            were either within our power or allowable by our laws, we <lb/>
            brought the decree to him, entreating him that, as it was not <lb/>
            permitted to us to send an embassy ourselves to bear it to the <lb/>
            emperor, he would vouchsafe to forward it himself. And, after <lb/>
            he had read all the articles contained in the decree, and having <lb/>
            often nodded his head in token of his approbation of them, <lb/>
            smiling, and being very much delighted, or else pretending to <lb/>
            be pleased, he said: " I approve of you very greatly in all <lb/>
            things, for your piety and loyalty, and I will forward it as you <lb/>
            request, or else I myself will act the part of your ambassador, <lb/>
            that Caius may be aware of your gratitude. And I myself <lb/>
            will bear witness in your favour to all that I know of the <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV </note> <note type="footnote"> G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            orderly disposition and obedient character of your nation, with­ <lb/>
            out exaggerating anything ; for truth is the most sufficient of <lb/>
            all panegyrics."</p>
          <p>At these promises we were greatly delighted, and we gave <lb/>
            him thanks, hoping that the decree would be thoroughly read <lb/>
            and appreciated by Caius. And indeed it was natural enough, <lb/>
            since all the things that are promptly and carefully sent by <lb/>
            the lieutenant-governors are read and examined without delay by <lb/>
            you; but Flaccus, wholly neglecting all our hopes, and all his <lb/>
            own words, and all his own promises, retained the decree, in <lb/>
            order that you, above all the men under the sun, might be <lb/>
            looked upon as enemies to the emperor.</p>
          <p>Was not this the conduct of one who had been vigilant afar <lb/>
            off, and who had long been contriving his design against us, <lb/>
            and who was not now yielding to some momentary impulse, <lb/>
            and attacking us on a sudden without any previous contrivance <lb/>
            with unreasonable impetuosity, being led away by some fresh <lb/>
            motive? But God, as it seems, he who has a care for all <lb/>
            human affairs, scattered his flattering speeches cunningly <lb/>
            devised to mislead the emperor, and baffled the counsels of <lb/>
            his lawless disposition and the manoeuvres which he was em­ <lb/>
            ploying, taking pity on us, and very soon he brought matters <lb/>
            into such a train that Flaccus was disappointed of his hopes.</p>
          <p>For when Agrippa, the king, came into the country, we set <lb/>
            before him all the designs which Flaccus had entertained <lb/>
            against us; and he set himself to rectify the business, and, <lb/>
            having promised to forward the decree to the emperor, he <lb/>
            taking it, as we hear, did send it, accompanied with a defence <lb/>
            relating to the time at which it was passed, showing that it was <lb/>
            not lately only that we had learnt to venerate the family of our <lb/>
            benefactors, but that we had from the very first beginning <lb/>
            shown our zeal towards them, though we had been deprived of <lb/>
            the opportunity of making any seasonable demonstration of it <lb/>
            by the insolence of our governor. And after these events <lb/>
            justice, the constant champion and ally of those who are <lb/>
            injured, and the punisher of everything impious, whether it be <lb/>
            action or man, began to labour to work his overthrow. For at <lb/>
            first they endured the most unexampled insults and miseries, <lb/>
            such as had never happened under any other of our governors, <lb/>
            ever since the house of Augustus first acquired the dominion <lb/>
            over earth and sea; for some men of those who, in the time of <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            Tiberius, and of Cæsar his father, had the government, seeking <lb/>
            to convert their governorship and viceroyalty into a sovereignty <lb/>
            and tyranny, filled all the country with intolerable evils, with <lb/>
            corruption, and rapine, and condemnation of persons who had <lb/>
            done no wrong, and with banishment and exile of such innocent <lb/>
            men, and with the slaughter of the nobles without a trial; and <lb/>
            then, after the appointed period of their government had <lb/>
            expired, when they returned to Rome, the emperors exacted of <lb/>
            them an accpunt and relation of all that they had done, <lb/>
            especially if by chance the cities which they had been oppressing <lb/>
            sent any embassy to complain ; for then the emperors, behaving <lb/>
            like impartial judges, listening both to the accusers and to the <lb/>
            defendant on equal terms, not thinking it right to fire-judge <lb/>
            and pre-condemn anyone before his trial, decided without being <lb/>
            influenced either by enmity or favour, but according to the <lb/>
            nature of truth, and pronouncing such a judgment as seemed to <lb/>
            be just. But in the case of Flaccus, that justice which hates <lb/>
            iniquity did not wait till the term of his government had <lb/>
            expired, but went forward to meet him before the usual time, <lb/>
            being indignant at the immoderate extravagance of his lawless <lb/>
            iniquity.</p>
          <p>XIII. And the manner in which lie was cut short in his <lb/>
            tyranny was as follows. He imagined that Caius was already <lb/>
            made favourable to him in respect of those matters, about which <lb/>
            suspicion was sought to be raised against him, partly by his <lb/>
            letters which were full of flattery, and partly by the harangues <lb/>
            which he was continually addressing to the people, in which he <lb/>
            courted the emperor by stringing together flattering sentences <lb/>
            and long series of cunningly imagined panegyrics, and partly <lb/>
            too because he was very highly thought of by the greater part of <lb/>
            the city. But he was deceiving himself without knowing it; <lb/>
            for the hopes of wicked men are unstable, as they guess what is <lb/>
            more favourable to them while they suffer what is quite contrary <lb/>
            to it, as in fact they deserve. J</p>
          <p>For Bassus, the centurion, was sent from Italy by the <lb/>
            appointment of Caius with the company of soldiers which lie <lb/>
            commanded. And having embarked on board one of the fastest <lb/>
            sailing vessels, he arrived in a few days at the harbour of <lb/>
            Alexandria, off the island of Pharos, about evening; and he <lb/>
            ordered the captain of the ship to keep out in the open sea till <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="84"/>
            sunset, intending to enter the city unexpectedly, in order that <lb/>
            Flaccus might not be aware of his coming beforehand, and so be <lb/>
            led to adopt any violent measures, and render the service which <lb/>
            he was commanded to perform fruitless.</p>
          <p>And when the evening came, the ship entered the harbour, <lb/>
            and Bassus, disembarking with his own soldiers, advanced, <lb/>
            neither recognizing nor being recognized by any one ; and on <lb/>
            his road finding a soldier who was one of the quaternions of the <lb/>
            guard, he ordered him to show him the house of his captain; <lb/>
            for he wished to communicate his secret errand to him, that, if <lb/>
            he required additional force, he might have an assistant ready.</p>
          <p>And when he heard that he was supping at some person's <lb/>
            house in company with Flaccus, he did not relax in his speed, <lb/>
            but hastened onward to the dwelling of his entertainer; for <lb/>
            the man with whom they were feasting was Stephanion, one of <lb/>
            the freedmen of Tiberius Csesar; and withdrawing to a short <lb/>
            distance, he sends forward one of his own followers to recon­ <lb/>
            noitre, disguising him like a servant in order that no one might <lb/>
            notice him or perceive what was going forward. So he, <lb/>
            entering in to the banqueting-room, as if he were the servant <lb/>
            of one of the guests, examined everything accurately, and then <lb/>
            returned and gave information to Bassus. And he, when he <lb/>
            had learnt the unguarded condition of the entrances, and the <lb/>
            small number of the people who were with Flaccus (for he was <lb/>
            attended by not more than ten or fifteen slaves to wait upon <lb/>
            him), gave the signal to his soldiers whom he had with him, <lb/>
            and hastened forward, and entered suddenly into the supper­ <lb/>
            room, he and the soldiers with him, who stood by with their <lb/>
            swords girded on, and surrounded Flaccus before he was aware <lb/>
            of it, for at the moment of their entrance he was drinking <lb/>
            health with some one, and making merry with those who were <lb/>
            present.</p>
          <p>But when Bassus had made his way into the midst, the <lb/>
            moment that he saw him he became dumb with amazement <lb/>
            and consternation, and wishing to rise up he saw the guards <lb/>
            all round him, and then he perceived his fate, even before he <lb/>
            heard what Caius wanted with him, and what commands had <lb/>
            been given to those who had come, and what he was about to <lb/>
            endure, for the mind of man is very prompt at perceiving at <lb/>
            once all those particulars which take a long time to happen, <lb/>
            and at hearing them all together. Accordingly, every one of <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            those who were of this supper party rose up, being through <lb/>
            fear unnerved, and shuddering lest some punishment might <lb/>
            be affixed to the mere fact of having been supping with the <lb/>
            culprit, for it was not safe to flee, nor indeed was it possible to <lb/>
            do so, since all the entrances were already occupied. So <lb/>
            Flaccus was led away by the soldiers at the command of <lb/>
            Bassus, this being the manner in which he returned from the <lb/>
            banquet, for it was fitting that justice should begin to visit him <lb/>
            at a feast, because he had deprived the houses of innumerable <lb/>
            innocent men of all festivity.</p>
          <p>XIV. This was the unexampled misfortune which befell <lb/>
            Flaccus in the country of which he was governor, being taken <lb/>
            prisoner like an enemy on account of the Jews, as it appears <lb/>
            to me, whom he had determined to destroy utterly in his desire <lb/>
            for glory. And a manifest proof of this is to be found in the <lb/>
            time of his arrest, for it was the general festival of the Jews at <lb/>
            the time of the autumnal equinox, during which it is the custom <lb/>
            of the Jews to live in tents ; but none of the usual customs at <lb/>
            this festival were carried out at all, since all the rulers of the <lb/>
            people were still oppressed by irremediable and intolerable <lb/>
            injuries and insults, and since the common people looked upon <lb/>
            the miseries of their chiefs as the common calamity of the <lb/>
            whole nation, and were also depressed beyond measure at the <lb/>
            individual afflictions to which they were each of them sepa­ <lb/>
            rately exposed, for griefs are redoubled when they happen at <lb/>
            the times of festival, when those who are afflicted are unable <lb/>
            to keep the feast, both by reason of the deprivation of their <lb/>
            mirthful cheerfulness, which a general assembly requires, and <lb/>
            also from the presence of sorrow by which they were now over­ <lb/>
            come, without being able to find any remedy for such terrible <lb/>
            disasters.</p>
          <p>And while they were yielding to excessive sorrow, and feel­ <lb/>
            ing overwhelmed by most severe anguish, and they were all <lb/>
            collected in their houses at the approach of night, some persons <lb/>
            came in to inform them of the apprehension of the governor <lb/>
            which had then taken place. And they thought that this was <lb/>
            to try them, and was not the truth, and were grieved all the <lb/>
            more from thinking themselves mobbed, and that a snare was <lb/>
            thus laid for them; but when a tumult arose through the city, <lb/>
            and the guards of the night began to run about to and fro, and <lb/>
            when some of the cavalry were heard to be galloping with the <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            utmost speed and with all energy to the camp and from the <lb/>
            camp, some of them, being excited by the strangeness of the <lb/>
            event, went forth from their houses to inquire what had <lb/>
            happened, for it was plain that something strange had occurred. <lb/>
            And when they heard of the arrest that had taken place, and <lb/>
            that Flaccus was now within the toils, stretching up their <lb/>
            hands to heaven, they sang a hymn, and began a song of praise <lb/>
            to God, who presides over all the affairs of men, saying, " We <lb/>
            are not delighted, 0 Master, at the punishment of our enemy, <lb/>
            being taught by the sacred laws to submit to all the vicissi­ <lb/>
            tudes of human life, but we justly give thanks to thee, who <lb/>
            hast had mercy and compassion upon us, and who hast thus <lb/>
            relieved our continual and incessant oppressions."</p>
          <p>And when they had spent the whole night in hymns and <lb/>
            songs, they poured out through the gates at the earliest dawn, <lb/>
            and hastened to the nearest point of the shore, for they had <lb/>
            been deprived of their usual places for prayer, and standing in <lb/>
            a clear and open space, they cried out, " 0 most mighty King <lb/>
            of all mortal and immortal beings, we have come to offer thanks <lb/>
            unto thee, to invoke earth and sea, and the air and the heaven, <lb/>
            and all the parts of the universe, and the whole world in which <lb/>
            alone we dwell, being driven out by men and robbed of every­ <lb/>
            thing else in the world, and being deprived of our city,and of <lb/>
            all the buildings both private and public within the city, and <lb/>
            being made houseless and homeless by the treachery of our <lb/>
            governor, the only men in the world who are so treated. You <lb/>
            suggest to us favourable hopes of the setting straight of what <lb/>
            is left to us, beginning to consent to our prayers, inasmuch as <lb/>
            you have on a sudden thrown down the common enemy of our <lb/>
            nation, the author and cause of all our calamities, exulting in <lb/>
            pride, and trusting that he would gain credit by such means, <lb/>
            before he was removed to a distance from us, in order that <lb/>
            those who were evilly afflicted might not feel their joy impaired <lb/>
            by learning it only by report, but you have chastised him while <lb/>
            lie was so near, almost as we may say before the eyes of those <lb/>
            whom he oppressed, in order to give us a more distinct per­ <lb/>
            ception of the end which has fallen upon him in a short time <lb/>
            beyond our hopes."</p>
          <p>XV. And besides what I have spoken of there is also a <lb/>
            third thing, which appears to me to have taken place by the <lb/>
            interposition of divine providence; for after he had set sail at <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            the beginning of winter, for it was rightly ordained that he <lb/>
            should have his fill of the dangers of the sea, inasmuch as he <lb/>
            had filled all the elements of the universe with his impieties, <lb/>
            after suffering innumerable hardships he with difficulty got <lb/>
            safely to Italy, and the moment that he had arrived there he <lb/>
            was pursued by accusations which were brought against him, <lb/>
            and which were brought before two of his greatest enemies, <lb/>
            Isidorus and Lampo, who a little while before were in the <lb/>
            position of subjects to him, calling him their master, and bene­ <lb/>
            factor, and saviour, and names of that sort, but who now were <lb/>
            his adversaries, and that too displaying a power not only equal <lb/>
            to but far superior to his own, not merely from the confidence <lb/>
            which men feel in the justice of their cause, but, what was a <lb/>
            matter of great moment, because they saw that the Judge of <lb/>
            all human affairs was his irreconcileable enemy, being about <lb/>
            now to take upon himself the form of a judge from a prudent <lb/>
            determination not to appear to condemn any one beforehand <lb/>
            unheard, and not to act the part of an enemy, who before <lb/>
            hearing either accusation or defence, has already condemned <lb/>
            the defendant in his mind, and has sentenced him to the most <lb/>
            severe punishments. But nothing is so terrible as for men <lb/>
            who have been the more powerful to be accused by their <lb/>
            inferiors, and for those who have been rulers to be impeached <lb/>
            by their former subjects, which is as if masters were being <lb/>
            prosecuted by their natural or purchased slaves.</p>
          <p>XVI. And yet even this in my opinion was a lighter evil <lb/>
            when compared with another which was greater still; for it <lb/>
            was not people who were merely in the simple rank of subjects <lb/>
            who now, discarding that position and conspiring together, on a <lb/>
            sudden attacked him with their accusations; but those who did <lb/>
            so were men who during the chief part of the time that he had <lb/>
            had the government of the courtry had been in a position of <lb/>
            the greatest enmity and hatred to him, Lampo having been <lb/>
            under a prosecution for impiety against Tiberius Cæsar, and <lb/>
            having been almost worn out by the matter which had been <lb/>
            thus impending over his head for two years; for the judge <lb/>
            who had a grudge against him caused all sorts of delays and <lb/>
            every possible protraction of the cause on various pretexts, <lb/>
            wishing even if he escaped from the accusation, at all events to <lb/>
            keep the terror of the future as uncertain hanging over his head <lb/>
            for the longest possible period, so as to make his life more <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            miserable even than death. And then again when he seemed <lb/>
            to have come off victorious, saying that he was insulted and <lb/>
            injured in his property (for he was compelled to become a <lb/>
            gymnasiarch), either by being economical and illiberal in his <lb/>
            expenses, pretending that he had not sufficient wealth for such <lb/>
            unlimited expenditure, or perhaps really not having enough; <lb/>
            but before he came to the trial, making a parade of being very <lb/>
            rich, but when he did come to the proof then appearing not to <lb/>
            be a man of exceeding wealth, having acquired nearly all the <lb/>
            riches which he had by unjust actions.</p>
          <p>For standing by the rulers when they gave judgment, he <lb/>
            took notes of all that took place on the trial as if he were a <lb/>
            clerk; and then he designedly passed over or omitted such and <lb/>
            such points, and interpolated other things which were not said. <lb/>
            And at times, too, he made alterations, changing and altering. <lb/>
            and perverting matters, and turning things up-side down, aim­ <lb/>
            ing to get money by every syllable, or, I might rather say, by <lb/>
            every letter, like a hunter after musty records, whom the whole <lb/>
            people with one accord did often with great felicity and pro­ <lb/>
            priety of expression call a pen-murderer, as slaying numbers of <lb/>
            persons by the things which he wrote, and rendering the living <lb/>
            more miserable than even the dead, as, though they might have <lb/>
            got the victory and been in comfort, they were subjected to <lb/>
            miserable defeat and poverty, their enemies having bought <lb/>
            victory, and triumph, and wealth, of a man who sold and made <lb/>
            his market of the properties of others.</p>
          <p>For it was impossible for rulers who had the charge of so <lb/>
            vast a country entrusted to them, when affairs of every sort, both <lb/>
            private and public, were coming in upon them fresh every day, <lb/>
            to remember everything which they had heard, especially as <lb/>
            they had not only to fill the part of judges, but also to take <lb/>
            accounts of all the revenues and taxes, the investigation into <lb/>
            which occupied the greater portion of the year. And the man <lb/>
            to whom it was entrusted to take charge of that most im­ <lb/>
            portant of all deposits, namely, justice, and of those most holy <lb/>
            sentiments which had been delivered and urged before them, <lb/>
            caused forgetfulness to the judges, registering those who ought <lb/>
            to have had sentence in their favour as defeated, and those <lb/>
            who ought to have been defeated as victorious, after the receipt <lb/>
            of his accursed pay, or, to speak more properly, wages of <lb/>
            iniquity.</p><pb n="89"/>
            
          <p>XVII. Such, then, was the character of Lampo, who was <lb/>
            now one of the accusers of Flaccus.</p>
          <p>And Isidorus was in no respect inferior to him in wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, being a man of the populace, a low demagogue, one who <lb/>
            had continually studied to throw everything into disorder and <lb/>
            confusion, an enemy to all peace and stability, very clever at <lb/>
            exciting seditions and tumults which had no existence before, <lb/>
            and at inflaming and exaggerating such as were already ex­ <lb/>
            cited, taking care always to keep about him a disorderly and <lb/>
            promiscuous mob of all the refuse of the people, ready for every <lb/>
            kind of atrocity, which he had divided into regular sections as <lb/>
            so many companies of soldiers.</p>
          <p>There are a vast number of parties in the city whose associ­ <lb/>
            ation is founded in no one good principle, but who are united <lb/>
            by wine, and drunkenness, and revelry, and the offspring of <lb/>
            those indulgencies, insolence; and their meetings are called <lb/>
            synods and couches by the natives. In all these parties or <lb/>
            the greater number of them Isidorus is said to have borne the <lb/>
            bell, the leader of the feast, the chief of the supper, the dis­ <lb/>
            turber of the city. Then, whenever it was determined to do <lb/>
            some mischief, at one signal they all went forth in a body, and <lb/>
            did and said whatever they were told. And on one occasion, <lb/>
            being indignant with Flaccus because, after he had appeared <lb/>
            originally to be a person of some weight with him, he after­ <lb/>
            wards was no longer courted in an equal degree, having hired a <lb/>
            gang of fellows from the training schools and men accustomed <lb/>
            to vociferate loudly, who sell their outcries as if in regular <lb/>
            market to those who are inclined to buy them, he ordered <lb/>
            them all to assemble at the gymnasium ; and they, having <lb/>
            filled it, began to heap accusations on Flaccus without any <lb/>
            particular grounds, inventing all kinds of monstrous accu­ <lb/>
            sations and all sorts of falsehoods in ridiculous language, <lb/>
            stringing long sentences together, so that not only was Flaccus <lb/>
            himself alarmed but all the others who were there at this un­ <lb/>
            expected attack, and especially, as it may be conjectured, from <lb/>
            the idea that there must certainly have been some one <lb/>
            behind the scenes whom they were studying to gratify, since <lb/>
            they themselves had suffered no evil, and since they were well <lb/>
            aware that the rest of the city had not been ill-treated by <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Then, after they had deliberated awhile, they determined to <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            apprehend certain persons of them and to inquire into the <lb/>
            cause of this indiscriminate and sudden rage and madness. <lb/>
            And the men who were arrested, without being put to the tor­ <lb/>
            ture, confessed the truth and added proofs to their words by <lb/>
            what had been done, detailing the pay which had been agreed <lb/>
            to be given to them, both that which had been already given <lb/>
            and that which, in accordance with his promises, was subse­ <lb/>
            quently to be paid, and the men who were appointed to <lb/>
            distribute it as the leaders of the sedition, and the place where <lb/>
            it was to break out, and the time when the giving of the <lb/>
            bribes was to take place.</p>
          <p>And when every one, as was very natural, was indignant at <lb/>
            this, and when the city was mightily offended, that the folly of <lb/>
            some individuals should attach to it so as to dim its reputa­ <lb/>
            tion, Flaccus determined to send for some of the most honour­ <lb/>
            able men of the people, and, on the next day to bring forward <lb/>
            before them those who had distributed the bribes, that he might <lb/>
            investigate the truth about Isidorus, and also that he might <lb/>
            make a defence of his own system of government, and prove <lb/>
            that he had been unjustly calumniated ; and when they heard <lb/>
            the proclamation there came not only the magistrates but <lb/>
            also the whole city, except that portion which was about to be <lb/>
            convicted of having been the agents of corruption or the <lb/>
            corrupted.</p>
          <p>And they who had been employed in this honourable service, <lb/>
            being raised up on the platform, that they might be elevated <lb/>
            and conspicuous and be recognised by all men, accused <lb/>
            Isidorus as having been the cause of all the tumults and of <lb/>
            the accusations which had been brought against Flaccus, and <lb/>
            as having given money and bribes to no small number of them <lb/>
            by himself. " Since else," said they, " where could we have <lb/>
            got such great abundance ? We are poor men, and are scarcely <lb/>
            able to provide our daily expenses for absolute necessaries; <lb/>
            and what evil did we ever suffer from the governor, so as to be <lb/>
            forced to bear him ill will? Nay, but it is he who was the <lb/>
            cause of all these things, the author of them all, he who is <lb/>
            always envious of those who are in prosperity, -and an adver­ <lb/>
            sary of all stability and wholesome law."</p>
          <p>And when those who were present came to the knowledge <lb/>
            of these things, for what was thus said was a very evident <lb/>
            proof and evidence of the intentions of the person accused, <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            they all raised an outcry, some calling out that he should be <lb/>
            degraded, others that he should be banished, others that he <lb/>
            should be put to death, and these last were the most nu­ <lb/>
            merous ; and the others changed their tone and joined them, <lb/>
            so that at last they all cried out, with one accord and with one <lb/>
            voice, to slay the common pest of the laud, the man to whom <lb/>
            it was owing that, ever since he had arrived in the country <lb/>
            and taken any part in public affairs, no part of the city or of <lb/>
            the common interests had ever been left in a sound or healthy <lb/>
            condition; and he, indeed, being convicted by his conscience, <lb/>
            fled away in-doors, fearing lest he should be seized; but <lb/>
            Flaccus did nothing against him, thinking that now that he <lb/>
            had voluntarily removed himself, everything in the city would <lb/>
            soon be free from sedition and contention.</p>
          <p>XVIII. I have related these events at some length, not for <lb/>
            the sake of keeping old injuries in remembrance, but because <lb/>
            I admire that power who presides over all freemen's affairs, <lb/>
            namely, justice, seeing that those men who were so generally <lb/>
            hostile to Flaccus, those by whom of all men he was most <lb/>
            hated, were the men who now brought their accusations <lb/>
            against him, to fill up the measure of his grief, for it is not so <lb/>
            bitter merely to be accused as to be accused by one's confessed <lb/>
            enemies; but this mail was not merely accused, though a go­ <lb/>
            vernor, by his subjects, and that by men who had always been <lb/>
            his enemies, when he had only a short time before been the <lb/>
            lord of the life of every individual among them, but he was <lb/>
            also apprehended by force, being thus subjected to a. twofold <lb/>
            evil, namely, to be defeated and ridiculed by exulting enemies, <lb/>
            which is worse than death to all right-minded and sensible <lb/>
            people.</p>
          <p>And then see what an abundance of disasters came upon <lb/>
            him, for he was immediately stripped of all his possessions, <lb/>
            both of those which he inherited from his parents and of all <lb/>
            that he had acquired himself, having been a man who took <lb/>
            especial delight in luxury and ornament; for he was not like <lb/>
            some rich men, to whom wealth is an inactive material, but he <lb/>
            was continually acquiring things of every useful kind in <lb/>
            all imaginable abundance; cups, garments, couches, minia­ <lb/>
            tures, and everything else which was any ornament to a house; <lb/>
            and besides that, he collected a vast number of servants, care­ <lb/>
            fully selected for their excellencies and accomplishments, and <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            with reference to their beauty, and health, and vigour of body, <lb/>
            and to their unerring skill in all kinds of necessary and use­ <lb/>
            ful service; for every one of them was excellent in that employ­ <lb/>
            ment to which he was appointed, so that he was looked upon <lb/>
            as either the most excellent of all servants in that place, or, at <lb/>
            all events, as inferior to no one.</p>
          <p>And there is a very clear proof of this in the fact that, <lb/>
            though there were a vast number of properties confiscated and <lb/>
            sold for the public benefit, which belonged to persons who had <lb/>
            been condemned, that of Flaccus alone was assigned to the <lb/>
            emperor, with perhaps one or two more, in order that the law <lb/>
            which had been established with respect to persons convicted <lb/>
            of such crimes as his might not be violated.</p>
          <p>And after he had been deprived of all his property, he was <lb/>
            condemned to banishment, and was exiled from the whole <lb/>
            continent, and that is the greatest and most excellent portion <lb/>
            of the inhabited world, and from every island that has any <lb/>
            character for fertility or richness; for he was commanded to <lb/>
            be sent into that most miserable of all the islands in the <lb/>
            Ægæan Sea,* called Gyara, and he would have been left there <lb/>
            if he had not availed himself of the intercession of Lepidus, by <lb/>
            whose means he obtained leave to exchange Gyara for Andros, <lb/>
            which was very near it. Then he was sent back again on the <lb/>
            road from Rome to Brundusium, a journey which he had taken <lb/>
            a few years before, at the time when he was appointed governor <lb/>
            of Egypt and the adjacent country of Lybia, in order that the <lb/>
            cities which had then seen him exulting and behaving with <lb/>
            great insolence in the hour of his prosperity, might now again <lb/>
            behold him full of dishonour. And thus he being now become <lb/>
            a conspicuous mark by reason of this total change of fortune, <lb/>
            was overwhelmed with more bitter grief, his calamities being <lb/>
            constantly re-kindled and inflamed by the addition of fresh <lb/>
            miseries, which, like relapses in sickness, compel the recol­ <lb/>
            lection of all former disasters to return, which up to that time <lb/>
            appeared to be buried in obscurity.'</p>
          <p>XIX. And after he bad crossed the Ionian Gulf he sailed <lb/>
            up the sea which leads to Corinth, being a spectacle to all the <note type="footnote"> * This was a common place of banishment for criminals. Juvenal <lb/>
            says — <lb/>

            cities in Peloponnesus which lie on the coast, when they heard <lb/>
            of his sudden reverse of fortune; for when he disembarked <lb/>
            from the vessel all the evil disposed men who bore him ill will <lb/>
            ran up to see him, and others also came to sympathize with <lb/>
            him—men who are accustomed to learn moderation from the <lb/>
            misfortunes of others. And at Lechæum, crossing over the <lb/>
            isthmus into the opposite gulf, and having arrived at Cenchreæ, <lb/>
            the dockyard of the Corinthians, he was compelled by the <lb/>
            guards, who would not permit him the slightest respite, to <lb/>
            embark immediately on board a small transport and to set sail, <lb/>
            and as a foul wind was blowing with great violence, after great <lb/>
            sufferings he with difficulty arrived safe at the Piræus.</p>
          <p>And when the storm had ceased, having coasted along <lb/>
            Attica as far as the promontory of Sunium,* he passed by all <lb/>
            the islands in order, namely, Helena, and Ceanus, and Cythnos, <lb/>
            and all the rest which lie in a regular row one after another, <lb/>
            until at last he came to the point of his ultimate destination, <lb/>
            the island of Andros, which the miserable man beholding afar <lb/>
            off poured forth abundance of tears down his cheeks, as if from <lb/>
            a regular fountain, and beating his breast, and lamenting most <lb/>
            bitterly, he said, " Men, ye who are my guards and attendants <lb/>
            in this my journey, I now -eceive in exchange for the glorious <lb/>
            Italy this beautiful country of Andros, which is an unfortunate <lb/>
            island for me. I, Flaccus, who was born, and brought up, and <lb/>
            educated in Rome, the heaven of the world, and who have been <lb/>
            the schoolfellow and companion of the granddaughters of <lb/>
            Augustus, and who was afterwards selected by Tiberius Cæsar <lb/>
            as one of his most intimate friends, and who have had entrusted <lb/>
            to me for six years the greatest of all his possessions, namely, <lb/>
            Egypt. What a change is this ! In the middle of the day, <lb/>
            as if an eclipse had come upon me, night has overshadowed <lb/>
            my life. What shall I say of this little islet ? Shall I call <lb/>
            it my place of banishment, or my new country, or harbour and <lb/>
            refuge of misery ? A tomb would be the most proper name for <lb/>
            it; for I, miserable that I am, am now in a manner conducted <lb/>
            to my grave, attending my own funeral, for either I shall <lb/>
            destroy my miserable life through my sorrow, or if I am able <lb/>
            to cling to life among my miseries, I shall in that case find a <lb/>
            distant death, which will be felt all the time of my life."</p>
          <p>These, then, were the lamentations which he poured forth, <note type="footnote"> * Now Cape Colonna. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            and when the vessel came near the harbour he landed, stoop­ <lb/>
            ing down to the very ground like men heavily oppressed, being <lb/>
            weighed down by his calamities as if the heaviest of burdens <lb/>
            was placed upon his neck, without being able to look up, or <lb/>
            else not daring to do so because of the people whom be <lb/>
            might meet, and of those who came out to see him and who <lb/>
            stood on each side of the road. And those men who had <lb/>
            conducted him hither, bringing the populace of the Andrians, <lb/>
            exhibited him to them all, making them all witnesses of the <lb/>
            arrival of the exile in their island.</p>
          <p>And they, when they had discharged their office, departed; <lb/>
            and then the misery of Flaccus was renewed, as he no longer <lb/>
            beheld any sight to which he was accustomed, but only saw <lb/>
            sad misery presented to him by the most conspicuous evidence, <lb/>
            while he looked around upon what to him was perfect desola­ <lb/>
            tion, in the middle of which he was placed ; so that it seemed <lb/>
            to him that a violent execution in his native land would have <lb/>
            been a lighter evil, or rather, by comparison with his present <lb/>
            circumstances, a most desirable good; and he gave himself up <lb/>
            to such violence of grief, that he was in no respect different <lb/>
            from a maniae, and leaped about, and ran to and fro, and <lb/>
            clapped his hands, and smote his thighs, and threw him­ <lb/>
            self upon the ground, and kept continually crying out, “ I am <lb/>
            Flaccus ! who but a little while ago was the governor of the <lb/>
            mighty city, of the populous city of Alexandria! the governor <lb/>
            of that most fertile of all countries, Egypt! I am he on <lb/>
            whom all those myriads of inhabitants turned their eyes ! who <lb/>
            had countless forces of infantry, and cavalry, and ships, for­ <lb/>
            midable, not merely by their number, but consisting of all the <lb/>
            most eminent and illustrious of all my subjects ! I am he who <lb/>
            was every day accompanied when I went out by countless com­ <lb/>
            panies of clients! But now, was not all this a vision rather <lb/>
            than reality ? and was I asleep, and was this prosperity which <lb/>
            I then beheld a dream-phantoms marching through empty <lb/>
            space, fictions of the soul, which perhaps registered non- <lb/>
            existent things as though they had a being? Doubtless, I <lb/>
            have been deceived. These things were but a shadow and no <lb/>
            real things, imitations of reality and not a real truth, which <lb/>
            makes falsehood evident; for as after we have awakened we <lb/>
            find none of those things which appeared to us in our dreams, <lb/>
            but all such things have fled in a body and disappeared, so too, <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            all that brilliant prosperity which I formerly enjoyed has now <lb/>
            been extinguished in the briefest moment of time."</p>
          <p>XX. With such discourses as these, he was continually <lb/>
            being cast down, and in a manner, as I may say, prostrated; <lb/>
            and avoiding all places where he might be likely to meet with <lb/>
            many persons on account of the shame which clung to him, he <lb/>
            never went down to the harbour, nor could he endure to visit <lb/>
            the market-place, but shut himself up in his house, where he <lb/>
            kept himself close, never venturing to go beyond the outer <lb/>
            court. But sometimes indeed, in the deepest twilight of the <lb/>
            dawn, when every one else was still in bed, so that he could be <lb/>
            seen by no one whatever, he would go forth out of the city and <lb/>
            spend the entire day in the desolate part of the island, turning <lb/>
            away if any one seemed likely to meet him; and being torn as <lb/>
            to his soul with the memorials of his misfortunes which he saw <lb/>
            about him in his house, and being devoured with anguish, he <lb/>
            went back home in the darkness of the night, praying, by <lb/>
            reason of his immoderate and never-ending misery, that the <lb/>
            evening would become morning, dreading the darkness and the <lb/>
            strange appearances which represented themselves to him <lb/>
            when he went to sleep, and again in the morning he prayed <lb/>
            that it might be evening; * for the darkness which surrounded <lb/>
            him was opposed to everything light or cheerful.</p>
          <p>And a few months afterwards, having purchased a small <lb/>
            piece of land, he spent a great deal of his time there living by <lb/>
            himself, and bewailing and weeping over his fate. It is said <lb/>
            too, that often at midnight he became possessed like those who <lb/>
            celebrate the rites of the Corybantes, and at such times he <lb/>
            would go forth out of his farm-house and raise his eyes to <lb/>
            heaven and to the stars, and beholding all the beauty really <lb/>
            existing in the world, he would cry out, " 0 King of gods and <lb/>
            men ! you are not, then, indifferent to the Jewish nation, nor <lb/>
            are the assertions which they relate with respect to your provi­ <lb/>
            dence false; but those men who say that that people has not <lb/>
            you for their champion and defender, are far from a correct <note type="footnote"> * This is evidently taken from Deuteronomy xxviii. 66, "And thy <lb/>

            opinion. And I am an evident proof of this; for all the <lb/>
            frantic designs which I conceived against the Jews, I now <lb/>
            suffer myself. I consented when they were stripped of their <lb/>
            possessions, giving immunity to those who were plundering <lb/>
            them ; and on this account I have myself been deprived of all <lb/>
            my paternal and maternal inheritance, and of all that I <lb/>
            have ever acquired by gift or favour, and of everything else <lb/>
            that ever became mine in any other manner. In times past I <lb/>
            reproached them with ignominy as being foreigners, though <lb/>
            they were in truth sojourners in the land entitled to full privi­ <lb/>
            leges, in order to give pleasure to their enemies who were a <lb/>
            promiscuous and disorderly multitude, by whom I, miserable <lb/>
            man that I was, was flattered and deceived; and for this I <lb/>
            have been myself branded with infamy, and have been <lb/>
            driven as an exile from the whole of the habitable world, and <lb/>
            am shut up in this place. Again, I led some of them into the <lb/>
            theatre, and commanded them to be shamelessly and unjustly <lb/>
            insulted in the sight of their greatest enemies; and therefore <lb/>
            I justly have been myself led not into a theatre or into one <lb/>
            city, but into many cities, to endure the utmost extremity of <lb/>
            insult, being ill-treated in my miserable soul instead of my <lb/>
            body; for I was led in procession through the whole of Italy <lb/>
            as far as Brundusium, and through all Peloponnesus as far as <lb/>
            Corinth, and through Attica, and all the islands as far as <lb/>
            Andros, which is this prison of mine; and I am thoroughly as­ <lb/>
            sured that even this is not the limit of my misfortunes, but <lb/>
            that others are still in store for me, to fill up the measure <lb/>
            as a requital for all the evils which I have done. I put many <lb/>
            persons to death, and when some of them were put to death by <lb/>
            others, I did not chastise their murderers. Some were stoned; <lb/>
            some were burnt alive; others were dragged through the <lb/>
            middle of the market-place till the whole of their bodies were <lb/>
            torn to pieces. And for all this I know now that retribution <lb/>
            awaits me, and that the avengers are already standing as it <lb/>
            were at the goal,- and are pressing close to me, eager to slay <lb/>
            me, and every day, or I may rather say, every hour, I die <lb/>
            before my time, enduring many deaths instead of one, the last <lb/>
            of all" ✻ <note type="footnote"> * This is like the passage in Shakespeare— <lb/>

          <p>And he was continually giving way to dread and to appre­ <lb/>
            hension, and shaking with fear in every limb and every <lb/>
            portion of his body, and his whole soul was trembling with <lb/>
            terror and quivering with palpitation and agitation, as if <lb/>
            nothing in the world could possibly be a comfort to the man <lb/>
            now that he was deprived of all favourable hopes; no good <lb/>
            omen ever appeared to him, everything bore a hostile appear­ <lb/>
            ance, every report was ill-omened, his waking was painful, his <lb/>
            sleep fearful, his solitude resembling that of wild beasts, <lb/>
            nevertheless the solitude of his herds was what was most <lb/>
            pleasant to him, any dwelling in the city was his greatest <lb/>
            affliction; his safe reproach was a solitary abiding in the <lb/>
            fields, a dangerous, and painful, and unseemly way of life; <lb/>
            every one who approached him, however justly, was an object <lb/>
            of suspicion to him. " This man," he would say, " who is <lb/>
            coming quickly hither, is planning something against me, he <lb/>
            does not look as if he were hastening for any other object, but <lb/>
            he is pursuing me; this pleasant looking man is laying a snare <lb/>
            for me; this free-spoken man is despising me; this man is <lb/>
            giving me meat and drink as they feed cattle before killing <lb/>
            them. How long shall I, hard-hearted that I am, bear up <lb/>
            against such terrible calamities? I well know that I am <lb/>
            afraid of death, since out of cruelty the Deity will not punish <lb/>
            me violently, to cut short my miserable life, in order to load <lb/>
            me to excess with irremediable miseries, which he treasures <lb/>
            up against me, to do a pleasure to those whom I treacherously <lb/>
            put to death."</p>
          <p>XXI. While repeating these things over and over again <lb/>
            and writhing with his agony, he awaited the end of his destiny, <lb/>
            and his uninterrupted sorrow agitated, and disturbed, and over­ <lb/>
            turned his soul. But Caius, being a man of an inhuman <lb/>
            nature and insatiable in his revenge, did not, as some persons <lb/>
            do, let go those who had been once punished, but raged against <lb/>
            them without end, and was continually contriving some new <lb/>
            and terrible suffering for them; and, above all men, he hated <lb/>
            Flaccus to such a degree, that he suspected all who bore the <lb/>
            same name, from his detestation of the very appellation ; and <lb/>
            he often repented that he had condemned him to banishment <lb/>
            and not to death, and though he had a great respect for <lb/>
            Lepidus who had interceded for him, he blamed him, so that <lb/>
            he was kept in a state of great alarm from fear of punishment <note type="footnote"> VOL. IT. </note> <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            impending over him, for he feared lest, as was very likely, he, <lb/>
            because he had been the cause of another person having been <lb/>
            visited by a lighter punishment, might himself have a more <lb/>
            severe one inflicted upon him.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as no one any longer ventured to say a word by <lb/>
            way of deprecating the anger of the emperor, he gave loose to <lb/>
            his fury, which was now implacable and unrestrained, and <lb/>
            which, though it ought to have been mitigated by time, was <lb/>
            rather increased by it, just as recurring diseases are in the <lb/>
            body when a relapse takes place, for all such relapses are more <lb/>
            grievous than the original attacks.</p>
          <p>They say that on one occasion Caius, being awake at night, <lb/>
            began to turn his mind to the magistrates and officers who <lb/>
            were in banishment, and who in name indeed were looked <lb/>
            upon as unfortunate, but who in reality had now thus <lb/>
            acquired a life free from trouble, and truly tranquil and free. <lb/>
            And he gave a new name to this banishment, calling it an <lb/>
            emigration, " For," said he, " it is only a kind of emigration <lb/>
            the banishment of these men, inasmuch as they have all the <lb/>
            necessaries of life in abundance, and are able to live in tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, and stability, and peace. But it is an absurdity for <lb/>
            them to be living in luxury, enjoying peace, and indulging in <lb/>
            all the pleasures of a philosophical life."</p>
          <p>Then he commanded the most eminent of these men, and <lb/>
            those who were of the highest rank and reputation, to be put <lb/>
            to death, giving a regular list of their names, at the head of <lb/>
            which list was Flaccus. And when the men arrived at <lb/>
            Andros, who had been commanded to put him to death, <lb/>
            Flaccus happened, just at that moment, to be coming from his <lb/>
            farm into the city, and they, on their way up from the port, <lb/>
            met him, and while yet at a distance they perceived and <lb/>
            recognised one another; at which he, perceiving in a moment <lb/>
            the object for which they were come (for every man's soul is <lb/>
            very prophetic, especially of such as are in misfortune), turn­ <lb/>
            ing out of the road, fled and ran away over the rough ground, <lb/>
            forgetting, perhaps, that Andros was an island and not the con­ <lb/>
            tinent. And what is the use of speed in an island which the <lb/>
            sea washes all round ? for one of two things must of necessity <lb/>
            happen, either that if the fugitive advances further he must be <lb/>
            carried into the sea, or else arrested when he has reached the <lb/>
            farthest boundary. Therefore, in a comparison of evils, destruc­ <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            t'on by land must be preferable to destruction by sea, since <lb/>
            nature has made the land more closely akin to man, and to all <lb/>
            terrestrial animals, not only while they are alive, but even <lb/>
            after they are dead, in order that the same element may <lb/>
            receive both their primary generation and their last dis­ <lb/>
            solution.</p>
          <p>The officers therefore pursued him without stopping to take <lb/>
            breath and arrested him ; and then immediately some of them <lb/>
            dug a ditch, and the others dragged him on by force in spite of <lb/>
            all his resistance and crying out and struggling, by which <lb/>
            means his whole body was wounded like that of beasts that <lb/>
            are despatched with a number of wounds; for he, turning <lb/>
            round them and clinging to his executioners, who were hin­ <lb/>
            dered in their aims which they took at him with their swords, <lb/>
            and who thus struck him with oblique blows, was the cause of <lb/>
            his own sufferings being more severe; for he was in conse­ <lb/>
            quence mutilated and cut about the hands, and feet, and head, <lb/>
            and breast, and sides, so that he was mangled like a victim, <lb/>
            and thus he fell, justice righteously inflicting on his own body <lb/>
            wounds equal in number to the murders of the Jews whom he <lb/>
            had unlawfully put to death.</p>
          <p>And the whole place flowed with blood which was shed from <lb/>
            his numerous veins, which were cut in every part of his body, <lb/>
            and which poured forth blood as from a fountain. And when <lb/>
            the corpse was dragged into the trench which had been dug, <lb/>
            the greater part of the limbs separated from the body, the <lb/>
            sinews by which the whole of the body is kept together being <lb/>
            all cut through.</p>
          <p>Such was the end of Flaccus, who suffered thus, being made <lb/>
            the most manifest evidence that the nation of the Jews is not <lb/>
            left destitute of the providential assistance of God.</p>

          <p>I. How long shall we, who are aged men, still be like <lb/>
            children, being indeed as to our bodies gray-headed through the <lb/>
            length of time that we have lived, but as to our souls utterly <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            infantine through our want of sense and sensibility, looking <lb/>
            upon that which is the most unstable of all things, namely, <lb/>
            fortune, as most invariable, and that which is of all things in <lb/>
            the world the most steadfast, namely, nature, as utterly un­ <lb/>
            trustworthy ? For, like people playing at draughts, we make <lb/>
            changes, altering the position of actions, and considering the <lb/>
            things which are the result of fortune as more durable than <lb/>
            those which result from nature, and the things which proceed in <lb/>
            accordance with nature as less stable than those which are the <lb/>
            result of chance. And the reason of all this is, that we form <lb/>
            our judgment of present events without paying any prudential <lb/>
            attention to the future, being influenced by the erroneous <lb/>
            guidance of our outward senses instead of the secret operations <lb/>
            of the intellect; for the things which are openly conspicuous <lb/>
            and before our hands so as to be taken up by them, are com­ <lb/>
            prehended by our eyes, but our reasoning power outstrips them, <lb/>
            hastening onwards to what is invisible and future ; but never­ <lb/>
            theless, we obscure the vision of our reason, though it is <lb/>
            far more acute than those bodily powers of sight which are <lb/>
            exercised by the eyes, some of us confusing it by indulgence <lb/>
            in wine and satiety, and others by that greatest of all evils, <lb/>
            namely, ignorance.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the existing opportunity and the many and <lb/>
            important propositions which arise to be decided on at the <lb/>
            present time, even if some people should be incredulous that <lb/>
            the Deity exercises a providential foresight with regard to <lb/>
            human affairs, and especially on behalf of a nation which ad­ <lb/>
            dresses its supplications to him, which belongs especially to the <lb/>
            father and sovereign of the universe, and the great cause of all <lb/>
            things ; and these propositions are sufficient to persuade them <lb/>
            of this truth.*</p>
          <p>And this nation of suppliants is in the Chaldaic language <lb/>
            called Israel, but when the name is translated into the Greek <lb/>
            language it is called, “ the seeing nation which appellation <lb/>
            appears to me to be the most honourable of all things in the <lb/>
            world, whether private or public ; for if the sight of elders, or <lb/>
            instructors, or rulers, or parents, excites those who behold <lb/>
            them to reverence and orderly conduct, and to an admiration <lb/>
            of and desire for a life of moderation and temperance, how <lb/>
            great a bulwark of virtue and excellence must we not expect <note type="footnote"> * There seems some corruptiou in the text here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            to find in those souls which, after having investigated the <lb/>
            nature of every created thing, have learnt to contemplate the <lb/>
            uncreated and Divine Being, the first good of all, the one <lb/>
            beautiful, and happy, and glorious, and blessed being ; better, <lb/>
            if one is to tell the plain truth, than the good itself; more <lb/>
            beautiful than the beautiful itself; more happy than happiness <lb/>
            itself; more blessed than blessedness itself; and, in short, if <lb/>
            anything else in the world is so, more perfect than any one of <lb/>
            the above-mentioned things.</p>
          <p>For reason cannot make such advances as to attain to a <lb/>
            thorough comprehension of God, who can neither be touched <lb/>
            nor handled ; but it withdraws from and falls short of such a <lb/>
            height, being unable to employ appropriate language as a step <lb/>
            towards the manifestation (I will not say of the living God, <lb/>
            for even if the whole heaven were to become endowed with <lb/>
            articulate voice, it would not be furnished with felicitous and <lb/>
            appropriate expressions to do justice to such a subject); but <lb/>
            even of his subordinate powers, those, for instance, by which he <lb/>
            created the world and by which he reigns over it as its king, and <lb/>
            by which he foresees the future, and all his other beneficent, <lb/>
            and chastising, and corrective powers. Unless, indeed, we <lb/>
            ought to class his correction among his beneficent powers, not <lb/>
            only because such a display is a portion of his laws and ordi­ <lb/>
            nances (for law is made up of two things, the honour of the <lb/>
            good, and the chastisement of the wicked), but also because <lb/>
            punishment reproves, and very often even corrects, and ame­ <lb/>
            liorates those who have done wrong; and if it fails to do so <lb/>
            with respect to them, at all events it does so to those who are <lb/>
            near the offenders thus punished ; for the punishment of <lb/>
            others makes most men better, for fear lest they themselves <lb/>
            should suffer the same things.</p>
          <p>II. For who-when he saw Caius, after the death of Tiberius <lb/>
            Cæsar, assuming the sovereignty of the whole world in a <lb/>
            condition free from all sedition, and regulated by and obedient <lb/>
            to admirable laws, and adapted to unanimity and harmony in <lb/>
            all its parts, east and west, south and north; the barbarian na-­ <lb/>
            tions being in harmony with the Greeks, and the Greeks with the <lb/>
            barbarians, and the soldiers with the body of private citizens, <lb/>
            and the citizens with the military ; so that they all partook of <lb/>
            and enjoyed one common universal peace-could fail to marvel <lb/>
            at and be amazed at his extraordinary and unspeakable good <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            fortune, since he had thus succeeded to a ready-made inherit-­ <lb/>
            ance of all good things, collected together as it were in one <lb/>
            heap, namely. to numerous and vast treasures of money, and <lb/>
            silver and gold, some in bullion, and some in coined money, <lb/>
            and some again being devoted to articles of luxury, in <lb/>
            drinking cups and other vessels, which are made for display <lb/>
            and magnificence ; and also countless hosts of troops, infantry, <lb/>
            and cavalry, and naval forces, and revenues which were sup­ <lb/>
            plied in a never-ending stream as from a fountain; and the <lb/>
            sovereignty of the most numerous, and most valuable, and im­ <lb/>
            portant portions of the habitable world, which in fact one may <lb/>
            fairly call the whole world, being not only all that is bounded <lb/>
            by the two rivers, the Euphrates and the Rhine ; the one of <lb/>
            which confines Germany and all the more uncivilised nations : <lb/>
            and the Euphrates, on the other hand, bridles Parthia and the <lb/>
            nations of the Sarmatians and Scythians, which are not less <lb/>
            barbarous and unciclised than the Germanic tribes: but. even <lb/>
            as I said before, all the world, from the rising to the setting <lb/>
            sun, all the land in short on this side of the Ocean and beyond <lb/>
            the Ocean, at which all the Roman people and all Italy <lb/>
            rejoiced, and even all the Asiatic and European nations.</p>
          <p>For as tney had never yet all together admired any emperor <lb/>
            who had ever existed at that time, not expecting to have in <lb/>
            future the possession, and use, and enjoyment of all private <lb/>
            and public good things, but thinking that they actually had <lb/>
            them already as a sort of superfluity of prosperity which hap­ <lb/>
            piness was waiting to fill to the brim : accordingly now there <lb/>
            was nothing else to be seen in any city, but altars, and victims. <lb/>
            and sacrifices, and men clothed in white garments, and crowned <lb/>
            with garlands, and wearing cheerful countenances, and display­ <lb/>
            ing their joy by the brightness of their looks, and festivals, and <lb/>
            assemblies, and musical contests, and horse-races, and revels, <lb/>
            and feasts lasting the whole night long, with the music of the <lb/>
            flute and of the lyre, and rejoicings, and holidays, and truces, <lb/>
            and every kind of pleasure addressed to every one of the <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>On this occasion the rich were not better off than the poor, <lb/>
            nor the men of high rank than the lowly, nor the creditors <lb/>
            than the debtors, nor the masters than the slaves, since the <lb/>
            occasion gave equal privileges and communities to all men, so <lb/>
            that the age of Saturn, which is so celebrated by the poets <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            was no longer looked upon as a fiction and a fable,. on <lb/>
            account of the universal prosperity and happiness which <lb/>
            reigned every where, and the absence of all grief and fear, and <lb/>
            the daily and nightly exhibitions of joy and festivity through­ <lb/>
            out every house and throughout the whole people, which lasted <lb/>
            continually without any interruption during the first seven <lb/>
            months of his reign.</p>
          <p>But in the eighth month a severe disease attached Caius <lb/>
            who had changed the manner of his living which was a little <lb/>
            while before, while Tiberius was alive, very simple and on <lb/>
            that account more wholesome than one of great sumptuousness <lb/>
            and luxury; for he began to indulge in abundance of strong <lb/>
            wine and eating of rich dishes, and in the abundant license of <lb/>
            insatiable desires and great insolence, and in the unseasonable <lb/>
            use of hot baths, and emetics, and then again in wine-bibbing <lb/>
            and drunkenness, and returning gluttony, and in lust after boys <lb/>
            and women, and in everything else which tends to destroy <lb/>
            both soul and body, and all the bonds which unite and <lb/>
            strengthen the two; for the rewards of temperance are health <lb/>
            and strength, and the wages of intemperance are weakness <lb/>
            and disease which bring a man near to death.</p>
          <p>III. Accordingly, when the news was spread abroad that he <lb/>
            was sick while the weather was still suitable for navigation <lb/>
            (for it was the beginning of the autumn, which is the last season <lb/>
            during which nautical men can safely take voyages, and during <lb/>
            which in conseqience they all return from the foreign marts <lb/>
            in every quarter to their own native ports and harbours of <lb/>
            refuge, especially all who exercise a prudent care not to be <lb/>
            compelled to pass the winter in a foreign country) ; they, for­ <lb/>
            saking their former life of delicateness and luxury, now wore <lb/>
            mournful faces, and every house and every city became full of <lb/>
            depression and melancholy, their grief being now equal to and <lb/>
            counterbalancing the joy which they experienced a short time <lb/>
            before. For every portion of the habitable world was diseased <lb/>
            in his sickness, fueling affected with a more terrible disease <note type="footnote"> * The golden age was said to have existed during the reign of Saturn <lb/>
            upon earth. So Tibullus says— <lb/>
            <l>Quam bIDe vivebant Saturno rege, priusquam </l><lb/>
            <l><Tellus in Ion.-as est patefacta vias./l> <lb/>
            And Virgil— <lb/>
            <l>Aureus lane vitam in terris Saturnus agebat.</l> </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            than that which was oppressing Caius; for his sickness <lb/>
            was that of the body alone, but the universal malady which <lb/>
            was oppressing all men every where was one which attacked <lb/>
            the vigour of their souls, their peace, their hopes, their parti­ <lb/>
            cipation in and enjoyment of all good things ; for men began <lb/>
            to remember how numerous and how great are the evils which <lb/>
            spring from anarchy, famine, and war, and the destruction of <lb/>
            trees, and devastations, and deprivation of lands, and plunder­ <lb/>
            ing of money, and the intolerable fear of slavery and death, <lb/>
            which no one can relieve, all which evils appeared to admit of <lb/>
            but one remedy, namely the recovery of Caius.</p>
          <p>Accordingly when his disease began to abate, in a very <lb/>
            short time even the men who were living on the very confines <lb/>
            of the empire heard of it and rejoiced, for nothing is swifter <lb/>
            than report,* and immediately every city was full of suspense <lb/>
            and expectation, being continually eager for better news, until <lb/>
            at length his perfect recovery was announced by fresh arrivals, <lb/>
            at which news they again returned to their original cheerful­ <lb/>
            ness, each thinking the health of Caius to be his own salvation ; <lb/>
            and this feeling pervaded every continent and every island, <lb/>
            for no one can recollect so great and general a joy affecting <lb/>
            any one country or any one nation, at the good health or pros­ <lb/>
            perity of their governor, as now pervaded the whole of the <lb/>
            habitable world at the recovery of Caius, and at his being able <lb/>
            to resume the exercise of his power and having completely got <lb/>
            rid of his sickness.</p>
          <p>For they all rejoiced, from ignorance of the truth, like men <lb/>
            who are now for the first time beginning to exchange a wand­ <lb/>
            ering and uncivilised mode of life for a social and civilised <lb/>
            system, and instead of dwelling in desert pluces, and the open <lb/>
            air, and the mountain districts, to live in walled cities, and <lb/>
            instead of living without any governor, or protector, or lawgiver, <lb/>
            to be now established under the care of a governor to be a sort <lb/>
            of shepherd and leader of a more domesticated flock; for the <lb/>
            human mind is apt to be blind towards the perception of what <lb/>
            is really expedient and beneficial for it, being influenced <lb/>
            rather by conjecture and notions of probability than by real <lb/>
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>IV. At all events it was not long before Caius—who was <note type="footnote"> * So Virgil says— <lb/>
            Fama malum quo non aliucl velocius ullum— Æn. iv. 174. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            now looked upon as a saviour and benefactor, and who was <lb/>
            expected to shower down some fresh and everlasting springs of <lb/>
            benefits upon all Asia and Europe, so as to endow the inhabit­ <lb/>
            ants with inalienable happiness and prosperity, both separately <lb/>
            to each individual and generally to the whole state-began, as <lb/>
            the proverb has it, at home, and changed into a ferocity of <lb/>
            disposition, or, I should rather say, displayed the savageness <lb/>
            which he had previously overshadowed by pretence and <lb/>
            hypocrisy; for he put to death his cousin who had been left as <lb/>
            the partner of his kingdom, and who was in fact a more natural <lb/>
            successor to it than he himself; for he himself was only Tiber <lb/>
            rius's grandson by adoption, but the other was so by blood J <lb/>
            arguing as a pretext that he had detected him in plotting <lb/>
            against him, though his very age was a sufficient refutation of <lb/>
            any such accusation; for the unhappy victim was only just <lb/>
            emerging from boyhood, and beginning to rank among the <lb/>
            youths. And, as some persons say, if Tiberius had lived a <lb/>
            short time longer, Caius would have been made away with, as <lb/>
            he began to be looked upon by him with unalterable suspicion, <lb/>
            and the genuine grandson of Tiberius would have been named <lb/>
            the future emperor, and the inheritor of his paternal kingdom.</p>
          <p>But Tiberius was carried off by fate, before he could bring <lb/>
            his designs to their completion; and Caius thought that he <lb/>
            should be able to escape all evil report which might arise from <lb/>
            his transgressing the principles of justice with respect to his <lb/>
            partner by outwitting him. And the contrivance which he <lb/>
            adopted was of the following character. Having assembled <lb/>
            all the chief magistrates, he said : "I am desirous that he who <lb/>
            is my cousin by birth and my brother in affection, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the instruction of Tiberius who is now dead, shall be <lb/>
            a partner with me in my absolute authority. But you your­ <lb/>
            selves perceive that he is as yet a mere child, and that he is in <lb/>
            need of masters, and teachers, and guardians; since what can <lb/>
            be a more desirable blessing for me than that my one mind <lb/>
            and one body shall not be loaded with so great a weight of the <lb/>
            cares of government, but for me to have some one who may <lb/>
            be able to lighten and alleviate them by sharing them *? J, <lb/>
            therefore," said he: "passing over and being superior to all <lb/>
            tutors, and masters, and guardians, register myself as his <lb/>
            father, and him as my son."</p>
          <p>V. With these words he deceived both those who were <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            present and the youth himself; for his proposal was a mere <lb/>
            bait, his intention being not to invest him with the power <lb/>
            which he expected, but to deprive him of even that which he <lb/>
            already had, according to the law affecting co-heirs and <lb/>
            partners; and accordingly now he plotted against him with <lb/>
            absolute fearlessness, having no regard for nor fear of any one; <lb/>
            for by the laws of the Romans the most complete and absolute <lb/>
            authority over the son belongs to the father, besides the fact of <lb/>
            Caius having the imperial authority which was wholly irrespon­ <lb/>
            sible, since no one could either venture or had any power to <lb/>
            demand an account from him of any thing whatever that he <lb/>
            might do.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, looking upon this youth to be like a thirds-man <lb/>
            in the games, he proceeded to overthrow him, feeling no com­ <lb/>
            passion, either for the fact of his having been brought up with <lb/>
            him, or his being so nearly related to him, or for his age, but <lb/>
            having no idea of sparing this miserable youth, doomed to an <lb/>
            early death; his own partner in the government, his co-heir, <lb/>
            who had formerly been expected to be all but the absolute <lb/>
            emperor, by reason of his being the nearest relation to <lb/>
            Tiberius; for when their fathers are dead, the grandsons are <lb/>
            usually looked upon by their grandfathers as standing in the <lb/>
            position of sons.</p>
          <p>It is said moreover, that this youth, being ordered to slay <lb/>
            himself with his own hands, while a centurion and a captain of <lb/>
            a thousand were standing by (who had been expressly com­ <lb/>
            manded to take no part in the horrid deed, since it was not <lb/>
            lawful for the descendants of the emperors to be put to death <lb/>
            by any one else; for Caius remembered the laws amid his <lb/>
            lawless acts, and had some regard for piety in all his impious <lb/>
            deeds, imitating as well as he could the nature of truth) ; he, <lb/>
            not knowing how to kill himself, for he had never seen any <lb/>
            one else put to death, and had never had any practice in <lb/>
            fighting with weapons, which is the usual exercise and course <lb/>
            of instruction for children who are being educated with a view <lb/>
            to become leaders and rulers, on account of the wars which <lb/>
            they may have to conduct, at first exhorted those officers who <lb/>
            had come to him to put him to death themselves, stretching <lb/>
            out his neck; but when they did not dare to do so, he himself <lb/>
            taking the sword inquired in his ignorance and want of <lb/>
            experience what was the most mortal place, in order that by <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            a well-directed blow he might cut short his miserable life; and <lb/>
            they, like instructors in misery, led him on his way, and <lb/>
            pointed out to him the part into which he was to thrust his <lb/>
            sword; and he, having thus learnt his first and last lesson, <lb/>
            became himself, miserable that he was, his own murderer <lb/>
            under compulsion.</p>
          <p>VI. But when this first and greatest undertaking had been <lb/>
            accomplished by Caius, there being no longer left any one who <lb/>
            had any connexion with the supreme authority, to whom any <lb/>
            one who bore him ill-will, and who was suspected by him, <lb/>
            could possibly turn his eyes; he now, in the second place, <lb/>
            proceeded to compass the death of Macro, a man who had co- <lb/>
            operated with him in every thing relating to the empire, not <lb/>
            only after he had been appointed emperor, for it is a character­ <lb/>
            istic of flattery to court those who are in a state of prosperity, <lb/>
            but who had previously assisted him in his measures for <lb/>
            securing that authority.</p>
          <p>For Tiberius, who was a man of very profound prudence, <lb/>
            and the most able of all the men of his court at perceiving the <lb/>
            hidden intentions of any man, and who was as pre-eminent in <lb/>
            intelligence and acuteness as he was in good fortune, did very <lb/>
            often look with suspicion upon Caius as being evil disposed <lb/>
            towards all the house of Claudius, and as being related to him <lb/>
            only on the mother's side,* and he feared for his grandson, lest <lb/>
            he, being left a mere child, should be put to death by him. <lb/>
            And he judged him, moreover, very little fitted for an <lb/>
            authority of such magnitude, both on account of the unsociable­ <lb/>
            ness and ferocity of his nature, and the inequality of his <lb/>
            temper; for he was continually giving way to the most frantic <lb/>
            and most inconsistent moods, not preserving any consistency <lb/>
            either in his words or in his actions; all which Macro studied <lb/>
            with all his strength at every opportunity, pacifying the suspi­ <lb/>
            cions of Tiberius and all the prejudices with which he <lb/>
            perceived that his mind was inflamed against Caius by reason <lb/>
            of his ceaseless fear and anxiety for his grandson.</p>
          <p>For he represented to him, that Caius was a person of a <lb/>
            good and obedient disposition, and one who entertained the <lb/>
            greatest affection for his cousin, so that out of his exceeding <lb/>
            regard for him he would be willing even to abandon the <lb/>
            government and to yield it up to him by himself, but that <note type="footnote"> * Caligula was the son of Germanicus and Agrippina. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            excessive modesty was anything but advantageous to many <lb/>
            persons, in consequence of which Caius, who was of a most <lb/>
            guileless and single-minded disposition, was looked upon by <lb/>
            many as crafty and designing.</p>
          <p>And when he could not persuade him, by all the arguments <lb/>
            drawn from probabilities which he advanced, he brought for­ <lb/>
            ward that which rested upon specific agreements, adding, " I <lb/>
            myself will be his security, I who deserve to have confidence <lb/>
            placed in me, inasmuch as I have given sufficient proof that <lb/>
            I myself am individually a friend to Cæsar, and a friend to <lb/>
            Tiberius, since it was I who carried into execution, your in­ <lb/>
            tentions respecting the downfall of Sejanus.</p>
          <p>And, in short, he was very assiduous, and energetic, and <lb/>
            comprehensive in his praises of Caius, if, indeed, one may <lb/>
            speak of speeches in defence of a man as equivalent to pane­ <lb/>
            gyrics on him, which were rather addressed to the doing away <lb/>
            with the unfavourable impressions and suspicions, excited by <lb/>
            obscure and indistinct hints and accusations. In short, all <lb/>
            the things which any one could say on behalf of any brother <lb/>
            or legitimate child, such and more too did Macro say to <lb/>
            Tiberius in behalf of Caius. And the cause of this was accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the report which obtain d among the generality of <lb/>
            people, not only that Macro had, on the other hand, been <lb/>
            greatly courted by him, as one who had the greatest, or, <lb/>
            indeed, all the power under the empire; but also that Macro's <lb/>
            wife was favourable to him, for a reason which ought not to be <lb/>
            mentioned, and she every day urged on, and encouraged, and <lb/>
            entreated her husband to omit no exertion of his zeal and <lb/>
            energy on behalf of the young man. And a wife is a very <lb/>
            powerful engine to divert or to persuade the mind of her hus­ <lb/>
            band, especially if she be one of an amorous temperament, for <lb/>
            because of her own consciousness she becomes more given to <lb/>
            flattery.</p>
          <p>And Macro, being ignorant of the dishonour done to his <lb/>
            marriage-bed and to his family, and looking upon her flattery <lb/>
            as a proof of her sincere good will and affection for him, was <lb/>
            deceived, and without being, aware of it was led, by her <lb/>
            intrigues, to embrace his bitterest enemies as his best friends.</p>
          <p>VII. Therefore, as he knew that he had preserved him ten <lb/>
            thousand times, when he was in the most imminent danger of <lb/>
            being put to death, he used to offer him undisguised, sincere, <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            and honest admonitions and advice, with perfect freedom of <lb/>
            speech; for, like a good workman, he was desirous that what <lb/>
            he looked upon as his own work should remain uninjured and <lb/>
            indestructible, without being put an end to, either by himself <lb/>
            or by any one else; therefore, whenever he saw him sleeping <lb/>
            at any entertainment he would go round and awaken him, <lb/>
            having, at the same time, a regard for what was becoming and <lb/>
            also for his safety, for a man who is asleep is a good object for <lb/>
            treachery ; and whenever he beheld him looking with an <lb/>
            excited eye at any dancers, or even sometimes dancing with <lb/>
            them, or not smiling with dignity upon actors of farcical and <lb/>
            laughable spectacles, but rather grinning like a boy, or wholly <lb/>
            carried away by the tunes of some harp-player or chorus, so as <lb/>
            on some occasions even to join in their song, he would, if he <lb/>
            was sitting or going near him, give him a nudge, and en­ <lb/>
            deavour to check him.</p>
          <p>And very often, when he was reclining near him, he would <lb/>
            whisper in his ear, and admonish him gently and quietly, so <lb/>
            that no one else might hear what was said, saying, " You <lb/>
            ought not only not to be like any one else here, but like no <lb/>
            one else whatever, neither at any spectacle, or at anything that <lb/>
            is to be heard, or in anything else that ever affects the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses, but you ought rather to surpass all other men in <lb/>
            every action of your life, as much as you surpass them in your <lb/>
            good fortune, for it is unreasonable for the ruler of all the <lb/>
            earth and of all the sea to be subdued by a song or by an ex­ <lb/>
            hibition of dancing, or by any ridiculous jest or piece of acting, <lb/>
            or by anything else of that kind ; and not on every occasion, <lb/>
            and in every place, to remember his position as emperor, <lb/>
            like a shepherd and protector of the flock, availing himself <lb/>
            of everything that can tend to any kind of amelioration, from <lb/>
            every word, and from every action, of every description what­ <lb/>
            ever."</p>
          <p>Then again he would add, “ When you are present at any <lb/>
            theatrical contest, or at any gymnastic games, or at any of the <lb/>
            contests in the hippodrome, do not consider the pursuits them­ <lb/>
            selves so much as the behaving correctly in all such pursuits, <lb/>
            and entertain thoughts of this nature : if some men labour <lb/>
            in this manner to bring to perfection things that can in no <lb/>
            respect benefit human life, but which only afford pleasure and <lb/>
            amusement to the spectators, in such a way as to be praised <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            and admired, and to receive rewards, and honours, and crowns, <lb/>
            and to have their names proclaimed as conquerors; what <lb/>
            ought that man to do who is skilful in the most sublime and <lb/>
            most important of all arts ? Now the greatest and most excel­ <lb/>
            lent of all sciences is the science of government, by means of <lb/>
            which every country which is good and fertile, whether it be <lb/>
            champaign or mountainous, is cultivated, and every sea is na­ <lb/>
            vigated without danger by heavily-laden merchant-vessels, to <lb/>
            communicate to the different countries the useful productions <lb/>
            of each, out of a natural desire for participation and associa­ <lb/>
            tion, so that each land receives what it stands in need of, and <lb/>
            sends abroad in requital those good things of which it has a <lb/>
            superfluity; for envy has never obtained a dominion over the <lb/>
            whole of the habitable world, nor even over those great <lb/>
            divisions of it, the whole of Europe or the whole of Asia, but <lb/>
            it lurks in holes like a venomous reptile, creeping out in small <lb/>
            districts to attack an individual man, or a single family, or, if <lb/>
            it is very violent and powerful, perhaps one city; but it never <lb/>
            attacks a larger circle of a whole nation or a whole country, <lb/>
            especially ever since your august family has really begun to <lb/>
            rule over all men in every part of the world.</p>
          <p>" For your house has discovered and brought to light every­ <lb/>
            thing that is good, even in the midst of evils, and has banished <lb/>
            all evils to the extremities of the earth, and beyond its borders <lb/>
            to the very depths of Tartarus, and has brought back, from the <lb/>
            most distant borders of the earth and sea, those profitable and <lb/>
            beneficial things which were in a manner banished into the <lb/>
            habitable world around us; and now all these things are en­ <lb/>
            trusted to your power, to be governed by your authority.</p>
          <p>" Accordingly you, having been conducted by nature to the <lb/>
            supreme helm of the world, and having the government of <lb/>
            everything placed in your hand, must guide the universal ship <lb/>
            of all mankind in a safe and salutary manner, rejoicing and <lb/>
            delighting in nothing more than in doing good to your sub­ <lb/>
            jects ; for different people have different contributions to <lb/>
            bestow, which individuals necessarily offer in their several <lb/>
            cities. But the most suitable gift for a ruler to give is to adopt <lb/>
            wise counsels with respect to those who are subject to his <lb/>
            authority, and to execute intentions which have been rightly <lb/>
            formed, and to bestow on them good things without any limita­ <lb/>
            tion, with a liberal hand and mind, except such as it may be <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            better to keep in reserve from a prudent foreknowledge of the <lb/>
            uncertainty of the future."</p>
          <p>VIII. The unhappy man kept dinning suggestions of this <lb/>
            kind into his ears in the hope of improving Caius; but he, <lb/>
            being a contentious and quarrelsome person, turned his mind in <lb/>
            the directly opposite direction, as if he were exhorted to do <lb/>
            exactly the contrary, and be conceived a most determined dis­ <lb/>
            gust for his monitor, so as never to behold him with a cheerful <lb/>
            countenance; and sometimes when he saw him at a distance <lb/>
            he would speak as follows to those near him: " Here comes <lb/>
            the teacher of one who has no longer any right to be looked <lb/>
            upon as a pupil ;-here comes the pedagogue of one who is no <lb/>
            longer a child, the monitor of one who is wiser than himself, <lb/>
            the man who thinks it proper that the emperor should obey <lb/>
            his subject, who sets himself up as a man deeply versed by <lb/>
            experience in the science of government, and as a teacher of <lb/>
            it, though from whom he has learnt the principles of sovereign <lb/>
            government I know not; for from the moment that I left my <lb/>
            cradle, I have had ten thousand instructors, fathers, brothers, <lb/>
            uncles, cousins, and grandfathers, up to the very founders of <lb/>
            my family, in fact every one related to me either on my <lb/>
            father's or my mother's side, who had acquired absolute power <lb/>
            for themselves, even without taking into consideration the fact <lb/>
            that, by their being the authors of my being, they had im­ <lb/>
            planted in me some degree of royal power and some natural <lb/>
            aptitude for government. For as similitudes of both body and <lb/>
            soul exist both in the form, and position, and motions of <lb/>
            men, and also as the inclinations, and dispositions, and actions <lb/>
            of men are preserved in some degree of similitude through the <lb/>
            principles of descent, so also is it probable that the very same <lb/>
            principles should convey an outline of similitude in respect of <lb/>
            one's aptitude for government. Shall any one, then, who is <lb/>
            ignorant dare to instruct me who am the reverse of ignorant ? <lb/>
            me who, even before my birth, while I was yet in my mother's <lb/>
            womb, was fashioned as an emperor in the workshop of nature ? <lb/>
            For how can it be possible for persons, who but a short time <lb/>
            before were private individuals, to contemplate as they should <lb/>
            the intentions of an imperial soul ? But some persons in their <lb/>
            shameless audacity dare to put themselves forward as inter­ <lb/>
            preters and perfecters of the principles of government, when <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            in reality they scarcely ought to be enrolled among those who <lb/>
            have any understanding whatever of the matter."</p>
          <p>And as he thus diligently laboured to alienate himself from <lb/>
            Macro, he began also to invent false but plausible and <lb/>
            specious grounds for blaming and accusing him; for passionate <lb/>
            and irritable natures, especially when belonging to powerful <lb/>
            men, are very ingenious at weaving plausibilities. Now, the <lb/>
            pretexts which he made use of against him were of the follow­ <lb/>
            ing natures. He said Macro thought thus: “ Caius is my <lb/>
            work ; the work of Macro. I am more truly, or at all events <lb/>
            not less truly, his father than his own parents. lie would <lb/>
            have been destroyed, over and over again, by Tiberius, who <lb/>
            thirsted for his blood, if it had not been for me and for Day <lb/>
            powers of persuasion. And moreover, when Tiberius was <lb/>
            dead, I, who had under my command the whole force of the <lb/>
            army, immediately placed him in the position which Tiberius <lb/>
            had occupied, teaching him that the state had indeed sustained <lb/>
            a loss of one man, but that the imperial authority continued <lb/>
            unaltered, as entire as ever."</p>
          <p>And many people have given credit to these assertions of <lb/>
            of his as if they were true, not being acquainted with the false <lb/>
            I and crafty disposition of the speaker ; for hitherto the dis­ <lb/>
            honest and designing character of his disposition was not made <lb/>
            manifest. But a few days afterwards the miserable man was <lb/>
            put to death, with his wife, receiving the extremity of punish­ <lb/>
            ment as a reward for his exceeding good will towards his <lb/>
            slayer. This is the consequence of doing kindnesses to un­ <lb/>
            grateful people; for in return for the benefits which they have <lb/>
            received, they inflict the greatest of injuries on those from <lb/>
            whom they have received them. Accordingly, Macro, who <lb/>
            had done everything in sincerity with the most earnest eager­ <lb/>
            ness and zeal for the good of Caius, in the first place in order <lb/>
            to save him from death, and afterwards in order that he by <lb/>
            himself might succeed to the imperial authority, received for <lb/>
            his reward the fate which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>For it is said that the wretched man was compelled to kill <lb/>
            himself with his own hand ; and his wife, too, experienced the <lb/>
            same misery, even though she indeed had at one time been <lb/>
            believed to be on the most intimate terms of familiarity with <lb/>
            Caius; but they say that none of the allurements of love are <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            stable and trustworthy because it is a passion which quickly <lb/>
            breeds satiety.</p>
          <p>IX. But after Macro and all his house had been sacrificed, <lb/>
            Cams then began to design a third more grievous piece of <lb/>
            treachery still.. His father-in-law had been Marcus Silanus, a <lb/>
            man full of wisdom, and very illustrious by birth. He, after <lb/>
            his daughter had died by an early death, still was very atten­ <lb/>
            tive and affectionate to Caius, showing all imaginable regard <lb/>
            for him, not so much like a father-in-law as like an actual <lb/>
            father, and he hoped that he should find that Caius also enter­ <lb/>
            tained equal good will towards him, transforming himself <lb/>
            according to the principles of equality from a son-in-law into a <lb/>
            son; but he was, without knowing it, cherishing mistaken <lb/>
            opinions, and deluding himself, for he was continually uttering <lb/>
            affectionate speeches, keeping back nothing which could tend <lb/>
            to the amelioration and improvement of Caius's disposition <lb/>
            and way of life and mode of government, speaking with all <lb/>
            freedom, and looking upon his own surpassing nobility of birth <lb/>
            and nearness of connexion by marriage as circumstances which <lb/>
            gave him grounds for great familiarity and openness, for his <lb/>
            daughter had been dead only a very short time, so that the <lb/>
            laws and bonds which bind such kinsmen were scarcely <lb/>
            destroyed, and one may almost say were still quivering with <lb/>
            life, some relics of the breath of vitality being still left, as it <lb/>
            were, and remaining warm in the body. But Caius, looking <lb/>
            upon every admonition as an insult, because he fancied that he <lb/>
            himself was the wisest and most virtuous of all men, and more­ <lb/>
            over the most valorous and the most just, hated all who <lb/>
            ventured to offer him instruction more than even his avowed <lb/>
            enemies.</p>
          <p>Therefore, looking on Silanus as a bore, who only wished to <lb/>
            check the impetuosity and indulgence of his appetites, and dis­ <lb/>
            carding all recollection of and regard for his deceased wife, he <lb/>
            treacherously put her father to death, who was also his own <lb/>
            father-in-law.</p>
          <p>X. And by this time the matter began to be widely talked <lb/>
            about in consequence of the continual deaths of so many <lb/>
            eminent men, so that now these things began to be spoken of <lb/>
            in every mouth as intolerable infamy and wickedness; not <lb/>
            indeed openly, from fear, but gently and under the breath, in <lb/>
            whispers; and then again, by a sudden change (for the multi- <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="114"/>
            tude is very unstable in everything, in intentions, and words, <lb/>
            and actions), men, disbelieving that one who but a little while <lb/>
            before was merciful and humane could have become altered so <lb/>
            entirely, for Caius had been looked upon as affable, and <lb/>
            sociable, and friendly, began to seek for excuses for him, <lb/>
            and after some search they found such, saying with regard to <lb/>
            his cousin and co-heir in the kingdom things such as these: <lb/>
            " The unchangeable law of nature has ordained that there <lb/>
            should be no partnership in sovereign power, and it has <lb/>
            established by its own unalterable principles what this man <lb/>
            must inevitably have suffered at the hands of his more powerful <lb/>
            co-heir. The one who was the more powerful has chastised the <lb/>
            other. This is not murder. Perhaps, indeed, the putting that <lb/>
            youth to death was done providentially for the advantage of <lb/>
            the whole human race, since if one portion had been assigned <lb/>
            as subjects to the one, and another portion to the other, there <lb/>
            would have arisen troubles and confusion, and civil and foreign <lb/>
            war. And what is better than peace ? and peace is caused by <lb/>
            good government on sound principles. And no government <lb/>
            can be good but that which is free from all contentions and <lb/>
            from all disputes, and then everything else is made right by <lb/>
            it.,,</p>
          <p>And in reference to the case of Macro, they said, " The man <lb/>
            was puffed up with pride in an immoderate degree; he had no <lb/>
            idea of that great lesson which came from Delphi, ' know thy­ <lb/>
            self. And they say that knowledge is the cause of happiness, <lb/>
            and that ignorance is the parent of unhappiness. What could <lb/>
            have possessed him to make such an alteration and change in <lb/>
            their relative positions as to thrust himself, who was a subject, <lb/>
            into the rank of a governor, and to depress Caius, who was the <lb/>
            emperor, into the place of a subject? For it is the part of a <lb/>
            ruler to command, and that was what Macro did; but it is the <lb/>
            duty of a subject to obey, and that was what he considered that <lb/>
            Caius was to submit to."</p>
          <p>For these inconsiderate men, without giving themselves the <lb/>
            trouble of inquiring into the truth, called the recommenda­ <lb/>
            tions of Macro commands, and called him who gave advice a <lb/>
            governor, out of ignorance and insensibility, or else out of <lb/>
            flattery, suppressing the truth and giving a false colouring to <lb/>
            the nature of both names and things.</p>
          <p>And in reference to Silanus they said, " Silanus was a most <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            ridiculous person when he took it into his head that a father- <lb/>
            in-Jaw would have as much influence with his son-in-law as a <lb/>
            real father has with a son. And yet even real fathers who are <lb/>
            in a private station submit to their sons when they are in <lb/>
            great offices and in places of high authority, being quite con­ <lb/>
            tent with the second place; but this foolish man, even when <lb/>
            he was no longer his father-in-law, kept on claiming privileges <lb/>
            which did not belong to him, without perceiving that with the <lb/>
            death of his daughter the connexion which had originated in <lb/>
            the marriage of Caius with her had also died, for intermar­ <lb/>
            riages are the bonds which unite families between which there <lb/>
            is no kindred, changing alienation into near connexion ; but <lb/>
            when that bond is dissolved, then the union is dissolved like­ <lb/>
            wise, especially when it is dissolved by a circumstance which <lb/>
            cannot be altered or remedied, namely, by the death of the <lb/>
            woman who was given in marriage into another family."</p>
          <p>Such conversations as these were held in every company, <lb/>
            the speakers being wholly influenced by their wish that the <lb/>
            emperor should not appear to be cruel; for as they had hoped <lb/>
            that such humanity and gentleness was seated in the soul of <lb/>
            Caius as had not existed in either of the previous emperors, <lb/>
            they thought it would be a most strange thing if he now made <lb/>
            so great and so sudden a change to an entirely contrary dis­ <lb/>
            position.</p>
          <p>XI. Having now, then, entirely accomplished the three <lb/>
            undertakings above-mentioned, with reference to three most <lb/>
            important divisions, two of them belonging to the country, one <lb/>
            to the class of counsellors and the other to the knights, and <lb/>
            the third affecting his own relations, and considering that now <lb/>
            that he had thus put down the mightiest and most powerful of <lb/>
            his foes, he must have struck all the rest with the utmost <lb/>
            terror, alarming the counsellors by the death of Silanus (for he <lb/>
            was inferior to no one in the senate), and the knights by the <lb/>
            execution of Macro (for he, like the leader of a chorus, had <lb/>
            long been considered the very first man of the knights for <lb/>
            reputation and glory), and all his blood relations by the <lb/>
            slaughter of his cousin and joint inheritor of the kingdom, he no <lb/>
            longer chose to remain fettered by the ordinary limits of human <lb/>
            nature, but aspired to raise himself above them, and desired to <lb/>
            be looked upon as a god.</p>
          <p>And at the beginning of this insane desire they say that he <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="116"/>
            was influenced by such a train of reasoning as the following : <lb/>
            for as the curators of the herds of other animals, namely cow­ <lb/>
            herds, and goatherds, and shepherds, are neither oxen nor <lb/>
            goats, nor sheep, but men who have received a more excellent <lb/>
            portion, and a more admirable formation of mind and body; so <lb/>
            in the same manner, said he, is it fitting that I who am the <lb/>
            leader of the most excellent of all herds, namely, the race of <lb/>
            mankind, should be considered as a being of a superior nature. <lb/>
            and not merely human, but as one who has received a greater <lb/>
            and more holy portion. Accordingly, having impressed this <lb/>
            idea on his mind, like a vain and foolish man as he was, he <lb/>
            bore about in himself a fallacious fable and invention as if it <lb/>
            had been a most undeniable truth; and after he had once <lb/>
            carried his boldness and audacity to such a pitch as to compel <lb/>
            the multitude to admit of his most impious deification, he <lb/>
            attempted to do other things consistent with and conformable <lb/>
            to it, and in this way he advanced up to the highest point by <lb/>
            slow degrees as if he were ascending up steps.</p>
          <p>For he began at first to liken himself to those beings who are <lb/>
            called demigods, such as Bacchus, and Hercules, and the twins <lb/>
            of Lacedsemon; turning into utter ridicule Trophonius, and <lb/>
            Amphiaraus, and Amphilochius, and others of the same kind, <lb/>
            with all their oracles and secret ceremonies, in comparison of <lb/>
            his own power. In the next place, like an actor in a theatre, <lb/>
            he was continually wearing different dresses at different times, <lb/>
            taking at one time a lion's skin and a club, both gilded over; <lb/>
            being then dressed in the character of Hercules; at another <lb/>
            time he would wear a felt hat upon his head, when he was <lb/>
            disguised in imitation of the Spartan twins, Castor and Pollux : <lb/>
            sometimes he also adorned himself with ivy, and a thyrsus, and <lb/>
            skins of fawns, so as to appear in the guise of Bacchus.</p>
          <p>And he looked upon himself as being in this respect supe­ <lb/>
            rior to all of these beings, because each of them while he had <lb/>
            his own peculiar honours had no claim to those which belonged <lb/>
            to the others, but he in his envious ambition appropriated all <lb/>
            the honours of the whole body of demigods at once, or I <lb/>
            should rather say, appropriated the demigods themselves; <lb/>
            transforming himself not into the triple-bodied Geryon, so as to <lb/>
            attract all beholders by the multitude of his bodies ; but, what <lb/>
            was the most extraordinary thing of all, changing and trans­ <lb/>
            forming the essence of one body into every variety of form and <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            figure, like the Egyptian Proteus, whom Homer has repre­ <lb/>
            sented as being susceptible of every variety of transformation, <lb/>
            into all the elements, and into the animals, and plants, which <lb/>
            belong to the different elements.*</p>
          <p>And yet why, 0 Caius! did you think yourself in need of <lb/>
            spurious honours, such as the temples and statues of the beings <lb/>
            above-mentioned are often filled with ? You ought rather to <lb/>
            have imitated their virtues. Hercules purified both the earth <lb/>
            and the sea, performing labours of the greatest possible im­ <lb/>
            portance and of the highest benefit to all mankind, in order to <lb/>
            eradicate all that was mischievous and calculated to injure the <lb/>
            nature of each of the elements. Bacchus rendered the vine <lb/>
            susceptible of cultivation, and extracted a most delicious drink <lb/>
            from it, which is at the same time most beneficial to the souls <lb/>
            and bodies of men, leading the first to cheerfulness, working in <lb/>
            them a forgetfulness of evils and a hope of blessings, and <lb/>
            making the latter more healthy, and vigorous, and active, and <lb/>
            supple. And individually it renders each man better, and alters <lb/>
            populous families and households, leading them from a squalid <lb/>
            and laborious life of vexation to a course of relaxation and <lb/>
            cheerful happiness, and causing to every city on earth, both <lb/>
            Grecian and barbarian, incessant festivity, and mirth, and <note type="footnote"> * The passage in Homer is to be found at Odyssey iv. 363. It is <lb/>
            imitated more concisely by Virgil, who makes Cyrene tell Aristæus— <lb/>
            Verum ubi correptum manibus vinclisque tenebis <lb/>
            Turn variæ eludent species atque ora ferarum; <lb/>
            Fiet enim subito sus horridus atraque tigris <lb/>
            Squamosusque draco et fulva cervice Icæna <lb/>
            Aut acrem flammæ sonitum dabit, atque ita vinclis <lb/>
            Excidet, aut in aquas tenues dilapsus abibit.-Georg. iv. 410. <lb/>
            Which is thus translated by Pope­ <lb/>
            “Instant he wears, elusive of the rape, <lb/>
            The mimic force of every savage shape: <lb/>
            Or glides with liquid lapse a murm'ring stream, <lb/>
            Or wrapt in flame, he glows at every limb. <lb/>
            Yet still retentive, with redoubled might <lb/>
            Thro' each vain passive form constrains his flight. <lb/>
            But when, his native shape resumed, he stands <lb/>
            Patient of conquest, and your muse demands; <lb/>
            The cause that urg'd the bold attempt declare, <lb/>
            And soothe the vanquish'd with a victor's prayer. <lb/>
            The bands relaxed, implore the seer to say <lb/>
            What godhead interdicts the wat'ry way." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            entertainment, and revelry; for of all these things is good <lb/>
            wine the cause.</p>
          <p>Again, it is said that the twin sons of Jupiter, Castor and <lb/>
            Pollux, are partakers of immortality. For since the one was <lb/>
            mortal and the other immortal, the one who had had the more <lb/>
            excellent portion assigned to him did not choose to behave in a <lb/>
            selfish manner, but rather to display his good will and affection <lb/>
            towards his brother ; for having acquired the idea that eternity <lb/>
            was never-ending, and considering that he was to live for ever, <lb/>
            and that his brother was to be dead for ever, and that in con­ <lb/>
            junction with his own immortality he should likewise be en­ <lb/>
            during an undying sorrow on account of his brother, he <lb/>
            conceived and carried out a most marvellous system of counter­ <lb/>
            balancing, mingling mortality with himself and immortality <lb/>
            with his brother, and thus he modified inequality, which is the <lb/>
            beginning of all injustice, by equality, which is the fountain of <lb/>
            justice.</p>
          <p>XII. All these beings, 0 Caius ! were admired on account <lb/>
            of the benefits which they had conferred on mankind, and they <lb/>
            are admired for them even up to the present time, and they <lb/>
            were deservedly thought worthy of veneration and of the very <lb/>
            highest honours. But come now, and tell us yourself in what <lb/>
            achievement of yours do you pride yourself and boast yourself <lb/>
            as being in the least similar to their actions ? Have you imi­ <lb/>
            tated the twin sons of Jupiter in their brotherly affection, that <lb/>
            I may begin with that point ? Did you not rather, 0 hard- <lb/>
            hearted and most pitiless of men ! inhumanly slaughter your <lb/>
            brother, the joint inheritor of the kingdom with you, even <lb/>
            before he had arrived at the full vigour of manhood, when he <lb/>
            was still in early youth. Did you not afterwards banish your <lb/>
            sisters, lest they also should cause you any reasonable appre­ <lb/>
            hension of the deprivation and loss of your imperial power ?</p>
          <p>Have you imitated Bacchus in any respect? Have you <lb/>
            been an inventor of any new blessings to mankind? Have <lb/>
            you filled the whole of the habitable world with joy as lie did ? <lb/>
            Are all Asia and Europe inadequate to contain the gifts which <lb/>
            have been showered upon mankind by you? No doubt you <lb/>
            have invented new arts and sciences, like a common pest and <lb/>
            murderer of your kind, by which you have changed all pleasant <lb/>
            'and acceptable things into vexation and sorrow, and have made <lb/>
            life miserable and intolerable to all men everywhere, appro­ <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            priating to yourself in your intolerable and insatiable greedi­ <lb/>
            ness all the good and beautiful things which belonged to every <lb/>
            one else, whether from the east or from any other country of <lb/>
            the universe, carrying off everything from the south, every­ <lb/>
            thing from the north, and in requital giving to and pouring <lb/>
            down upon those whom you had plundered every sort of mis­ <lb/>
            chievous and injurious things from your own bitter spirit, <lb/>
            everything which is ever engendered in cruel, and destructive, <lb/>
            and envenomed dispositions; these are the reasons why you <lb/>
            appeared to us as a new Bacchus.</p>
          <p>But I suppose you imitated Hercules in your unwearied <lb/>
            labours and your incessant displays of valour and virtue; you, <lb/>
            0 most wretched of men having filled every continent and <lb/>
            every island with good laws, and principles of justice, and <lb/>
            wealth, and comfort, and prosperity, and abundance of other <lb/>
            blessings, you, wretched man, full of all cowardice and iniquity, <lb/>
            who have emptied every city of all the things which can con­ <lb/>
            duce to stability and prosperity, and have made them full of <lb/>
            everything which leads to trouble and confusion, and the most <lb/>
            utter misery and desolation.</p>
          <p>Tell me then, 0 Caius! do you, after having made all these <lb/>
            contributions to universal destruction, do you, I say, seek to <lb/>
            acquire immortality in order to make the calamities which you <lb/>
            have heaped upon mankind, not of brief duration and short- <lb/>
            lived, but imperishable and everlasting ? But I think, on the <lb/>
            contrary, that even if you had previously appeared to be a god, <lb/>
            you would beyond all question have been changed on account <lb/>
            of your evil practices into an ordinary nature, resembling that, <lb/>
            of common perishable mortals ; for if virtues can make their <lb/>
            possessors immortal, then beyond all doubt vices can make <lb/>
            them mortal. Do not, therefore, inscribe your name by the <lb/>
            side of that of the twin sons of Jupiter, those most affectionate <lb/>
            of deities, you who have been the murderer and destruction of <lb/>
            your brethren, nor claim a share in the honours of Hercules <lb/>
            or Bacchus, who have benefited human life. You have been <lb/>
            the undoer and destroyer of those good effects which they <lb/>
            produced.</p>
          <p>XIII. But the madness and frenzy to which he gave way <lb/>
            were so preposterous, and so utterly insane, that he went even <lb/>
            beyond the demigods, and mounted up to and invaded the <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            veneration and worship paid to those who are looked upon as <lb/>
            greater than they, as the supreme deities of the world, Mercury, <lb/>
            and Apollo, and Mars.</p>
          <p>And first of all he dressed himself up with the caduceus, <lb/>
            and sandals, and mantle of Mercury, exhibiting a regularity in <lb/>
            his disorder, a consistency in his confusion, and a ratiocina­ <lb/>
            tion in his insanity.</p>
          <p>Afterwards, when he thought fit to do so, he laid aside these <lb/>
            ornaments, and metamorphosed and transformed himself into <lb/>
            Apollo, crowning his head with garlands, in the form of rays, <lb/>
            and holding a bow and arrows in his left hand, and holding <lb/>
            forth graces in his right, as if it became him to proffer blessings <lb/>
            to all men from his ready store, and to display the best ar­ <lb/>
            rangement possible on his right hand, but to contract the <lb/>
            punishments which he had it in his power to inflict, and to <lb/>
            allot to them a more confined space on his left. And imme­ <lb/>
            diately there were established choruses, who had been carefully <lb/>
            trained, singing paeans to him, the same who had, a little while <lb/>
            before, called him Bacchus, and Evius, and Lyæus, and sang <lb/>
            Bacchic hymns in his honour when he assumed the disguise of <lb/>
            Bacchus.</p>
          <p>Very often, also, he would clothe himself with a breastplate, <lb/>
            and march forth sword in hand, with a helmet on his head and <lb/>
            a shield on his left arm, calling himself Mars, and on each <lb/>
            side of him there marched with him the attendants of this <lb/>
            new and unknown Mars, a troop of murderers and executioners <lb/>
            who had already performed him all kinds of wicked services <lb/>
            when he was raging and thirsting for human blood; and then <lb/>
            when men saw this they were amazed and terrified at the <lb/>
            marvellous sight, and they wondered how a man who did <lb/>
            exactly the contrary to what was done by those beings to whom <lb/>
            he claimed to be equal in honour, did not choose to imitate <lb/>
            their virtues, but assumed the outward character of each with <lb/>
            I the most abominable conduct. And yet all those ornaments <lb/>
            and decorations which belonged to them were attached to his <lb/>
            statues and images, which indicated by symbols the benefits <lb/>
            which the beings who are thus honoured confer upon the race <lb/>
            of mankind. Mercury, for instance, requires wings attached <lb/>
            to his ankles. Why so ? Is it not because it behoves him to <lb/>
            be the interpreter and declarer of the will of the gods (from <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            which employment, in fact, he derives his Greek name of <lb/>
            Hermes✻), announcing good news to mankind (for not only no <lb/>
            god but no sensible man ever will become the messenger of <lb/>
            evil), and therefore it is necessary for him to be exceedingly <lb/>
            swift-footed, and all but winged, from the unhesitating rapidity <lb/>
            with which he requires to proceed. Since it is right that <lb/>
            beneficial news should be announced with great promptness, <lb/>
            just as bad news ought to be brought slowly, unless indeed any <lb/>
            one should prefer saying that such ought to be entirely sup­ <lb/>
            pressed in silence.</p>
          <p>Again, he takes with him his caduceus or herald's wand, as <lb/>
            a token of reconciliation and peace, for wars receive their respites <lb/>
            and terminations by means of heralds, who restore peace ; and <lb/>
            wars which have no heralds to terminate them cause endless <lb/>
            calamities to both parties, both to those who invade their <lb/>
            neighbours and to those who are endeavouring to repel the <lb/>
            invasion. But for what purpose did Caius assume the winged <lb/>
            sandals of Mercury ? Was it because he wished to spread <lb/>
            with power, and rapidity, and loudness that miserable and <lb/>
            ill-omened intelligence which ought rather to be buried in <lb/>
            silence altogether, conveying his voice everywhere with un­ <lb/>
            ceasing eelerity ?</p>
          <p>And yet what need had he of such rapid motion ? for even <lb/>
            while standing still he poured forth unspeakable evils upon <lb/>
            evils as if from an unceasing fountain, showering them down <lb/>
            upon every portion of the habitable world. And of what use <lb/>
            was the herald's wand to him, who never either said or did <lb/>
            anything bearing upon peace, but who rather filled every <lb/>
            house and every city within Greece and in the countries of the <lb/>
            barbarians with civil wars? Let him, therefore, impostor that <lb/>
            he is, lay aside the name of Mercury, since by assuming it he <lb/>
            is only profaning an appellation which does not belong to him.</p>
          <p>XIV. Again, of all the attributes of Apollo, what is there <lb/>
            which in the least degree resembles his characteristics ? He <lb/>
            wears a crown emitting rays all around, the artist who made it <lb/>
            having given a most admirable representation of the beams of <lb/>
            the sun; but how can the sun, or in fact any light at all, be a <lb/>
            welcome object to him, and not rather night, or anything else, <lb/>
            if there be such more completely enveloped darkness, or even <lb/>
            anything darker than darkness itself, for the performance of <note type="footnote"> * i.e. from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑρμηνεύω</foreign>, "to interpret." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="122"/>
            his lawless actions ? Since good actions do require the bril­ <lb/>
            liancy of noonday for their proper display, but shameful actions, <lb/>
            as they say, are suited to the extreme depths of Tartarus, into <lb/>
            which they ought to be thrust in order to be concealed from <lb/>
            sight, as is becoming. Let him also transpose the things <lb/>
            which he bears in each of his hands, and not pollute the proper <lb/>
            arrangement, for let him bear his arrows and his bow in his <lb/>
            right hand, for he knows how with good aim to shoot at and to <lb/>
            pierce men and women, and whole families, and populous <lb/>
            cities, to their complete destruction. And let him either at <lb/>
            once throw away his graces altogether, or else let him keep <lb/>
            them in the shade in his left hand, for he has defaced their <lb/>
            beauty, directing all his eyes and exciting all his desires <lb/>
            against vast properties, so as to plunder them in an iniquitous <lb/>
            manner, in consequence of which their owners were murdered, <lb/>
            finding themselves unfortunate through their good fortune.</p>
          <p>But no doubt he with great felicity gave a new representa­ <lb/>
            tion of the medical skill of Apollo, for this god was the inventor <lb/>
            of healing medicines,. so as to cause health to men, thinking fit <lb/>
            himself to heal the diseases which were inflicted by others, by <lb/>
            reason of the excessive mildness and gentleness of his own <lb/>
            nature and habits, but this man, on the contrary, loads those <lb/>
            who are in good health with disease, and inflicts mutilations <lb/>
            on those who are sound, and in short visits the living with <lb/>
            most cruel death, caused by the hand of man before the time <lb/>
            of their natural death, preparing every imaginable engine of <lb/>
            destruction in abundant plenteousness, by means of which, if he <lb/>
            had not himself been previously put to death in accordance <note type="footnote"> o This is one of the attributes of Apollo of which he boasts to <lb/>
            Daphne. <lb/>

            the riches of all the rest of the habitable world had been <lb/>
            collected together from its most distant borders, it would have <lb/>
            been found to be very inferior in amount.</p>
          <p>On this account he began, he, this hater of the citizens, this? <lb/>
            devourer of the people, this pestilence, this destructive evil, <lb/>
            began to banish all the seeds of peace from his country, as if <lb/>
            he were expelling evil from holy ground; for Apollo is said to <lb/>
            have been not only a physician but also an excellent prophet, <lb/>
            by his oracular predictions announcing what was likely to con­ <lb/>
            duce to the advantage of mankind, in order that no one, being <lb/>
            overshadowed by uncertainty, going on without seeing his way <lb/>
            before him like a blind man, might hastily fall into unexpected <lb/>
            evils as if they were the greatest benefits; but that men having <lb/>
            previously acquired a knowledge of the future as if it were <lb/>
            really present, and looking at it with the eye of their mind, <lb/>
            might guard against future evils just as they can see evils <lb/>
            actually before them with the bodily eye, and in this way <lb/>
            secure themselves against any irremediable disaster.</p>
          <p>Is it fitting now to compare with these oracles of Apollo the <lb/>
            ill-omened warnings of Caius, by means of which poverty, and <lb/>
            dishonour, and banishment, and death were given premature <lb/>
            notice of to all those who were in power and authority in any <lb/>
            part of the world ? What connexion or resemblance was there <lb/>
            between him and Apollo, when he never paid any attention to <lb/>
            any ties of kindred or friendship? Let him cease, then, this <lb/>
            pretended Apollo, from imitating that real healer of mankind, <lb/>
            for the form of God is not a thing which is capable of being <lb/>
            imitated by an inferior one, as good money is imitated by bad.</p>
          <p>XV. A man, indeed, may expect anything rather than that <lb/>
            a man endowed with such a body and such a soul, when both <lb/>
            of them are effeminate and broken down, could ever possibly <lb/>
            be made like to the vigour of Mars in either particular; but <lb/>
            this man, like a mummer transforming himself on the stage, <lb/>
            putting on all sorts of masks one after another, sought to <lb/>
            deceive the spectators by a series of fictitious appearances. <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            Come, then, let him be subjected to an examination in respect <lb/>
            of all the particulars of his soul and body, by. reason of his <lb/>
            utter unlikeness to the aforesaid deity in every position and in <lb/>
            every motion. Was he not utterly unlike Mars, not in respect <lb/>
            only of his appearance as celebrated in fable, but as to his <lb/>
            natural qualities? Mars, who is endued with pre-eminent <lb/>
            valour, which we know to be a power calculated to avert evil, <lb/>
            to he the assistant and ally of all who are unjustly oppressed, <lb/>
            as indeed his very name shows, for he appears to me to be <lb/>
            called Mars from his helping,* which is the same as assisting, <lb/>
            being as such the god who is able to put down wars and to <lb/>
            cause peace, of which this representation of his was the enemy, <lb/>
            being the comrade of wars, and the man who changed peace and <lb/>
            stability into disorder and confusion.</p>
          <p>XVI. Have we not, then, learned from all these instances, <lb/>
            that Caius ought not to be likened to any god, and not even to <lb/>
            any demi-god, inasmuch as he has neither the same nature, nor <lb/>
            the same essence, nor even the same wishes and intentions as <lb/>
            any one of them; but appetite as it seems is a blind thing, and <lb/>
            ' especially so when it takes to itself vain-gloriousness and am­ <lb/>
            bition in conjunction with the greatest power, by which we <lb/>
            who were previously unfortunate are utterly destroyed, for he <lb/>
            regarded the Jews with most especial suspicion, as if they were <lb/>
            the only persons who cherished wishes opposed to his, and who <lb/>
            had been taught in a manner from their very swaddling-clothes <lb/>
            by their parents, and teachers, and instructors, and even before <lb/>
            that by their holy laws, and also by their unwritten maxims <lb/>
            and customs, to believe that there was but one God, their <lb/>
            Father and the Creator of the world; for all others, all men, <lb/>
            all women, all cities, all nations, every country and region of <lb/>
            the earth, I had almost said the whole of the inhabited world, <lb/>
            although groaning over what was taking place, did nevertheless <lb/>
            flatter him, dignifying him above measure, and helping to <lb/>
            increase his pride and arrogance; and some of them even <lb/>
            introduced the barbaric custom into Italy of falling down in <lb/>
            adoration before him, adulterating their native feelings of <lb/>
            Roman liberty.</p>
          <p>But the single nation of the Jews, being excepted from these <lb/>
            actions, was suspected by him of wishing to counteract his <note type="footnote"> . The Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρήγειν</foreign>, from which Philo supposes <foreign xml:lang="grc">Ἄρης</foreign>, the <lb/>
            Greek name of Mars, to be derived. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="125"/>
            desires, since it was accustomed to embrace voluntary death as <lb/>
            an entrance to immortality, for the sake of not permitting any <lb/>
            of their national or hereditary customs to be destroyed, even if <lb/>
            it were of the most trivial character, because, as is the case in <lb/>
            a house, it often happens that by the removal of one small part, <lb/>
            even those parts which appeared to be solidly established fall <lb/>
            down, being relaxed and brought to decay by the removal of <lb/>
            that one thing, but in this case what was put in motion was <lb/>
            not a trifle, but a thing of the very greatest importance, <lb/>
            namely, the erecting the created and perishable nature of a <lb/>
            man, as far at least as appearance went, into the uncreated and <lb/>
            imperishable nature of God, which the nation correctly judged <lb/>
            to be the most terrible of all impieties (for it would have been <lb/>
            easier to change a god into man, than a man into God), besides <lb/>
            the fact of such an action letting in other most enormous wick­ <lb/>
            edness, infidelity and ingratitude towards the Benefactor of <lb/>
            the whole world, who by his own power gives abundant supplies <lb/>
            of all kinds of blessings to every part of the universe.</p>
          <p>XVII. Therefore a most terrible and irreconcileable war <lb/>
            was prepared against our nation, for what could be a more <lb/>
            terrible evil to a slave than a master who was an enemy? <lb/>
            And his subjects are the slaves of the emperor, even if they <lb/>
            were not so to any one of the former emperors, because they <lb/>
            governed with gentleness and in accordance with the laws, but <lb/>
            now that Caius had eradicated all feelings of humanity from his <lb/>
            soul, and had admired lawlessness (for looking upon himself as <lb/>
            the law, he abrogated all the enactments of other lawgivers in <lb/>
            every state and country as so many vain sentences), we were <lb/>
            properly to be looked upon not only as slaves, but as the very <lb/>
            lowest and mose dishonoured of slaves, now that our ruler was <lb/>
            changed into our master.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And the mixed and promiscuous multitude of the <lb/>
            Alexandrians perceiving this, attacked us, looking upon it as <lb/>
            a most favourable opportunity for doing so, and displayed all <lb/>
            the arrogance which had been smouldering for a long period, <lb/>
            disturbing everything, and causing universal confusion, for they <lb/>
            began to crush our people as if they had been surrendered by <lb/>
            the emperor for the most extreme and undeniable miseries, or <lb/>
            as if they had been subdued in war, with their frantic and <lb/>
            most brutal passion, forcing their way into their houses, and <lb/>
            driving out the owners, with their wives and children, which <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            they rendered desolate and void of inhabitants. And no <lb/>
            longer watching for night and darkness, like ordinary <lb/>
            robbers out of fear of being detected, they openly plun­ <lb/>
            dered them of all their furniture and treasures, carrying <lb/>
            them off in broad daylight, and displaying their booty to <lb/>
            every one whom they met, as if they had inherited it or <lb/>
            fairly purchased it from the owners.</p>
          <p>And if a multitude joined together to share any particular <lb/>
            piece of plunder, they divided it in the middle of the market. <lb/>
            place, reviling it and turning it all into ridicule before the <lb/>
            eyes of its real owners. These things were of themselves <lb/>
            terrible and grievous; how could they be otherwise ? Surely <lb/>
            it was most miserable for men to become beggars from <lb/>
            having been wealthy, and to be reduced on a sudden from a <lb/>
            state of abundance to one of utter indigence, without having <lb/>
            done any wrong, and to be rendered houseless and homeless, <lb/>
            being driven out and expelled from their own houses, that <lb/>
            thus, being compelled to dwell in the open air day and night, <lb/>
            they might be destroyed by the burning heat of the sun or <lb/>
            by the cold of the night.</p>
          <p>Yet even these evils were lighter than those which I am <lb/>
            about to mention; for when the populace had driven <lb/>
            together these countless myriads of men, and women, and <lb/>
            children, like so many herds of sheep and oxen, from every <lb/>
            quarter of the city, into a very narrow space as if into a <lb/>
            pen, they expected that in a few days they should find a <lb/>
            heap of corpses all huddled together, as they would either <lb/>
            have perished by hunger through the want of necessary <lb/>
            food, as they had not prepared themselves with any thing <lb/>
            requisite, through a foreknowledge of the evils which <lb/>
            thus suddenly came upon them; or else through being <lb/>
            crushed and suffocated from want of any adequate space <lb/>
            to breathe in, all the air around them becoming tainted, and <lb/>
            all that there was of vivifying power in their respiration <lb/>
            being cut off, or, if one is to say the truth, utterly expelled, <lb/>
            by the breath of those who were expiring among them. By <lb/>
            which, each individual being inflamed, and in a manner <lb/>
            oppressed by a descent of fever upon him, inhaled a hot and <lb/>
            unwholesome breath through his nostrils and mouth, heap­ <lb/>
            in,-,, as the proverb has it, fire on fire; for the power which <lb/>
            resides in the inmost parts changed its nature, and became <lb/>
             <pb n="127"/>
            most excessively fiery; upon which, when the external <lb/>
            breezes, being moderately cool, blow, all the organs of the <lb/>
            respiratory powers flourish, and are in a good and healthy <lb/>
            condition; but when these breezes change and become hot, <lb/>
            then those organs must of necessity be in a bad state, fire <lb/>
            being added to fire.</p>
          <p>XIX. As they then were no longer able to endure the <lb/>
            misery of the place within which they were enclosed, they <lb/>
            poured forth into desolate parts of the wilderness, and to <lb/>
            the shore, and among the tombs, in their eagerness to find <lb/>
            any pure and untainted air. And if any of them had <lb/>
            previously been left in the other parts of the city, or if any <lb/>
            had come in thither from the fields out of ignorance of the <lb/>
            evils which had visited their companions, they fell into every <lb/>
            variety of misfortune, being stoned, or else wounded with <lb/>
            sharp tiles, or beaten on the most mortal parts of the body, <lb/>
            and especially on the head, with branches of maple and of <lb/>
            oak, in such a way as to cause death.</p>
          <p>And some of those persons who are accustomed to pass <lb/>
            their time in idleness and inaction, sitting around, occupied <lb/>
            themselves in watching those who, as I have said before, <lb/>
            were thus driven together and crammed into a very small <lb/>
            space, as if they were a force which they were blockading; <lb/>
            lest any one should secretly escape without their perceiving <lb/>
            it. And a great many were designing to effect their escape <lb/>
            from want of necessaries, disregarding their own safety from <lb/>
            a fear that, if they remained, the whole body might perish <lb/>
            with famine. So those men, expecting that they would <lb/>
            endeavour to escape, kept a continual watch, and the <lb/>
            moment that they caught any one, they immediately put <lb/>
            him to death with every circumstance of insult and cruelty.</p>
          <p>And there was another company lying in wait for them <lb/>
            on the quays of the river, to catch any Jews who arrived at <lb/>
            those spots, and to plunder them of every thing which they <lb/>
            brought for the purposes of traffic; for, forcing their way <lb/>
            into their ships they took out the cargo before the eyes of <lb/>
            its lawful owners, and then, binding the hands of the <lb/>
            merchants behind them, they burnt them alive, taking the <lb/>
            rudders, and helms, and punt-poles, and the benches for the <lb/>
            rowers to sit upon, for fuel. And thus these men perished <lb/>
            by a most miserable death being burnt alive in the middle <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            of the city; for sometimes, for want of other timber they <lb/>
            brought piles of faggots together, and tying them up, they <lb/>
            threw them on the miserable victims; and they, being <lb/>
            already half burnt, were killed, more by the smoke of the <lb/>
            green wood than by the flames, as the new faggots gave forth <lb/>
            only an unsubstantial and smoky sort of flame, and were <lb/>
            soon extinguished, not being able to be reduced to ashes by <lb/>
            reason of their lightness.</p>
          <p>And many who were still alive they took and bound, and <lb/>
            fastened their ankles together with thongs and ropes, and <lb/>
            then dragged them through the middle of the market-place, <lb/>
            leaping on them, and not sparing their corpses even after <lb/>
            they were dead; for, tearing them to pieces limb from limb, <lb/>
            and trampling on them, behaving with greater brutality <lb/>
            and ferocity than even the most savage beasts, they <lb/>
            destroyed every semblance of humanity about them, so that <lb/>
            not even a fragment of them was left to which the rites of <lb/>
            burial could be afforded.</p>
          <p>XX. But as the governor of the country, who by himself <lb/>
            could, if he had chosen to do so, have put down the violence <lb/>
            of the multitude in a single hour, pretended not to see what <lb/>
            he did see, and not to hear what he did hear, but allowed <lb/>
            the mob to carry on the war against our people without any <lb/>
            restraint, and threw our former state of tranquillity into <lb/>
            confusion, the populace being excited still more, proceeded <lb/>
            onwards to still more shameless and more audacious designs <lb/>
            and treachery, and, arraying very numerous companies, cut <lb/>
            down some of the synagogues (and there are a great many <lb/>
            in every section of the city), and some they razed to the <lb/>
            very foundations, and into some they threw fire and burnt <lb/>
            them, in their insane madness and frenzy, without caring <lb/>
            for the neighbouring houses; for there is nothing more <lb/>
            rapid than fire, when it lays hold of fuel.</p>
          <p>I omit to mention the ornaments in honour of the <lb/>
            emperor, which were destroyed and burnt with these <lb/>
            synagogues, such as gilded shields, and gilded crowns, and <lb/>
            pillars, and inscriptions, for the sake of which they ought <lb/>
            even to have abstained from and spared the other things ; <lb/>
            but they were full of confidence, inasmuch as they did not <lb/>
            fear any chastisement at the hand of Caius, as they well <lb/>
            knew that he cherished an indescribable hatred against the <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            Jews, so that their opinion was that no one could do him a <lb/>
            more acceptable service than by inflicting every description <lb/>
            of injury on the nation which he hated; and, as they wished <lb/>
            to curry favour with him by a novel kind of flattery, so as to <lb/>
            allow, and for the future to give the rein to, every sort of ill <lb/>
            treatment of us without ever being called to account, what <lb/>
            did they proceed to do? All the synagogues that they <lb/>
            were unable to destroy by burning and razing them to the <lb/>
            ground, because a great number of Jews lived in a dense <lb/>
            mass in the neighbourhood, they injured and defaced in <lb/>
            another manner, simultaneously with a total overthrow of <lb/>
            their laws and customs; for they set up in every one of <lb/>
            them images of Caius, and in the greatest, and most <lb/>
            conspicuous, and most celebrated of them they erected a <lb/>
            brazen statue of him borne on a four-horse chariot. And so <lb/>
            excessive and impetuous was the rapidity of their zeal, that, <lb/>
            as they had not a new chariot for four horses ready, they <lb/>
            got a very old one out of the gymnasium, full of poison, <lb/>
            mutilated in its ears, and in the hinder part, and in its <lb/>
            pedestal, and in many other points, and as some say, one <lb/>
            which had already been dedicated in honour of a woman, the <lb/>
            eminent Cleopatra, who was the great grandmother of the <lb/>
            last.</p>
          <p>Now what amount of accusation he brought against those <lb/>
            who had dedicated this chariot on this very account is <lb/>
            notorious to every one; for what did it signify if it was a <lb/>
            new one and belonging to a woman ? Or what if it was an <lb/>
            old one and belonging to a man ? And what, in short, if it <lb/>
            was wholly dedicated to the name of some one else ? Was it <lb/>
            not natural that those who were offering up a chariot of this <lb/>
            sort on behalf of the emperor should be full of cautious fear, <lb/>
            lest some one might lay an information against them before <lb/>
            our emperor, who took such especial care that every thing <lb/>
            which at all affected or related to himself should be done in <lb/>
            the most dignified manner possible ?</p>
          <p>But these men expected to be most extravagantly praised, <lb/>
            and to receive greater and more conspicuous advantages as <lb/>
            rewards for their conduct, in thus dedicating the synagogues <lb/>
            to Caius as new pieces of consecrated ground, not because <lb/>
            of the honour which was done to him by this proceeding, <lb/>
            but because in this way they exhausted every possible means <note type="footnote"> TOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            of insulting and injuring our nation. And one may find <lb/>
            undeniable and notorious proofs of this' having been the <lb/>
            case.</p>
          <p>For, in the first place, one may derive them from about <lb/>
            ten kings or more who reigned in order, one after another, <lb/>
            for three hundred years, and who never once had any images <lb/>
            or statues of themselves erected in our synagogues, though <lb/>
            there were many of their relations and kinsmen whom they <lb/>
            considered, and registered as, and spoke of as gods. And <lb/>
            what would they not have done in the case of those whom <lb/>
            they looked upon as men ? a people who look upon dogs, <lb/>
            and wolves, and lions, and crocodiles, and numerous other <lb/>
            beasts, both terrestrial and aquatic, and numerous birds, as <lb/>
            gods, and erect in their honour altars, and temples, and <lb/>
            shrines, and consecrated precincts, throughout the whole of <lb/>
            Egypt ?</p>
          <p>XXI. Perhaps some people who would not have opened <lb/>
            their mouths then will say now: " They were accustomed <lb/>
            to pay respect to the good deeds done by their govern­ <lb/>
            ors rather than to their governors themselves, because <lb/>
            the emperors are greater than the Ptolemies, both in <lb/>
            their dignities and in their fortunes, and are justly entitled <lb/>
            to receive higher honours. Then, 0 ye most foolish of <lb/>
            all mankind! that I may not be compelled to utter any <lb/>
            thing disrespectful or blasphemous, why did you never <lb/>
            think Tiberius, who was emperor before Caius, who indeed <lb/>
            was the cause that Caius ever became emperor, who himself <lb/>
            enjoyed the supreme power by land and sea for three and <lb/>
            twenty years, and who never allowed any seed of war to <lb/>
            smoulder or to raise its head, either in Greece or in the <lb/>
            territory of the barbarians, and who bestowed peace and the <lb/>
            blessings of peace up to the end of his life with a rich and <lb/>
            most bounteous hand and mind upon the whole empire and the <lb/>
            whole world; why, I say, did you not consider him worthy <lb/>
            of similar honour P Was he inferior in birth ? No ; he was <lb/>
            of the most noble blood by both parents. Was he inferior <lb/>
            in his education ? Who, of all the men who flourished in <lb/>
            his time, was either more prudent or more eloquent P Or <lb/>
            in his age ? What king or emperor ever lived to more <lb/>
            prosperous old age than he ? Moreover, he, even while he <lb/>
            was still a young man, was called the old man as a mark of <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            respect because of his exceeding wisdom. This man, though <lb/>
            he was so wise, and so good, and so great, was passed over <lb/>
            and disregarded by you.</p>
          <p>Again, why did you not pay similar honour to him who <lb/>
            exceeded the common race of human nature in every virtue, <lb/>
            who, by reason of the greatness of his absolute power and <lb/>
            his own excellence, was the first man to be called Augustus, <lb/>
            not receiving the title after another by a succession of blood <lb/>
            as a part of his inheritance, but who was himself the origin <lb/>
            of his successors, having that title and honour ? He who <lb/>
            first became emperor, when all the affairs of the state were <lb/>
            in disorder and confusion; for the islands were in a state of <lb/>
            war against the continents, and the continents were con­ <lb/>
            tending with the islands for the pre-eminence in honour, <lb/>
            each having for their leaders and champions the most <lb/>
            powerful and eminent of the Romans who were in office. <lb/>
            And then again, great sections of Asia were contending <lb/>
            against Europe, and Europe against Asia, for the chief power <lb/>
            and dominion ;* the European and Asiatic nations rising up <lb/>
            from the extremities of the earth, and waging terrible wars <lb/>
            against one another over all the earth, and over every sea, <lb/>
            with enormous armaments, so that very nearly the whole <lb/>
            race of mankind would have been destroyed by mutual <lb/>
            slaughter and made utterly to disappear, if it had not been <note type="footnote"> * He alludes here to the war between Cresar and Pompey. Pompey <lb/>

            for one man and leader, Augustus, by whose means they <lb/>
            were brought to a better state, and therefore we may justly <lb/>
            call him the averter of evil.</p>
          <p>This is Cæsar, who calmed the storms which were raging <lb/>
            in every direction, who healed the common diseases which <lb/>
            were afflicting both Greeks and barbarians, who descended <lb/>
            from the south and from the east, and ran on and penetrated <lb/>
            as far as the north and the west, in such a way as to fill all <lb/>
            the neighbouring districts and waters with unexpected <lb/>
            miseries. This is he who did not only loosen but utterly <lb/>
            abolish the bonds in which the whole of the habitable world <lb/>
            was previously bound and weighed down. This is he who <lb/>
            destroyed both the evident and the unseen wars which arose <lb/>
            from the attacks of robbers. This is he who rendered the <lb/>
            sea free from the vessels of pirates, and filled it with <lb/>
            merchantmen.* This is he who gave freedom to every <lb/>
            city, who brought disorder into order, who civilized and <lb/>
            made obedient and harmonious, nations which before his <lb/>
            time were unsociable, hostile, and brutal. This is he who <lb/>
            increased Greece by many Greeces, and who Greecised the <lb/>
            regions of the barbarians in their most important divisions: <lb/>
            the guardian of peace, the distributor to every man of what <lb/>
            was suited to him, the man who proffered to all the citizens <lb/>
            favours with the most ungrudging liberality, who never once <lb/>
            in his whole life concealed or reserved for himself any thing <lb/>
            that was good or excellent.</p>
          <p>XXII. Now this man who was so- great a benefactor to <lb/>
            them for the space of three and forty years, during which <lb/>
            he reigned over Egypt, they passed over in silence and <lb/>
            neglect, never erecting any thing in their synagogues to do <lb/>
            him honour; no image, no statue, no inscription.</p>
          <p>And yet if ever there was a man to whom it was proper <lb/>
            that new and unprecedented honours should be voted, it was <lb/>
            certainly fitting that such should be decreed to him, not <lb/>
            only because he was as it were the origin and fountain of <lb/>
            the family of Augustus, not because he was the first, and <lb/>
            greatest, and universal benefactor, having, instead of the <lb/>
            multitude of governors who existed before, entrusted the <lb/>
            common vessel of the state to himself as one pilot of <note type="footnote"> * He is attributing an honour to Augustus which does not belong to <lb/>
            him. It was Pompey who cleared the sea of pirates. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            admirable skill in the science of governments to steer and <lb/>
            govern; for the verse, <lb/>
            “ The government of many is not good,”* <lb/>
            is very properly expressed, since a multitude of votes is the <lb/>
            cause of every variety of evil; but also because the whole of <lb/>
            the rest of the habitable world had decreed him honours equal <lb/>
            to those of the Olympian gods. And we have evidence of <lb/>
            this in the temples, and porticoes, and sacred precincts, and <lb/>
            groves, and colonnades which have been erected, so that all <lb/>
            the cities put together, ancient and modern, which exhibit <lb/>
            magnificent works, are surpassed, by the beauty and magni­ <lb/>
            tude of the buildings erected in honour of Cæsar, and <lb/>
            especially by those raised in our city of Alexandria.</p>
          <p>For there is no sacred precinct of such magnitude as that <lb/>
            which is called the Grove of Augustus, and the temple <lb/>
            erected in honour of the disembarkation of Cæsar, which is <lb/>
            raised to a great height, of great size, and of the most <lb/>
            conspicuous beauty, opposite the best harbour; being such <lb/>
            an one as is not to be seen in any other city, and full of <lb/>
            offerings, in pictures, and statues; and decorated all around <lb/>
            with silver and gold; being a very extensive space, orna­ <lb/>
            mented in the most magnificent and sumptuous manner with <lb/>
            porticoes, and libraries, and men's chambers, and groves, and <lb/>
            propylæa, and wide, open terraces, and court-yards in the <lb/>
            open air, and with everything that could contribute to use <lb/>
            or beauty ; being a hope and beacon of safety to all who set <lb/>
            sail, or who came into harbour.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Therefore, though they had such admirable pre­ <lb/>
            texts for such conduct, and all the nations in every part of <lb/>
            the world inclined to agree with them, they nevertheless <lb/>
            neither made any innovations in their synagogues, but kept <lb/>
            the law in every particular; and refused any marks of <lb/>
            respect and veneration which might have been looked upon <lb/>
            as due to Caesar. Perhaps some cautious and sensible <lb/>
            person may ask: " Why were all these honours denied to <lb/>
            him?" I will tell the reason, without suppressing any <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>They were aware of the attention which he paid to every <lb/>
            thing, and of the very exceeding care which he took that the <note type="footnote"> * Horn. II. ii. 204. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="134"/>
            national laws and customs prevailing in each nation should <lb/>
            be confirmed and preserved, being equally anxious for the <lb/>
            preservation of the rights of foreign nations in this respect, <lb/>
            as for those of the Romans; and that he received his <lb/>
            honours, not for the destruction of the laws existing in any <lb/>
            people, filling himself with pride and arrogance, but in a <lb/>
            spirit of proper conformity with the magnitude of so vast an <lb/>
            empire, which is dignified and honoured by such marks of <lb/>
            respect being paid to the emperor.</p>
          <p>And there is most undeniable proof that he was never <lb/>
            'influenced or puffed up by the excessive honours paid to <lb/>
            ihim, in the fact that he did not approve of any one's <lb/>
            addressing him as master or god, but if any one used such <lb/>
            expressions he was angry; and we may see it too in his <lb/>
            approbation of the Jews, who he well knew most reli­ <lb/>
            giously avoided all such language.</p>
          <p>How then did he look upon the great division of Rome <lb/>
            which is on the other side of the river Tiber, which he was <lb/>
            well aware was occupied and inhabited by the Jews ? And <lb/>
            they were mostly Roman citizens, having been emancipated; <lb/>
            for, having been brought as captives into Italy, they were <lb/>
            manumitted by those who had bought them for slaves, with­ <lb/>
            out ever having been compelled to alter any of their <lb/>
            hereditary or national observances. Therefore, he knew <lb/>
            that they had synagogues, and that they were in the habit <lb/>
            of visiting them, and most especially on the sacred sabbath <lb/>
            days, when they publicly cultivate their national philosophy. <lb/>
            He knew also that they were in the habit of contributing <lb/>
            sacred sums of money from their first fruits and sending <lb/>
            them to Jerusalem by the hands of those who were to <lb/>
            conduct the sacrifices. But he never removed them from <lb/>
            Rome, nor did he ever deprive them of their rights as <lb/>
            Roman citizens, because he had a regard for Judæa, nor did <lb/>
            he ever meditate any new steps of innovation or rigour <lb/>
            with respect to their synagogues, nor did he forbid their <lb/>
            assembling for the interpretation of the law, nor did he <lb/>
            make any opposition to their offerings of first fruits ; but he <lb/>
            behaved with such piety towards our countrymen, and with <lb/>
            respect to all our customs, that he, I may almost say, with <lb/>
            all his house, adorned our temple with many costly and <lb/>
            magnificent offerings, commanding that continued sacrifices <lb/>
             <pb n="135"/>
            of whole burnt offerings should be offered up for ever and <lb/>
            ever every day from his own revenues, as a first fruit of his <lb/>
            own to the most high God, which sacrifices are performed to <lb/>
            this very day, and will be performed for ever, as a proof and <lb/>
            specimen of a truly imperial disposition.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in the monthly divisions of the country, when <lb/>
            the whole people receives money or corn in turn, he never <lb/>
            allowed the Jews to fall short in their reception of this <lb/>
            favour, but even if it happened that this distribution fell on <lb/>
            the day of their sacred sabbath, on which day it is not lawful <lb/>
            for them to receive any thing, or to give any thing, or in <lb/>
            short to perform any of the ordinary duties of life, he <lb/>
            charged the dispenser of these gifts, and gave him the most <lb/>
            careful and special injunctions to make the distribution to <lb/>
            the Jews on the day following, that they might not lose the <lb/>
            effects of his common kindness.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Therefore, all people in every country, even if <lb/>
            they were not naturally well inclined towards the Jewish <lb/>
            nation, took great care not to violate or attack any of the <lb/>
            Jewish customs or laws. And in the reign of Tiberius <lb/>
            things went on in the same manner, although at that time <lb/>
            things in Italy were thrown into a great deal of confusion <lb/>
            when Sejanus was preparing to make his attempt against <lb/>
            our nation; for he knew immediately after his death that <lb/>
            the accusations which had been brought against the Jews <lb/>
            who were dwelling in Rome were false calumnies, inventions <lb/>
            of Sejanus, who was desirous to destroy our nation, which <lb/>
            he knew alone, or above all others, was likely to oppose his <lb/>
            unholy counsels and actions in defence of the emperor, who <lb/>
            was in great danger of being attacked, in violation of all <lb/>
            treaties and of all honesty.</p>
          <p>And he sent commands to all the governors of provinces <lb/>
            in every country to comfort those of our nation in their <lb/>
            respective cities, as the punishment intended to be inflicted <lb/>
            was not meant to be inflicted upon all, but only on the <lb/>
            guilty; and they were but few. And he ordered them to <lb/>
            change none of the existing customs, but to look upon them <lb/>
            as pledges, since the men were peaceful in their dispositions <lb/>
            and natural characters, and their laws trained them and <lb/>
            disposed them to quiet and stability.</p>
          <p>XXV. But Caius puffed himself up with pride, not only <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            saying, but actually thinking that he was a god. And then <lb/>
            he found no people, whether among the Greeks or among <lb/>
            the barbarians, more suitable than the Alexandrians to <lb/>
            confirm him in his immoderate and unnatural ambition; for <lb/>
            they are in an extraordinary degree inclined to flattery, and <lb/>
            trick, and hypocrisy, being thoroughly furnished with all <lb/>
            kinds of cajoling words, and prone to confuse every thing <lb/>
            with their unbridled and licentious talk. And the name of <lb/>
            God is held in so little veneration among them, that they <lb/>
            have given it to ibises, and to the poisonous asps which are <lb/>
            found in their country, and to many other savage beasts <lb/>
            which exist in it. So that they, very naturally, giving in <lb/>
            to all kinds of addresses and invocations to him, addressed <lb/>
            him as God, deceiving men of shallow comprehension, who <lb/>
            were wholly inexperienced in the impiety prevailing in <lb/>
            Egypt, though they are detected by those who are ac­ <lb/>
            quainted with their excessive folly, or, I should rather say, <lb/>
            with their preposterous impiety.</p>
          <p>Of which, Cams, having no experience, imagined that he <lb/>
            was really believed by the Alexandrians to be God, since <lb/>
            they, without any disguise, openly and plainly used all the <lb/>
            appellations without any limitation, with which they were <lb/>
            accustomed to invoke the other gods. In the next place, he <lb/>
            believed that the innovations which they made with respect <lb/>
            to their synagogues, were all made with a pure conscience, <lb/>
            and from a sincere honour and respect for him, partly being <lb/>
            influenced by the ephemerides in the way of memorial, which <lb/>
            some persons sent him from Alexandria; for these things <lb/>
            were what he very much delighted to read, to such a degree <lb/>
            that the writings of all other authors, whether in prose or in <lb/>
            poetry, were looked upon by him as absolutely odious in <lb/>
            comparison with the delight which these documents afforded <lb/>
            him, and partly by the language of some of his domestics, <lb/>
            who were continually jesting with him and ridiculing all <lb/>
            serious things.</p>
          <p>XXVI. The greater portion of these men were Egyptians, <lb/>
            wicked, worthless men, who had imprinted the venom and <lb/>
            evil disposition of their native asps and crocodiles on their <lb/>
            own souls, and gave a faithful representation of them there. <lb/>
            And the leader of the whole Egyptian troops, like the cory­ <lb/>
            phæus of a chorus, was a man of the name of Helicon, an <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            accursed and infamous slave, who had been introduced into <lb/>
            the imperial household to its ruin; for he had acquired a <lb/>
            slight smattering of the encyclical sciences, by imitation of <lb/>
            and rivalry with his former master, who gave him to Tiberius <lb/>
            Cæsar. And at that time he had no especial privilege, since <lb/>
            Tiberius had a perfect hatred of all youthful sallies of wit <lb/>
            for the mere purposes of amusement, as he, from almost his <lb/>
            earliest youth, was of a solemn and austere disposition.</p>
          <p>But when Tiberius was dead, and Caius succeeded to the <lb/>
            empire, he then, following a new master, who invited him to <lb/>
            every description of relaxation and luxury, such as could <lb/>
            delight every one of his outward senses, said to himself: <lb/>
            "Rise up, 0 Helicon! now is your opportunity. You have <lb/>
            now an auditor, and a spectator, who is of all men in the <lb/>
            world the best calculated to receive the exhibition of your <lb/>
            talents favourably. You are a man of very attractive <lb/>
            natural talents. You are able to joke graceful, and to say <lb/>
            witty, things beyond any one else. You are skilful in all <lb/>
            kinds of amusements, and trifling, and fashionable sports. <lb/>
            And you are equally accomplished in those branches of <lb/>
            encyclical education which are not so ordinarily met with. <lb/>
            Moreover, you have a readiness of speech and repartee <lb/>
            which is far from unpleasing. If therefore you mingle with <lb/>
            your jestings any little stimulus which is in the least un­ <lb/>
            welcome or painful, so as to excite not only laughter but <lb/>
            any feelings of bitterness, on the part of one who is always <lb/>
            ready to suspect evil, you will 'be deliberately alienating <lb/>
            from yourself a master who is very well inclined by nature <lb/>
            to listen to any accusations which are brought before him in <lb/>
            a joking manner; for his ears, as you well know, are always <lb/>
            open, and are constantly on the watch to listen to all those <lb/>
            who are in the habit of interweaving accusations of others <lb/>
            with their sycophancy, And do not seek for any more <lb/>
            abundant causes ; for you have a sufficient foundation with <lb/>
            respect to the customs of the Jews and the national laws of <lb/>
            that people, in which you yourself were bred up, and in <lb/>
            which you have been instructed from your very earliest <lb/>
            childhood, not by one man only, but by that most chattering <lb/>
            and vexatious portion of the city of Alexandria. So now, <lb/>
            make an exhibition of your learning."</p>
          <p>XXVII. By these preposterous and accursed arguments <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            he excited his own expectations, and trained himself, and <lb/>
            inflamed his own wishes; and then he attended upon and <lb/>
            courted Caius, day and night, never leaving him for a <lb/>
            moment, but being with him at all times and on all occa­ <lb/>
            sions, and employing every moment when he was by himself, <lb/>
            or when he was resting, to pour forth accusations against <lb/>
            our nation, like a most infamous man as he was, exciting <lb/>
            pleasure in the mind of the emperor by ridiculing the Jews <lb/>
            and their laws and customs, that thus his calumnies might <lb/>
            wound us the more effectually; for he never openly con­ <lb/>
            fessed himself to be our accuser, nor could he in fact make <lb/>
            such a confession; but he went by all kinds of crooked <lb/>
            paths, and practised every sort of manoeuvre, and thus was a <lb/>
            more dangerous and formidable enemy than even those men <lb/>
            who openly recorded their hatred of and hostility towards <lb/>
            us.</p>
          <p>They say also that some of the ambassadors of the Alex­ <lb/>
            andrians, being completely aware of this, had secretly hired <lb/>
            him by considerable bribes, and not only by money but by <lb/>
            hopes of future honours, which they led him to expect he <lb/>
            might attain to at no distant period, when Caius should <lb/>
            come to Alexandria. And he, being continually declaiming <lb/>
            of that time in which, while his master was present, and in <lb/>
            conjunction with him, he should be almost supreme in his <lb/>
            power over a large portion of the world (for it was notorious <lb/>
            enough that by his assiduous courting of Caius, he would be <lb/>
            able to acquire power over the most illustrious portion of <lb/>
            the citizens, and over all those who are held in especial <lb/>
            honour by the most magnificent and glorious city,* promised <lb/>
            every thing).</p>
          <p>We, therefore, being for a long time unsuspicious of this <lb/>
            natural enemy, who was plotting against us from his con­ <lb/>
            cealment, took precautions only against our external foes; <lb/>
            but when we perceived that he too was to be guarded <lb/>
            against, we searched into the matter carefully, considering <lb/>
            every expedient to see if we could, by any means, propitiate <lb/>
            and conciliate the man who was thus aiming and shooting <lb/>
            at us, by every means and from every place, with great ac­ <lb/>
            curacy of aim and power of injuring us; for he was in the <lb/>
            habit of playing at ball with him, and of exercising himself <note type="footnote"> * There seems some corruption in the text here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            in gymnastic sports with him, and of bathing with him, and <lb/>
            breakfasting with him, and he was with Cams when he was <lb/>
            wont to go to rest, filling the part of chamberlain and chief <lb/>
            body-guard to him, an office which was not entrusted to any <lb/>
            one else, so that he alone had all kinds of favourable oppor­ <lb/>
            tunities for being listened to at leisure by the emperor, <lb/>
            when he was removed from any external tumults and dis­ <lb/>
            tractions, and able quietly to hear what he principally <lb/>
            desired.</p>
          <p>And he mingled numbers of satirical and quizzing observ­ <lb/>
            ations with his more formal and serious accusations, in order <lb/>
            to excite pleasure in his hearers by that means, and to do us <lb/>
            the greatest possible amount of injury; for the quizzing <lb/>
            and ridiculing appeared, as he used it, to be the principal <lb/>
            object at which he aimed, though it was in reality only his <lb/>
            indirect one; and the accusations which he launched against <lb/>
            us appeared to be mere casual observations, dropped acci­ <lb/>
            dentally, though in reality they were his primary and sole <lb/>
            object, while he was trying every expedient possible, and so, <lb/>
            like sailors who have a fair wind blowing on their stern, he <lb/>
            was borne onwards with a full sail before a favourable gale, <lb/>
            heaping upon us and stringing together one accusation after <lb/>
            another, while the mind of his hearer was fashioned in a <lb/>
            more solid and retentive mould, so that the recollection ot <lb/>
            the accusations was not easily eradicated.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Accordingly, we being in a great strait and in <lb/>
            most difficult circumstances, we, though we had availed <lb/>
            ourselves of every expedient which we could possibly think <lb/>
            of in order to propitiate and conciliate Helicon, could find <lb/>
            no means of doing so and no access to him, since no one <lb/>
            dared either to accost or to approach him, by reason of his <lb/>
            exceeding insolence and cruelty with which he behaved to <lb/>
            every one; and also because we were not aware, whether <lb/>
            there was any especial reason for his alienation from the <lb/>
            Jewish nation; since he was also exciting and exasperating <lb/>
            his master against our people, and, accordingly, we left on <lb/>
            labouring at this point, and turned our attention to what <lb/>
            was of greater importance.</p>
          <p>For it appeared good to present to Caius a memorial, con­ <lb/>
            taining a summary of what we had suffered, and of the way <lb/>
            in which we considered that we deserved to be treated; and <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            this memorial was nearly an abridgment of a longer petition <lb/>
            which we had sent to him a short time before, by the hand <lb/>
            of king Agrippa; for be, by chance, was staying for a short <lb/>
            time in the city, while on his way into Syria to take pos­ <lb/>
            session of the kingdom which had been given to him; but <lb/>
            we, without being aware of it, were deceiving ourselves, for <lb/>
            before also we had done the same, when we originally <lb/>
            began to set sail, thinking that as we were going before a <lb/>
            judge we should meet with justice; but he was in reality an <lb/>
            irreconcilable enemy to us, attracting us, as far as appear­ <lb/>
            ance went, with favourable looks and cheerful address; for, <lb/>
            receiving us favourably at first, in the plains on the banks <lb/>
            of the Tiber (for he happened to be walking about in his <lb/>
            mother's garden), he conversed with us formally, and waved <lb/>
            his right hand to us in a protecting manner, giving us sig­ <lb/>
            nificant tokens of his good will, and having sent to us the <lb/>
            secretary, whose duty it was to attend to the embassies that <lb/>
            arrived, Obulus by name, he said, " 1 myself will listen to <lb/>
            what you have to say at the first favourable opportunity."</p>
          <p>So that all those who stood around congratulated usas if <lb/>
            we had already carried our point, and so did all those of our <lb/>
            own people, who are influenced by superficial appearances. <lb/>
            But I myself, who was accounted to be possessed of superior <lb/>
            prudence, both on account of my age and my education, and <lb/>
            general information, was less sanguine in respect of the <lb/>
            matters at which the others were so greatly delighted. <lb/>
            " For why," said I, after pondering the matter deeply in <lb/>
            my own heart, " why, when there have been such numbers <lb/>
            of ambassadors, who have come, one may almost say, from <lb/>
            every corner of the globe, did he say on that occasion that <lb/>
            he would hear what we had to say, and no one else ? What <lb/>
            could have been his meaning ? for he was not ignorant that <lb/>
            we were Jews, who would have been quite content at not <lb/>
            being treated worse than the others; but to expect to be <lb/>
            looked upon as worthy to receive especial privileges and <lb/>
            precedence, by a master who was of a different nation and <lb/>
            a young man and an absolute monarch, would have seemed <lb/>
            like insanity. But it would seem that he was showing <lb/>
            civility to the whole district of the Alexandrians, to which <lb/>
            he was thus giving a privilege, when promising to give his <lb/>
            decision speedily; unless, indeed, disregarding the character <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            of a fair and impartial hearer, he was intending to be a <lb/>
            fellow suitor with our adversaries and an enemy of ours, <lb/>
            instead of behaving like a judge."</p>
          <p>XXIX. Having these ideas in my mind, I resisted the <lb/>
            sanguine hopes of the others, and had no rest in my mind <lb/>
            day or night. But while I was thus giving way to de­ <lb/>
            spondency and lamenting over my ignorance of the future <lb/>
            (for it was not safe to postpone matters), on a sudden <lb/>
            another most grievous and unexpected calamity fell upon <lb/>
            us, bringing danger not on one section of the Jews only, but <lb/>
            on all the nation together. For we had come from Rome to <lb/>
            Dicæarchia attending upon Caius ; and he had gone down to <lb/>
            the sea-side and was remaining near the gulf, having left for <lb/>
            a while his own palaces, which were numerous and superbly <lb/>
            furnished. And while we were anxiously considering his <lb/>
            intentions, for we were continually expecting to be sum­ <lb/>
            moned, a man arrived, with blood-shot eyes, and looking <lb/>
            very much troubled, out of breath and palpitating, and <lb/>
            leading us away to a little distance from the rest (for there <lb/>
            were several persons near), he said, " Have you heard the <lb/>
            news?" And then when he was about to tell us what it <lb/>
            was he stopped, because of the abundance of tears that rose <lb/>
            up to choke his utterance. And beginning again, he was a <lb/>
            second and a third time stopped in the same manner. And <lb/>
            we, seeing this, were much alarmed and agitated by suspense, <lb/>
            and entreated him to tell us what the circumstance was on <lb/>
            account of which he said that he had come ; for he could not <lb/>
            have come merely to weep before so many witnesses. " If, <lb/>
            then," said we, " you have any real cause for tears, do not <lb/>
            keep your grief to yourself; we have been long ago well <lb/>
            accustomed to misfortune."</p>
          <p>And he with difficulty, sobbing aloud, and in a broken <lb/>
            voice, spoke as follows: " Our temple is destroyed! Caius <lb/>
            has ordered a colossal statue of himself to be erected in <lb/>
            the holy of holies, having his own name inscribed upon it <lb/>
            with the title of Jupiter!" And while we were all struck <lb/>
            dumb with astonishment and terror at what he had told us, <lb/>
            and stood still deprived of all motion (for we stood there <lb/>
            mute and in despair, ready to fall to the groud with fear and <lb/>
            sorrow, the very muscles of our bodies being deprived of all <lb/>
            ' strength by the news which we had heard); others arrived <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            bearing the same sad tale. And then we all retired and <lb/>
            shut ourselves up together and bewailed our individual and <lb/>
            common miseries, and went through every circumstance that <lb/>
            our minds could conceive, for a man in misfortune is a most <lb/>
            loquacious animal, wrestling as we might with our misery. <lb/>
            And we said to one another, " We have sailed hither in the <lb/>
            middle of winter, in order that we might not be all involved <lb/>
            in violation of the law and in misfortunes proceeding from <lb/>
            it, without being aware what a winter of misery was await­ <lb/>
            ing us on shore, far more grievous than any storm at sea. <lb/>
            For of the one nature is the cause, which has divided the <lb/>
            seasons of the year and arranged them in due order, but <lb/>
            nature is a thing which exerts a saving power; but the other <lb/>
            storm is caused by a man who cherishes no ideas such as <lb/>
            become a man, but is a young man, and a promoter of all <lb/>
            kinds of innovation, being invested with irresponsible power <lb/>
            over all the world.</p>
          <p>" And youth, when combined with absolute power and <lb/>
            yielding to irresistible and unrestrained passion, is an <lb/>
            invincible evil. And will it be allowed to us to approach <lb/>
            him or to open our mouth on the subject of the synagogues <lb/>
            before this insulter of our holy and glorious temple ? For <lb/>
            it is quite evident that he will pay no regard whatever to <lb/>
            things of less importance and which are held in inferior <lb/>
            estimation, when he behaves with insolence and contempt <lb/>
            towards our most beautiful and renowned temple, which is <lb/>
            respected by all the east and by all the west, and regarded <lb/>
            like the sun which shines everywhere. And even if we were <lb/>
            allowed free access to him, what else could we expect but an <lb/>
            inexorable sentence of death ? But be it so; we will perish, <lb/>
            For, indeed, a glorious death in defence of and for the sake <lb/>
            of the preservation of our laws, is a kind of life.</p>
          <p>" But, indeed, if no advantage is derived from our death, <lb/>
            would it not be insanity to perish in addition to what we now <lb/>
            have to endure, and this too, while we appear to be ambas­ <lb/>
            sadors, so that the calamity appears rather to affect those <lb/>
            who have sent us than those who remain ? Not but what <lb/>
            those of our fellow countrymen who are by nature most <lb/>
            inclined to detest all wickedness, will accuse us of impiety, <lb/>
            as if we, in the extremity of dangers, when our whole <lb/>
            country was tossed about and threatened, were remembering <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            some private interests of our own out of selfishness. For it <lb/>
            is necessary that small things must yield to great ones, and <lb/>
            that private objects must yield to the general interests; <lb/>
            since, when they are destroyed, there is an end of the con­ <lb/>
            stitution and of the nation. For how can it be holy or <lb/>
            lawful for us to struggle in any other manner, pointing out <lb/>
            that we are citizens of Alexandria, over whom a danger is <lb/>
            now impending, that namely, of the utter destruction of the <lb/>
            general constitution of the Jewish nation; for in the de­ <lb/>
            struction of the temple there is reason to fear that this man, <lb/>
            so fond of innovation and willing to dare the most audacious <lb/>
            actions, will also order the general name of our whole nation <lb/>
            to be abolished.</p>
          <p>" If, therefore, both the objects on account of which we <lb/>
            were sent are overthrown, perhaps some one will say, What <lb/>
            then, did they not know that they had to negotiate for a safe <lb/>
            return ? But I would reply to such a man, You either have <lb/>
            not the genuine feelings of a nobly born man, or else you <lb/>
            were not educated like one, and have never been trained in <lb/>
            the knowledge of the sacred scriptures; for men who are <lb/>
            truly noble are full of hope, and the laws too implant good <lb/>
            hopes in all those who do not study them superficially but <lb/>
            with all their hearts. Perhaps these things are meant as a <lb/>
            trial of the existing generation to see how they are inclined <lb/>
            towards virtue, and whether they have been taught to bear <lb/>
            evils with resolute and firm minds, without yielding at the <lb/>
            first moment; all human considerations then are discarded, <lb/>
            and let them be discarded, but let an imperishable hope <lb/>
            and trust in God the Saviour remain in our souls, as he has <lb/>
            often preserved our nation amid inextricable difficulties and <lb/>
            distresses."</p>
          <p>XXX. These were the sort of things which we said, be­ <lb/>
            wailing at the same time our unexpected calamities, and yet <lb/>
            also encouraging one another with the hope of a change to <lb/>
            a more tranquil and peaceful state of things. And after a <lb/>
            little consideration and delay, we said to those who had <lb/>
            brought us this doleful news, " Why sit ye here quietly, <lb/>
            having just kindled sparks of eagerness in our ears by which <lb/>
            we are set on fire and rendered all in a blaze, when you <lb/>
            ought rather to add to what you have told us an account of <lb/>
            the causes which have operated on Caius."</p><pb n="144"/>
            
          <p>And they replied, " Youknowlthe principal and primary <lb/>
            cause of all; for that indeed is universally known to all men. <lb/>
            He desires to be considered a god; and he conceives that <lb/>
            the Jews alone are likely to be disobedient; and that there­ <lb/>
            fore he cannot possibly inflict a greater evil or injury upon <lb/>
            them than by defacing and insulting the holy dignity of <lb/>
            their temple; for report prevails that it is the most beau­ <lb/>
            tiful of all the temples in the world, inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            continually receiving fresh accessions of ornament and has <lb/>
            been for an infinite period of time, a never-ending and <lb/>
            boundless expense being lavished on it. And as he is a very <lb/>
            contentious and quarrelsome man, he thinks of appropriating <lb/>
            this edifice wholly to himself. And he is excited now on this <lb/>
            subject to a much greater degree than before by a letter <lb/>
            which Capito has sent to him.</p>
          <p>"Capito is the collector of the imperial revenues in <lb/>
            Judæa, and on some account or other he is very hostile to <lb/>
            the nations of the country; for having come thither a poor <lb/>
            man, and having amassed enormous riches of every imagin­ <lb/>
            able description by plunder and extortion, he has now <lb/>
            become afraid lest some accusation may be brought against <lb/>
            him, and on this account he has contrived a design by which <lb/>
            he may repel any such impeachment, namely, by calumni­ <lb/>
            ating those whom he has injured; and a circumstance which <lb/>
            we will now mention, has given him some pretext for car­ <lb/>
            rying out his design.</p>
          <p>" There is a city called Jamnia; one of the most populous <lb/>
            cities in all Judasa, which is inhabited by a promiscuous <lb/>
            multitude, the greatest number of whom are Jews ; but <lb/>
            there are also some persons of other tribes from the neigh­ <lb/>
            bouring nations who have settled there to their own <lb/>
            destruction, who are in a manner sojourners among the <lb/>
            original native citizens, and -who cause them a great deal of <lb/>
            trouble, and who do them a great deal of injury, as they are <lb/>
            continually violating some of the ancestral national customs <lb/>
            of the Jews. These men hearing from travellers who visit <lb/>
            the city how exceedingly eager and earnest Caius is about <lb/>
            is own deification, and how disposed he is to look unfavour­ <lb/>
            ably upon the whole race of Judæa, thinking that they have <lb/>
            now an admirable opportunity for attacking them them­ <lb/>
            selves, have erected an extemporaneous altar of the most <lb/>
             <pb n="145"/>
            contemptible materials, having made clay into bricks for the <lb/>
            sole purpose of plotting against their fellow citizens; for <lb/>
            they knew well that they would never endure to see their <lb/>
            customs transgressed ; as was indeed the case.</p>
          <p>" For when the Jews saw what they had done, and were <lb/>
            very indignant at the holiness and sanctity and beauty of <lb/>
            the sacred place being thus obscured and defaced, they col. <lb/>
            lected together and destroyed the altar; so the sojourners <lb/>
            immediately went to Capito who was in reality the contriver <lb/>
            of the whole affair ; and he, thinking that be had made a <lb/>
            most lucky hit, which he had been seeking for a long time, <lb/>
            writes to Caius dilating on the matter and exaggerating it <lb/>
            enormously; and he, when he had read the letter, ordered a <lb/>
            colossal statue gilt all over, much more costly and much <lb/>
            more magnificent than the rich altar which had been <lb/>
            erected in Jamnia, by way of insult to be set up in the <lb/>
            temple of the metropolis, having for his most excellent and <lb/>
            sagacious counsellors Helicon, that man of noble birth, a <lb/>
            chattering slave, a perfect scum of the earth, and a fellow of <lb/>
            the name of Apelles, a tragic actor, who when in the first <lb/>
            bloom of youth, as they say, made a market of his beauty, <lb/>
            and when he was past the freshness of youth went on the <lb/>
            stage; and in fact all those who go on the stage selling <lb/>
            themselves to the spectators, and to the theatres, are not <lb/>
            lovers of temperance and modesty, but rather of the most <lb/>
            extreme shamelessness and indecency.</p>
          <p>" On this account Apelles was taken into the rank of a <lb/>
            fellow counsellor of the emperor, that Caius might have an <lb/>
            adviser with whom he might indulge in mocking jests, and <lb/>
            with whom he might sing, passing over all considerations <lb/>
            of the general welfare of the state, as if everything in every <lb/>
            quarter of the globe was enjoying profound peace and tran­ <lb/>
            quillity under the laws.</p>
          <p>" Therefore Helicon, this scorpion-like slave, discharged all <lb/>
            his Egyptian venom against the Jews; and Apelles his <lb/>
            Ascalonite poison, for he was a native of Ascalon; and <lb/>
            between the people of Ascalon and the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            holy land, the Jews, there is an irreconcileable and never- <lb/>
            ending hostility although they are bordering nations."</p>
          <p>When we heard this we were wounded in our souls at <lb/>
            every word be said and at every name he mentioned; but <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            those admirable advisers of admirable actions a little while <lb/>
            afterwards met with the fit reward of their impiety, the one <lb/>
            being bound by Caius with iron chains for other causes, and <lb/>
            being put to the torture and to the rack after periods of <lb/>
            relief, as is the case with people affected with intermittent <lb/>
            diseases; and Helicon was put to death by Claudius Ger­ <lb/>
            manicus Cæsar, for other wicked actions, that, like a mad­ <lb/>
            man as he was, he had committed; but these occurrences <lb/>
            took place at a later date.</p>
          <p>XXXI. And the letter respecting the erection of the <lb/>
            statue was written not in plain terms, but with as much <lb/>
            caution and prudence as possible, taking every measure <lb/>
            which could tend to security; for he commands Petronius, <lb/>
            the lieutenant and governor of all Syria, to whom indeed he <lb/>
            wrote the letter, to lead half the army which was on the <lb/>
            Euphrates, to guard against any passage of that river by any <lb/>
            of the eastern kings or nations, into Judæa as an escort to <lb/>
            the statue ; not in order to honour its erection with any <lb/>
            especial pomp, but to chastise with death any attempt that <lb/>
            might be made to hinder it.</p>
          <p>What sayest thou, 0 master ? Are you making war upon <lb/>
            us, because you anticipate that we will not endure such <lb/>
            indignity, but that we will fight on behalf of our laws, and <lb/>
            die in defence of our national customs ? For you cannot <lb/>
            possibly have been ignorant of what was likely to result from <lb/>
            your attempt to introduce these innovations respecting our <lb/>
            temple; but having previously learnt with perfect accuracy <lb/>
            what was likely to happen as well as if it had already taken <lb/>
            place, and knowing the future as thoroughly as if it were <lb/>
            actually present, you commanded your general to bring <lb/>
            up an army in order that the statue when erected might be <lb/>
            consecrated by the first sacrifice offered to it, being of a <lb/>
            most polluted kind, stained with the blood of miserable men <lb/>
            and women.</p>
          <p>Accordingly Petronius, when he had read what he was <lb/>
            commanded to do in this letter, was in great perplexity, not <lb/>
            being able to resist the orders sent to him out of fear, for he <lb/>
            heard that the emperor's wrath was implacable not only <lb/>
            against those who did not do what they were commanded to <lb/>
            do, but who did not do it in a moment; and on the other <lb/>
            hand, he did not see how it was easy to perform them, for <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            he knew that the Jews would willingly, if it were possible, <lb/>
            endure ten thousand deaths instead of one, rather than <lb/>
            submit to see any forbidden thing perpetrated with respect <lb/>
            to their religion; for all men are eager to preserve their <lb/>
            own customs and laws, and the Jewish nation above all <lb/>
            others; for looking upon their laws as oracles directly given <lb/>
            to them by God himself, and having been instructed in this <lb/>
            doctrine from their very earliest infancy they bear in their <lb/>
            souls the images of the commandments contained in these <lb/>
            laws as sacred; and secondly, as they continually behold the <lb/>
            visible shapes and forms of them, they admire and venerate <lb/>
            them in their minds and they admit such foreigners as are <lb/>
            disposed to honour and worship them, to do so no less than <lb/>
            their own native fellow citizens.</p>
          <p>But all who attempt to violate their laws, or to turn them <lb/>
            into ridicule, they detest as their bitterest enemies, and <lb/>
            they look upon each separate one of the commandments <lb/>
            with such awe and reverence that, whether one ought to <lb/>
            call it the invariable good fortune or the happiness of the <lb/>
            nation, they have never been guilty of the violation of even <lb/>
            the most insignificant of them; but above all other obser­ <lb/>
            vances their zeal for their holy temple is the most predomi­ <lb/>
            nant, and vehement, and universal feeling throughout the <lb/>
            whole nation; and the greatest proof of this is that death is <lb/>
            inexorably pronounced against all those who enter into <lb/>
            the inner circuit of the sacred precincts (for they admit all <lb/>
            men from every country into the exterior circuit), unless he <lb/>
            be one of their own nation by blood.</p>
          <p>Petronius, having regard to these considerations, was very <lb/>
            reluctant to attempt what he was commanded to do, con­ <lb/>
            sidering what a great and wicked piece of daring he should <lb/>
            be committing, and invoking all the deliberative powers of <lb/>
            his soul as to a council, he inquired into the opinion of each <lb/>
            of them, and he found every faculty of his mind agreeing <lb/>
            that he should change nothing of these observances and <lb/>
            customs which had been hallowed from the beginning of the <lb/>
            world ; in the first place because of the natural principles of <lb/>
            justice and piety by which they were dictated, and secondly <lb/>
            because of the danger which threatened any attempt at <lb/>
            innovation upon them, not only from God, but also from the <lb/>
            people who would be insulted by such conduct. He also <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            gave a thought to the circumstances of the nation itself, to <lb/>
            its exceeding populousness, so that it was not contained as <lb/>
            every other nation was by the circuit of the one region <lb/>
            which was allotted to it for itself, but so that, I may almost <lb/>
            say, it had spread over the whole face of the earth ; for it is <lb/>
            diffused throughout every continent, and over every island, <lb/>
            so that everywhere it appears but little inferior in number <lb/>
            to the original native population of the country.</p>
          <p>Was it not, then, a most perilous undertaking to draw <lb/>
            upon himself such innumerable multitudes of enemies ? <lb/>
            And was there not danger of allies and friends from all <lb/>
            quarters arriving to their assistance ? It would be a result <lb/>
            of very formidable danger and difficulty, besides the fact <lb/>
            that the inhabitants of Judæa are infinite in numbers, and a <lb/>
            nation of great stature and personal strength, and of great <lb/>
            courage and spirit, and men who are willing to die in defence <lb/>
            of their national customs and laws with unshrinking bravery, <lb/>
            so that some of those who calumniate them say that their <lb/>
            courage (as indeed is perfectly true) is beyond that of any <lb/>
            barbarian nation, being the spirit of free and nobly born men.</p>
          <p>And the state of all the nations which lie beyond the <lb/>
            Euphrates added to his alarm; for he was aware that Baby­ <lb/>
            lon and many others of the satrapies of the east were occu­ <lb/>
            pied by the Jews, knowing this not merely by report but <lb/>
            likewise by personal experience ; for every year sacred mes­ <lb/>
            sengers are sent to convey large amounts of gold and silver <lb/>
            to the temple, which has been collected from all the subor­ <lb/>
            dinate governments, travelling over rugged, and difficult, and <lb/>
            almost impassable roads, which they look upon as level and <lb/>
            easy inasmuch as they serve to conduct them to piety.</p>
          <p>Therefore, being exceedingly alarmed, as was very natural, <lb/>
            lest if they heard of the unprecedented design of erecting <lb/>
            this colossal statue in the temple, they might on a sudden <lb/>
            direct their march that way and surround him, some on one <lb/>
            side and some on the other, so as to hem him in completely, <lb/>
            and co-operating with and joining one another might treat <lb/>
            the enemy who would be thus enclosed in the midst of them <lb/>
            with terrible severity, he hesitated long, attaching great <lb/>
            weight to all these considerations.</p>
          <p>Then again he was drawn in the opposite direction by <lb/>
            considerations of a contrary character, saying to himself, <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            " This is the command of one who is mv master and a young <lb/>
            man, and of one who judges everything which lie wishes to <lb/>
            have done to be expedient and becoming, and who is resolved <lb/>
            that everything which he has once decided on shall be at <lb/>
            once performed even though it may be the most injurious <lb/>
            measure possible and full of all contention and insolence; <lb/>
            and now having passed beyond all human nature he has <lb/>
            actually recorded himself to be God; and great danger of <lb/>
            my life impends over me whether I oppose him or whether <lb/>
            I comply with his commands; if I comply with them the <lb/>
            result will very probably be war, and one that perhaps may <lb/>
            be attended with doubtful success and which will be far from <lb/>
            turning out as it is expected to do; and if I oppose him I <lb/>
            shall then be exposed to the open and implacable hatred of <lb/>
            Caius."</p>
          <p>And with this opinion of his, many of those Romans who <lb/>
            were joined with him in the administration of the affairs of <lb/>
            Syria coincided, knowing that the anger of Caius and the <lb/>
            punishments which he would inflict would come upon them <lb/>
            first as being accomplices in the disobedience to the injunc­ <lb/>
            tions which he had sent; but at last when it arrived the <lb/>
            fashion of the statue afforded them a pretext for delay dur­ <lb/>
            ing which they might have time for a more deliberate con­ <lb/>
            sideration of the matter; for they did not send any man <lb/>
            from Rome (as it appears to me because the providence of <lb/>
            God overruled the matter in this way, who thus invisibly <lb/>
            stayed the hand of these wicked doers), nor did he command <lb/>
            the most skilful man or him who was accounted so in Syria. <lb/>
            to manage the matter, since while he was pressing on this <lb/>
            lawless action with all speed a war was suddenly kindled.</p>
          <p>Therefore having now opportunity to consider what course <lb/>
            would be most advantageous (for when great events sud­ <lb/>
            denly come altogether, they break down and perplex the <lb/>
            mind), he commanded the statue to be made in some one of <lb/>
            the bordering regions. Therefore Petronius, sending for the <lb/>
            most skilful and renowned artists in Phoenicia, gave them <lb/>
            the materials requisite for the making of the statue; and <lb/>
            they took them to Sidon, and there proceeded to make it.</p>
          <p>He also sent for the magistrates of the Jews and the <lb/>
            priests and rulers of the people, both to announce to them <lb/>
            the commands which he had received from Caius and also to <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            counsel them to submit cheerfully to the commands which <lb/>
            had been imposed by their master, and to give due considera­ <lb/>
            tion to the dangers before their eyes ; for that the most war­ <lb/>
            like ofthe military powers in Syria were all ready, and would <lb/>
            soon cover all the country with dead bodies; for he thought <lb/>
            that if he could previously weaken their resolution he would <lb/>
            be able by their means to work upon all the rest of the mul­ <lb/>
            titude and to persuade them not to oppose the will of the <lb/>
            emperor; but, as was natural, he was wholly disappointed in <lb/>
            his expectations; for it is said indeed that they were amazed <lb/>
            at his first words, and that at first they were utterly over­ <lb/>
            whelmed by his announcement of their real danger and <lb/>
            misery, and that they stood speechless and poured forth a <lb/>
            ceaseless abundance of tears as if from a fountain, tearing <lb/>
            their beards and the hair of their head, and saying, " We who <lb/>
            were formerly very fortunate, have now advanced through <lb/>
            many events to an exceeding old age that we might at last <lb/>
            behold what no one of our ancestors ever saw. With what <lb/>
            eyes can we endure to look upon these things ? Let them <lb/>
            rather be torn out, and let our miserable lives and our <lb/>
            afflicted existence be put an end to, before we behold such <lb/>
            an evil as this, such an intolerable spectacle which it is <lb/>
            impious to hear of or to conceive."</p>
          <p>XXXII. In this way did they bewail their fate; but <lb/>
            when the inhabitants of the holy city and of all the region <lb/>
            round about heard of the design which was in agitation, <lb/>
            they all arrayed themselves together as if at a concerted <lb/>
            signal, their common misery having given them the word, <lb/>
            and went forth in a body, and leaving their cities and their <lb/>
            villages and their houses empty, they hastened with one <lb/>
            accord into Phcenicia, for Petronius happened to be in that <lb/>
            country at the moment. And 'when some of the guards <lb/>
            of Petronius saw a countless multitude hastening towards <lb/>
            them they ran to their general to bring him the news, and <lb/>
            to warn him to take precautions, as they expected war; and <lb/>
            while they were relating to him what they had seen, he was <lb/>
            still without any guards ; and the multitude of the Jews <lb/>
            suddenly coming upon him like a cloud, occupied the whole <lb/>
            of Phcenicia, and caused great consternation among the <lb/>
            Phœnicians who thus beheld the enormous population of the <lb/>
            nation; and at first so great an outcry was raised, accom. <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            panied with weeping and beating of the breast, that the very <lb/>
            ears of those present could not endure the vastness of the <lb/>
            noise; for it did not cease when they ceased, but continued <lb/>
            to vibrate even after they were quiet: then there were <lb/>
            approaches to the governor, and supplications addressed to <lb/>
            him such as the occasion suggested; for calamities are <lb/>
            themselves teachers of what should be done in an existing <lb/>
            emergency.</p>
          <p>And the multitude was divided into six companies, one of <lb/>
            old men, one of young men, one of boys; and again in their <lb/>
            turn one band of aged matrons, one of women in the prime <lb/>
            of life, and one of virgins ; and when Petronius appeared at <lb/>
            a distance all the ranks, as they had been appointed, fell to <lb/>
            the ground, uttering a most doleful howling and lamenta­ <lb/>
            tion, mingled with supplications. But when he commanded <lb/>
            them to rise up, and to come nearer to him, they would for <lb/>
            a long time hardly consent to rise, and scattering abundance <lb/>
            of dust upon their heads, and shedding abundance of tears, <lb/>
            they put both their hands behind them like captives who are <lb/>
            fettered in this way, and thus they approached him.</p>
          <p>Then the body of the old men, standing before him, <lb/>
            addressed him in the following terms : " We are, as you see, <lb/>
            without any arms, but yet as we passed along some persons <lb/>
            have accused us as being enemies, but even the very weapons <lb/>
            of defence with which nature has provided each individual, <lb/>
            namely our hands, we have averted from you, and placed in <lb/>
            a position where they can do nothing, offering our bodies <lb/>
            freely an easy aim to any one who desires to put us to <lb/>
            death. We have brought unto you our wives, and our <lb/>
            children, and our whole families, and in your person we will <lb/>
            prostrate ourselves before Caius, having left not one single <lb/>
            person at home, that you may either preserve us all, or <lb/>
            destroy us all together by one general and complete destruc­ <lb/>
            tion. Petronius, we are a peaceful nation, both by our <lb/>
            natural disposition and by our determined intentions, and <lb/>
            the education which has been industriously and carefully <lb/>
            instilled into us has taught us this lesson from our very <lb/>
            earliest infancy. When Caius assumed the imperial power <lb/>
            we were the first people in all Syria to congratulate him, <lb/>
            Vitellius at that time being in our city, from whom you <lb/>
            received the government as his successor, to whom writings <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            concerning these matters were sent, and the happy news <lb/>
            proceeding onwards from our city, where it had been re­ <lb/>
            ceived with joy, reached the other cities with similar accept­ <lb/>
            ance. Ours was the first temple which received sacrifices <lb/>
            for the happy reign of Caius. Did it do so that it might be <lb/>
            the first or the only temple to be deprived of its customary <lb/>
            modes of worship ?</p>
          <p>" We have now left our cities, we have abandoned our <lb/>
            houses and our possessions, we will cheerfully contribute to <lb/>
            you all our furniture, all our cattle, and all our treasures, <lb/>
            everything in short which belongs to us, as a willing booty. <lb/>
            We shall think that we are receiving them, not giving them <lb/>
            up. We only ask one thing instead of and to counterbalance <lb/>
            all of them, namely, that no innovations may take place in <lb/>
            respect of our temple, but that it may be kept such as we <lb/>
            have received it from our fathers and our forefathers. And <lb/>
            if we cannot prevail with you in this, then we offer up our­ <lb/>
            selves for destruction, that we may not live to behold a <lb/>
            calamity more terrible and grievous than death. We hear <lb/>
            that great forces of infantry and cavalry are being prepared <lb/>
            by you against us, if we oppose the erection and dedication <lb/>
            of this statue. No one is so mad as, when he is a slave, to <lb/>
            oppose his master. We willingly and readily submit our­ <lb/>
            selves to be put to death; let your troops slay us, let them <lb/>
            sacrifice us, let them cut us to pieces unresisting and uncon­ <lb/>
            tending, let them treat us with every species of cruelty that <lb/>
            conquerers can possibly practise, but what need is there of <lb/>
            any army ? We ourselves, admirable priests for the purpose, <lb/>
            will begin the sacrifice, bringing to the temple our wives <lb/>
            and slaying our wives, bringing our brothers and sisters and <lb/>
            becoming fratricides, bringing our sons and our daughters, <lb/>
            that innocent and guiltless age, and becoming infanticides. <lb/>
            Those who endure tragic calamities must needs make use of <lb/>
            tragic language. Then standing in the middle of our victims, <lb/>
            having bathed ourselves deeply in the blood of our kinsfolk <lb/>
            (for such blood will be the only bath which we shall have <lb/>
            wherewith to cleanse ourselves for the journey to the shades <lb/>
            below), we will mingle our own blood with it, slaughtering <lb/>
            ourselves upon their bodies. And when we are dead, let <lb/>
            this commandment be inscribed over us as an epitaph, ' Let <lb/>
            not even God blame us, who have had a due regard to both <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            considerations, pious loyalty towards the emperor and the <lb/>
            reverential preservation of our established holy laws.'</p>
          <p>" And this will be what will be deservedly said of us if we <lb/>
            give up our miserable life, holding it in proper contempt. <lb/>
            We have heard of a most ancient tradition, which has been <lb/>
            handed down throughout Greece by their historians, who <lb/>
            have affirmed that the head of the Gorgon had such mighty <lb/>
            power, that those who beheld it immediately became stones <lb/>
            and rocks. But this appears only to be a fiction and fable, <lb/>
            the truth being that great, and unexpected, and wonderful <lb/>
            events do often bring after them great disaster ; for instance, <lb/>
            the anger of a master causes death, or calamities equivalent <lb/>
            to death.</p>
          <p>" Do you suppose (may God forbid that any such event <lb/>
            should ever take place) that if any of our countrymen were <lb/>
            to see this statue being brought into our temple, it would <lb/>
            not change them into stones ? Their limbs being all con­ <lb/>
            gealed, and their eyes becoming fixed so as not to be capable <lb/>
            of motion, and their whole body losing all its natural motions <lb/>
            in every one of its united parts arid limbs ! We will, how­ <lb/>
            ever, now, 0 Petronius, address to you one last and most <lb/>
            righteous and just request; we say that you ought not to do <lb/>
            what you are commanded, but we entreat you to grant us a <lb/>
            respite, and we most earnestly supplicate you to delay a <lb/>
            little while till we appoint an embassy, and send it to <lb/>
            approach your master, and to convey our entreaties to him. <lb/>
            Perhaps in our embassy we may find some argument or <lb/>
            other to persuade him, either by bringing before him all the <lb/>
            considerations respecting the honour of God, or the preser­ <lb/>
            vation of our indestructible and unalterable laws, or by <lb/>
            urging upon him that we ought not to be subjected to a <lb/>
            worse fate than all the nations even in the very most remote <lb/>
            extremities of the earth, who have been allowed to preserve <lb/>
            their national customs; with reference to which his grand­ <lb/>
            father and great-grandfather came to a righteous decision <lb/>
            when they confirmed and set the seal to our customs with <lb/>
            all care. Perhaps when he hears these arguments he will <lb/>
            be more merciful to us. The intentions of the great do not <lb/>
            always continue the same, and those which are adopted in <lb/>
            anger are the quickest to change. We have been grievously <lb/>
            calumniated. Suffer us to refute the false accusations which <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            have been brought against us. It is hard to be condemned <lb/>
            without being heard in our own defence.</p>
          <p>" And if we fail to convince him, what will after that pre­ <lb/>
            vent him from doing the things which he at present intends <lb/>
            to do ? Until, then, we have sent this embassy, do not cut <lb/>
            off all the hopes of so many myriads of men, since our zeal <lb/>
            and earnestness is displayed not in the cause of gain, but in <lb/>
            that of religion; though indeed we speak foolishly in using <lb/>
            such an expression as that, for what can be a more real and <lb/>
            beneficial gain to men than holiness ?"</p>
          <p>XXXIII. They uttered these complaints and entreaties <lb/>
            with great agony and misery of soul, with exceeding sobbing <lb/>
            and difficulty of speech, for all their limbs sweated with <lb/>
            apprehension, and their ceaseless tears flowed in torrents, so <lb/>
            that all who heard them, and Petronius himself, sympathised <lb/>
            with their sorrow, for he was by nature a man very kind <lb/>
            and gentle in his natural disposition, so that he was easily <lb/>
            influenced by what was now said or heard; and what was <lb/>
            said appeared to be entirely just, and the misery of those whom <lb/>
            he now beheld appeared most pitiable; and rising up, and <lb/>
            retiring with his fellow counsellors, he took counsel as to <lb/>
            what he ought to do, and he saw that those who a short <lb/>
            time before opposed the wishes of the Jews with all their <lb/>
            might were now wavering and perplexed, and that those who <lb/>
            had previously been hesitating were now for the most part <lb/>
            inclined to compassion, at which he was pleased.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, though he was well acquainted with the <lb/>
            disposition of the emperor, and how implacable and inexor­ <lb/>
            able he was in his anger, he still had himself some sparks of <lb/>
            the Jewish philosophy and piety, since he had long ago learnt <lb/>
            something of it by reason of his eagerness for learning, and <lb/>
            had studied it still more ever since he had come as governor <lb/>
            of the countries in which there are vast numbers of Jews <lb/>
            scattered over every city of Asia and Syria; or partly because <lb/>
            he was so disposed in his mind from his spontaneous, and <lb/>
            natural, and innate inclination for all things which are <lb/>
            worthy of care and study.</p>
          <p>Moreover, God himself appears often to suggest virtuous <lb/>
            ideas to virtuous men, by which, while benefiting others, <lb/>
            they will likewise be benefited themselves, which now was <lb/>
            the case with Petronius. What then was his resolution ? <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            Not to hurry on the artists, but to persuade them to <lb/>
            continue to finish the statue which they had in hand, <lb/>
            taking pains and labouring as far as might be possible not <lb/>
            to be inferior to the most renowned models, but to take <lb/>
            plenty of time, so as to make their work perfect, since <lb/>
            things which are done in a hurry are very often inferior, <lb/>
            but things which are done with great pains and skill require <lb/>
            a length of time. But the embassy which they entreated <lb/>
            leave to send he determined not to permit, for he considered <lb/>
            that it would not be safe for him to allow it; still he deter­ <lb/>
            mined not to oppose those who wished to refer the whole <lb/>
            matter to the supreme sovereign and master, but neither to <lb/>
            agree with nor to contradict the multitude, for he considered <lb/>
            that either line of conduct was fraught with danger.</p>
          <p>Moreover, he determined to write a letter to Caius, not in <lb/>
            any respect accusing the Jews, and on the other hand not <lb/>
            giving any accurate account of their entreaties and suppli­ <lb/>
            cations, and to explain the delay which was taking place in <lb/>
            the erection of the statue, partly because the preparation of <lb/>
            it required a certain space of time for its completion, and <lb/>
            partly, he reminded him, that the season of the year was in <lb/>
            some degree the cause of unavoidable delay, in which there <lb/>
            was no question but that Caius must of necessity acquiesce, <lb/>
            for it was just at the moment the very height of the wheat <lb/>
            harvest and of all the other cereal crops; and he said that <lb/>
            he was afraid lest out of despair of the preservation of their <lb/>
            national and hereditary laws and customs, the men might <lb/>
            conceive such a contempt for life as either themselves to lay <lb/>
            waste their lands, or to burn all the corn-bearing district, <lb/>
            whether mountainous or champaign country, and, therefore, <lb/>
            that he might require a guard to secure a careful gathering in <lb/>
            of the crops, and that not only of such as were borne on the <lb/>
            arable land but of those produced by fruit-bearing trees ; for <lb/>
            he himself was intending, as is said, to sail to Alexandria in <lb/>
            Egypt, but so great a general did not choose to cross the open <lb/>
            sea both by reason of the danger and also of the numerous <lb/>
            fleet which would be required as his escort, and also from <lb/>
            his regard for his own person, as everything requisite for his <lb/>
            comfort would be more easily provided if he took the circui­ <lb/>
            tous route through Asia and Syria; for he would, if he <lb/>
            coasted along, be able to sail every day and land every night, <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            especially if he took with him a sufficient number of ships <lb/>
            of war, and not transports, in which a coasting voyage is <lb/>
            more successful, just as one across the open sea is better for <lb/>
            merchantmen. Therefore it was necessary that abundant <lb/>
            quantities of forage and food should be prepared for his <lb/>
            cattle in every one of the Syrian cities, and especially in all <lb/>
            such as were on the coast, for a numerous multitude would <lb/>
            be proceeding both by land and sea, collected not only from <lb/>
            Rome itself and from Italy, but that which had also followed <lb/>
            him from all the other provinces of the empire as far as <lb/>
            Syria, being partly the regular guard of the magistrates, and <lb/>
            partly the regular army of infantry and cavalry, and the <lb/>
            naval force, and also a troop of servants but little inferior in <lb/>
            number to the army. Moreover, there was need not only of <lb/>
            such an abundance of supplies as might be sufficient for all <lb/>
            necessary purposes, but also for all the superfluous prodi­ <lb/>
            gality of which Caius was fond. If he reads these writings <lb/>
            perhaps he will not only not be angry, but will be even <lb/>
            pleased with our prudential caution, as having caused this <lb/>
            delay not from any regard for the Jews, but for the sake of <lb/>
            providing for the collection of the harvest.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. And when his assessors had delivered their <lb/>
            opinions, he commanded letters to be written, and appointed <lb/>
            active men, who were accustomed to make rapid journeys, to <lb/>
            convey them. And they, when they had arrived at their <lb/>
            journey's end, delivered the letters; but the emperor, before <lb/>
            he had finished reading them, became swollen with anger, <lb/>
            and went on making marks at every page, in fury and <lb/>
            indignation; and when he had come to the end of the letter, <lb/>
            he clapped his hands together, saying, " Of a truth, Pe­ <lb/>
            tronius, you seem but little to comprehend that you are <lb/>
            the subject of the emperor; the uninterrupted series of <lb/>
            governments to which you have been preferred have filled <lb/>
            you with guile. Up to the present time it seems to me that <lb/>
            you have no notion of acknowledging that you know, even <lb/>
            by hearsay, that Caius is emperor, but you shall very <lb/>
            speedily find it out by your own experience, for you are <lb/>
            careful about the laws of the Jews, a nation which I hate <lb/>
            above every other, and you are indifferent about the imperial <lb/>
            commands of your sovereign. You fear the multitude. <lb/>
            Had you not with you then the military forces which all the <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            eastern nations, and the chief of them all, the Parthians, <lb/>
            fear ? But you pitied them, you paid more attention to <lb/>
            feelings of compassion than to the express commands of <lb/>
            Caius.</p>
          <p>" Make your pretext of the harvest, but you yourself shall <lb/>
            soon find that you have brought on your own head a punish­ <lb/>
            ment which cannot be averted by any pretexts or excuses. <lb/>
            Blame the necessity for collecting the crops, and for making <lb/>
            adequate provision for my armies, for even if a complete <lb/>
            scarcity were to oppress Judæa, still are there not vast <lb/>
            regions on its borders of great fertility and productiveness, <lb/>
            sufficient aDd able to supply all necessary food, and to make <lb/>
            up for the deficiency of one district ? But why do I speak <lb/>
            in this way before acting ? And why is there no one who <lb/>
            anticipates my intentions ? He who delays shall first find <lb/>
            out that he is receiving the wages of his delay by suffering in <lb/>
            his own person. I will say no more, but I shall not forget <lb/>
            the matter."</p>
          <p>And after a brief interval, he dictated to one of his <lb/>
            secretaries an answer to Petronius, praising him in appear­ <lb/>
            ance for his prudence, and for his careful and accurate <lb/>
            consideration of the future, for he was very careful with <lb/>
            respect to the governors of the provinces, seeing that they <lb/>
            had at all times great facilities for making innovations or <lb/>
            revolutions, especially if they happened to be in districts of <lb/>
            importance, and in command of powerful armies such as was <lb/>
            on the Euphrates for the protection of Syria. Therefore, <lb/>
            being very civil to him in words and in his letters, he con­ <lb/>
            cealed his anger till a favourable opportunity, though he was <lb/>
            very much exasperated; but at the end of the letter, after <lb/>
            having mentioned every other subject, he desired him not to <lb/>
            be so anxious about anything as about the speedy erection <lb/>
            and dedication of the statue, for that by this time the harvest <lb/>
            must have been able to be got in, whether the excuse was <lb/>
            originally an honest and true or only a plausible one.</p>
          <p>XXXV. However a short time afterwards King Agrippa <lb/>
            arrived in Rome, according to custom, to pay his respects to <lb/>
            Caius, and he knew absolutely nothing either of what <lb/>
            Petronius had written in his letter, or of what Caius had <lb/>
            written in his first or second epistle, but by his irregular <lb/>
            motions and agitations, and by the excitement which shone <lb/>

            in his eyes, lie conjectured that he had some anger smoulder­ <lb/>
            ing beneath, and he considered, and pondered, and turned <lb/>
            over every matter in every direction, racking his brain for <lb/>
            every reason, whether great or small, to see whether he had <lb/>
            said or done anything unbecoming, and when he felt sure <lb/>
            that he had done absolutely nothing, he conjectured, as was <lb/>
            natural, that it was some one else with whom he was <lb/>
            offended. But again, when he saw that he looked morosely <lb/>
            at him, and that he kept his eyes continually fixed on him, <lb/>
            and on no one else who was ever present, he began to be <lb/>
            alarmed, and though he often thought of putting the <lb/>
            question to him, he restrained himself, reflecting in this <lb/>
            manner: " Perhaps by doing so I may draw down on myself <lb/>
            the threats which as it is are destined for others, by bring­ <lb/>
            ing upon myself a suspicion of being a busybody, and a rash <lb/>
            and audacious man."</p>
          <p>Therefore, when Caius saw that he was in a state of great <lb/>
            alarm and perplexity, for he was very acute at comprehend­ <lb/>
            ing a man's inmost designs and feelings from his outward <lb/>
            appearance and expression of countenance, he said, " You <lb/>
            arc embarrassed, 0 Agrippa. I will relieve you from your <lb/>
            perplexity. Though you have lived with me for such a <lb/>
            length of time, are you yet ignorant that I speak not only <lb/>
            with my voice, but also with my eyes, intimating everything, <lb/>
            to say the least of it, as much in one way as in the other ? <lb/>
            Your loyal and excellent fellow citizens, the only nation of <lb/>
            men upon the whole face of the earth by whom Caius is not <lb/>
            esteemed to be a god, appear now to be even desiring to <lb/>
            fplot my death in their obstinate disobedience, for when I <lb/>
            commanded my statue in the character of Jupiter to be <lb/>
            erected in their temple, they raised the whole of their <lb/>
            people, and quitted the city and the whole country in a <lb/>
            (body, under pretence of addressing a petition to me, but in <lb/>
            reality being determined to act in a manner contrary to the <lb/>
            commands which I had imposed upon them."</p>
          <p>And when he was about to add other charges against <lb/>
            them Agrippa fell into such a state of grief that he changed <lb/>
            into all sorts of colours, becoming at the same moment <lb/>
            bloodshot, and pale, and livid, for he was all over agitation <lb/>
            and trembling from the top of his head down to his feet, <lb/>
            and a quivering and shaking seized upon and disordered all <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            nis limbs and every member of his body, all his sinews, and <lb/>
            muscles, and nerves being relaxed and enfeebled, so that lie <lb/>
            fainted away, and would have fallen down if some of the <lb/>
            bystanders had not supported him.</p>
          <p>And they being commanded to carry him home, bore him <lb/>
            to his palace, where he lay for some time in a state of torpor <lb/>
            without any one understanding what sudden misfortune <lb/>
            had brought him into this state. Therefore Caius was <lb/>
            exasperated still more against our nation, and cherished a <lb/>
            more furious anger against us than before, " For," said he, <lb/>
            " if Agrippa, who is my most intimate and dearest friend, <lb/>
            and one bound to me by so many benefits, is so completely <lb/>
            under the influence of his national customs that he cannot <lb/>
            bear even to hear a word against them, but faints away to <lb/>
            such a degree as to be near dying, what must one expect <lb/>
            will be the feelings of others who have no motive or influence <lb/>
            to draw them the other way ?"</p>
          <p>Agrippa, then, during all that day and the greater portion <lb/>
            of the next day, lay in a state of profound stupor, being <lb/>
            completely unconscious of everything that passed; but <lb/>
            about evening he raised his head a little, and for a short <lb/>
            time opened, though with difficulty, his languid eyes, and <lb/>
            with dim and indistinct vision looked upon the people who <lb/>
            surrounded him, though he was not as yet able to distinguish <lb/>
            clearly between their several forms and features; and then <lb/>
            again relapsing into sleep, he became tranquil, getting into <lb/>
            a better condition than at first, as those about him could <lb/>
            conjecture from his breathing and from the state of his <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>And afterwards, when he awoke again, and rose up, he <lb/>
            asked, " Where now am I ? Am I with Caius ? Is my <lb/>
            lord himself here ?" And they replied, " Be of good cheer; <lb/>
            you are by yourself in your own palace. Cams is not <lb/>
            here. You have now had a sufficient tranquil sleep, but <lb/>
            now turn and raise yourself, and rest upon your elbow, and <lb/>
            recognise those who are about you; they are all your own <lb/>
            people, those of your friends, and freedmen, and domestics, <lb/>
            who honour you above all others, and who are honoured by <lb/>
            you in return." And he, for he was now beginning to <lb/>
            recover from his state of stupefaction, saw feelings of <lb/>
            sympathy in every one's face, and when his physicians <lb/>
             <pb n="160"/>
            ordered most of them to leave the room, that they might <lb/>
            refresh his body with anointing and seasonable food, " Go," <lb/>
            said he, " for you must by all means take care that I may <lb/>
            have a more carefully regulated way of life, for it is not <lb/>
            sufficient for me, unfortunate man that I am, to ward off <lb/>
            hunger by a bare, and scanty, and economical, and precise <lb/>
            use of necessary food; nor should I have attended to any <lb/>
            such matters if it had not been my object to provide my <lb/>
            miserable nation with the last resource which my mind <lb/>
            suggests to me by way of assisting it." Accordingly, he, <lb/>
            shedding abundance of tears, and eating just what was <lb/>
            necessary without any sauce or seasoning, and drinking no <lb/>
            mixed wine but only tasting water, soon left off eating. <lb/>
            " My miserable stomach," said he, " recoils from the things <lb/>
            which it demanded ; and now what ought I to do but address <lb/>
            myself to Caius with respect to existing circumstances ?"</p>
          <p>XXXVI. And having taken tablets, he writes to him in <lb/>
            the following manner: "0 master, fear and shame have <lb/>
            taken from me all courage to come into your presence to <lb/>
            address you; since fear teaches me to dread your threats; <lb/>
            and shame, out of respect for the greatness of your power <lb/>
            and dignity, keeps me silent. But a writing will show my <lb/>
            request, which I now here offer to you as my earnest <lb/>
            petition. In all men, 0 emperor! a love of their country is <lb/>
            innate, and an eager for dness for their national customs and <lb/>
            laws. And concerning these matters there is no need that <lb/>
            I should give you information, since you have a heart-felt <lb/>
            love of your own country, and a deeply-seated respect for <lb/>
            your national customs. And what belongs to themselves <lb/>
            appears beautiful to every one, even if it is not so in reality; <lb/>
            for they judge of these things not more by reason than by <lb/>
            the feelings of affection. And I am, as you know, a Jew; <lb/>
            and Jerusalem is my country, in which there is erected the <lb/>
            holy temple of -the most high God. And I have kings for <lb/>
            my grandfathers and for my ancestors, the greater part of <lb/>
            whom have been called high priests, looking upon their royal <lb/>
            power as inferior to their office as priests ; and thinking that <lb/>
            the high priesthood is as much superior to the power of a <lb/>
            king, as God is superior to man ; for that the one is occupied <lb/>
            in rendering service to God, and the other has only the care <lb/>
            of governing them. Accordingly I, being one of this nation, <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            and being attached to this country and to such a temple, <lb/>
            address to you this petition on behalf of them all; on <lb/>
            behalf of the nation, that it may not be looked upon by you <lb/>
            in a light contrary to the true one; since it is a most pious <lb/>
            and holy nation, and one from the beginning most loyally <lb/>
            disposed to your family.</p>
          <p>" For in all the particulars in which men are enjoined by <lb/>
            the laws, and in which they have it in their power to show <lb/>
            their piety and loyalty, my nation is inferior to none what­ <lb/>
            ever in Asia or in Europe, whether it be in respect of <lb/>
            prayers, or of the supply of sacred offerings, or in the <lb/>
            abundance of its sacrifices, not merely of such as are offered <lb/>
            on occasions of the public festivals, but in those which are <lb/>
            continually offered day after day; by which means they <lb/>
            show their loyalty and fidelity more surely than by their <lb/>
            mouth and tongue, proving it by the designs of their honest <lb/>
            hearts, not indeed saying that they are friends to Cæsar, but <lb/>
            being so in reality.</p>
          <p>"Concerning the holy city I must now say what is necessary. <lb/>
            It, as I have already stated, is my native country, and the <lb/>
            metropolis, not only of the one country of Judaea, but also <lb/>
            of many, by reason of the colonies which it has sent out from <lb/>
            time to time into the bordering districts of Egypt, Phoenicia, <lb/>
            Syria in general, and especially that part of it which is called <lb/>
            Coelo-Syria, and also with those more distant regions of <lb/>
            Pamphylia, Cilicia, the greater part of Asia Minor as far as <lb/>
            Bithynia, and the furthermost corners of Pontus. And in <lb/>
            the same manner into Europe, into Thessaly, and Bceotia, <lb/>
            and Macedonia, and vEtolia, and Attica, and Argos, and <lb/>
            Corinth and all the most fertile and wealthiest districts of <lb/>
            Peloponnesus. And not only are the continents full of <lb/>
            Jewish colonies, but also all the most celebrated islands are <lb/>
            so too; such as Euboea, and Cyprus, and Crete.</p>
          <p>" I say nothing of the countries beyond the Euphrates, for <lb/>
            all of them except a very small portion, and Babylon, and <lb/>
            all the satrapics around, which have any advantages whatever <lb/>
            of soil or climate, have Jews settled in them. So that if my <lb/>
            native land is, as it reasonably may be, looked upon as <lb/>
            entitled to a share in your favour, it is not one city only <lb/>
            that would then be benefited by you, but ten thousand of <lb/>
            them in every region of the habitable world, in Europe, in <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            Asia, and in Africa, on the continent, in the islands, on the <lb/>
            coasts, and in the inland parts. And it corresponds well <lb/>
            to the greatness of your good fortune, that, by conferring <lb/>
            benefits on one city, you should also benefit ten thousand <lb/>
            others, so that your renown may be celebrated in every part <lb/>
            of the habitable world, and many praises of you may be <lb/>
            combined with thanksgiving.</p>
          <p>" You have thought the native countries of some of your <lb/>
            friends worthy of being admitted to share all the privileges <lb/>
            of the Roman constitution; and those who but a little while <lb/>
            ago were slaves, became the masters of others who also <lb/>
            enjoyed your favour in a higher, or at all events not in a <lb/>
            lower degree, and they were delighted too at the causes of <lb/>
            your beneficence. And I indeed am perfectly aware that I <lb/>
            belong to the class which is in subjection to a lord and <lb/>
            master, and also that I am admitted to the honour of being <lb/>
            one of your companions, being inferior to you in respect of <lb/>
            my birthright and natural rank, and inferior to no one <lb/>
            whomsoever, not to say the most eminent of all men, in good <lb/>
            will and loyalty towards you, both because that is my <lb/>
            natural disposition, and also in consequence of the number <lb/>
            of benefits with which you have enriched me ; so that if I in <lb/>
            consequence had felt confidence to implore you myself on <lb/>
            behalf of ray country, if not to grant to it the Roman con­ <lb/>
            stitution, at least to confer freedom and a remission of taxes <lb/>
            on it, I should not have thought that I had any reason to <lb/>
            fear your displeasure for preferring such a petition to you, <lb/>
            and for requesting that most desirable of all things, your <lb/>
            favour, which it can do you no harm to grant, and which is <lb/>
            the most advantageous of all things for my country to <lb/>
            receive.</p>
          <p>" For what can possibly be a more desirable blessing for a <lb/>
            subject nation than the good will of its sovereign ? It was <lb/>
            at Jerusalem, 0 emperor! that your most desirable succes­ <lb/>
            sion to the empire was first announced; and the news of <lb/>
            your advancement spread from the holy city all over the <lb/>
            continent on each side, and was received with great gladness. <lb/>
            And on this account that city deserves to meet with favour <lb/>
            at your hands; for, as in families the eldest children receive <lb/>
            the highest honours as their birthright, because they were <lb/>
            the first to give the name of father and mother to their <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            parents, so, in like manner, since this is first of all the cities <lb/>
            in the east to salute you as emperor, it ought to receive <lb/>
            greater benefit from you than any other; or if not greater, <lb/>
            at all events as great as any other city.</p>
          <p>"Having now advanced these pleas on the ground of justice, <lb/>
            and made these petitions on behalf of my native country, I <lb/>
            now come at last to my supplication on behalf of the temple. <lb/>
            0 my lord and master, Caius! this temple has never, from <lb/>
            the time of its original foundation until now, admitted any <lb/>
            form made by hands, because it has been the abode of God. <lb/>
            Now, pictures and images are only imitations of those gods <lb/>
            who are perceptible to the outward senses; but it was not <lb/>
            considered by our ancestors to be consistent with the <lb/>
            reverence due to God to make any image or representation <lb/>
            of the invisible God. Agrippa, when he came to the temple, <lb/>
            did honour to it, and he was thy grandfather; and so did <lb/>
            Augustus, when by his letters he commanded all first fruits <lb/>
            from all quarters to be sent thither; and by the continual <lb/>
            sacrifice. And thy great grandmother ......</p>
          <p>" On which account, no one, whether Greek or barbarian, <lb/>
            satrap, or king, or implacable enemy; no sedition, no war, <lb/>
            no capture, no destruction, no occurrence that has ever <lb/>
            taken place, has ever threatened this temple with such <lb/>
            innovation as to place in it any image, or statue, or any <lb/>
            work of any kind made with bands; for, though enemies <lb/>
            have displayed their hostility to the inhabitants of the <lb/>
            country, still, either reverence or fear has possessed them <lb/>
            sufficiently to prevent them from abrogating any of the laws <lb/>
            which were established at the beginning, as tending to the <lb/>
            honour of the Creator and Father of the universe; for they <lb/>
            knew that it is these and similar actions which bring after <lb/>
            them the irremediable calamities of heaven-sent afflic­ <lb/>
            tions. On which account they have been careful not to <lb/>
            sow an impious seed, fearing lest they should be compelled <lb/>
            to reap its natural harvest, in a fruit bearing utter <lb/>
            destruction.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. " But why need I invoke the assistance of <lb/>
            foreign witnesses when I have plenty with whom I can <lb/>
            furnish you from among your own countrymen and friends ? <lb/>
            Marcus Agrippa, your own grandfather on the mother's <lb/>
            side, the moment that he arrived in Judæa, when llerod, <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            my grandfather, was king of the country, thought fit to go <lb/>
            up from the seacoast to the metropolis, which was inland. <lb/>
            And when he had beheld the temple, and the decorations of <lb/>
            the priests, and the piety and holiness of the people of the <lb/>
            country, he marvelled, looking upon the whole matter as <lb/>
            one of great solemnity and entitled to great respect, and <lb/>
            thinking that he had beheld what was too magnificent to be <lb/>
            described. And he could talk of nothing else to his com­ <lb/>
            panions but the magnificence of the temple and every thing <lb/>
            connected with it.</p>
          <p>" Therefore, every day that he remained in the city, by <lb/>
            reason of his friendship for Herod, he went to that sacred <lb/>
            place, being delighted with the spectacle of the building, <lb/>
            and of the sacrifices, and all the ceremonies connected with <lb/>
            the worship of G-od, and the regularity which was observed, <lb/>
            and the dignity and honour paid to the high priest, and his <lb/>
            grandeur when arrayed in his sacred vestments and when <lb/>
            about to begin the sacrifices. And after he had adorned <lb/>
            the temple with all the offerings in his power to contribute, <lb/>
            and had conferred many benefits on the inhabitants, doing <lb/>
            them many important services, and having said to Herod <lb/>
            many friendly things, and having been replied to in <lb/>
            corresponding terms, he was conducted back again to the <lb/>
            sea coast, and to the harbour, and that not by one city only <lb/>
            but by the whole country, having branches strewed in his <lb/>
            road, and being greatly admired and respected for his <lb/>
            piety.</p>
          <p>" What again did your other grandfather, Tiberius Cæsar, <lb/>
            do ? does not he appear to have adopted an exactly similar <lb/>
            line of conduct? At all events, during the three and <lb/>
            twenty years that he was emperor, he preserved the form of <lb/>
            worship in the temple as it had been handed down from the <lb/>
            earliest times, without abrogating or altering the slightest <lb/>
            particular of it.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. " Moreover, I have it in my power to relate <lb/>
            one act of ambition on his part, though I suffered an <lb/>
            infinite number of evils when he was alive; but nevertheless <lb/>
            the truth is considered dear, and much to be honoured by <lb/>
            you. Pilate was one of the emperor's lieutenants, having <lb/>
            been appointed governor of Judæa. He, not more with the <lb/>
            odject of doing honour to Tiberius than with that of vexing <lb/>
             <pb n="165"/>
            the multitude; dedicated some gilt shields in the palace of <lb/>
            Herod, in the holy city; which had no form nor any other <lb/>
            forbidden thing represented on them except some necessary <lb/>
            inscription, which mentioned these two facts, the name of <lb/>
            the person who had placed them there, and the person in <lb/>
            whose honour they were so placed there. But when the <lb/>
            multitude heard what had been done, and when the circum­ <lb/>
            stance became notorious, then the people, putting forward <lb/>
            the four sons of the king, who were in no respect inferior to <lb/>
            the kings themselves, in fortune or in rank, and his other <lb/>
            descendants, and those magistrates who were among them <lb/>
            at the time, entreated him to alter and to rectify the inno­ <lb/>
            vation which he had committed in respect of the shields; <lb/>
            and not to make any alteration in their national customs, <lb/>
            which had hitherto been preserved without any interruption, <lb/>
            without being in the least degree changed by any king or <lb/>
            emperor.</p>
          <p>" But when he steadfastly refused this petition (for he was <lb/>
            a man of a very inflexible disposition, and very merciless as <lb/>
            well as very obstinate), they cried out: 'Do not cause a <lb/>
            sedition; do not make war upon us; do not destroy the <lb/>
            peace which exists. The honour of the emperor is not <lb/>
            identical with dishonour to the ancient laws; let it not be <lb/>
            to you a pretence for heaping insult on our nation. Tibe­ <lb/>
            rius is not desirous that any of our laws or customs shall be <lb/>
            destroyed. And if you yourself say that he is, show us <lb/>
            either some command from him, or some letter, or some­ <lb/>
            thing of the kind, that we, who have been sent to you as <lb/>
            ambassadors, may cease to trouble you, and may address our <lb/>
            supplications to your master.'</p>
          <p>" But this last sentence exasperated him in the greatest <lb/>
            possible degree, as he feared lest they might in reality go on <lb/>
            an embassy to the emperor, and might impeach him with <lb/>
            respect to other particulars of his government, in respect of <lb/>
            his corruption, and his acts of insolence, and his rapine, and <lb/>
            his habit of insulting people, and his cruelty, and his <lb/>
            continual murders of people untried and uncondemned, and <lb/>
            his never ending, and gratuitous, and most grievous in­ <lb/>
            humanity. Therefore, being exceedingly angry, and being <lb/>
            at all times a man of most ferocious passions, he was in <lb/>
            great perplexity, neither venturing to take down what he. <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            bad once set up, nor wishing to do any thing which could <lb/>
            be acceptable to his subjects, and at the same time being <lb/>
            sufficiently acquainted with the firmness of Tiberius on these <lb/>
            points. And those who were in power in our nation, seeing <lb/>
            this, and perceiving that he was inclined to change his mind <lb/>
            as to what he had done, but that he was not willing to be <lb/>
            thought to do so, wrote a most supplicatory letter to <lb/>
            Tiberius. And he, when he had read it, what did he say of <lb/>
            Pilate, and what threats did he utter against him! But it <lb/>
            is beside our purpose at present to relate to you how very <lb/>
            angry he was, although he was not very liable to sudden <lb/>
            anger; since the facts speak for themselves; for immedi­ <lb/>
            ately, without putting any thing off till the next day, he <lb/>
            wrote a letter, reproaching and reviling him in the most <lb/>
            bitter manner for his act of unprecedented audacity and <lb/>
            wickedness, and commanding him immediately to take down <lb/>
            the shields and to convey them away from the metropolis of <lb/>
            Judæa to Cæsarea, on the sea which had been named <lb/>
            Csesarea Augusta, after his grandfather, in order that they <lb/>
            might be set up in the temple of Augustus. And accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, they were set up in that edifice. And in this way he <lb/>
            provided for two matters: both for the honour due to the <lb/>
            emperor, and for the preservation of the ancient customs of <lb/>
            the city.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. " Now the things set up on that occasion were <lb/>
            shields, on which there was no representation of any living <lb/>
            thing whatever engraved. But now the thing proposed to <lb/>
            be erected is a colossal statue. Moreover, then the erection <lb/>
            was in the dwelling-house of the governor; but they say, <lb/>
            that which is now contemplated is to be in the inmost part <lb/>
            of the temple, in the very holy of holies itself, into which, <lb/>
            once in the year, the high priest enters, on the day called <lb/>
            the great fast, to offer incense, and on no other day, being <lb/>
            then about in accordance with our national law also to offer <lb/>
            up prayers for a fertile and ample supply of blessings, and <lb/>
            for peace to all mankind. And if any one else, I will not <lb/>
            say of the Jews, but even of the priests, and those not of the <lb/>
            lowest order, but even those who are in the rank next to the <lb/>
            first, should go in there, either with him or after him, or <lb/>
            even if the very high priest himself should enter in thither <lb/>
            on two days in the year, or three or four times on the same <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            day, he is subjected to inevitable death for his impiety, so <lb/>
            great are the precautions taken by our lawgiver with respect <lb/>
            to the holy of holies, as he determined to preserve it alone <lb/>
            inaccessible to and untouched by any human being.</p>
          <p>" How many deaths then do you not suppose that the <lb/>
            people, who have been taught to regard this place with such <lb/>
            holy reverence, would willingly endure rather than see a <lb/>
            statue introduced into it ? I verily believe that they would <lb/>
            rather slay all their whole families, with their wives and <lb/>
            children, and themselves last of all, in the ruins of their <lb/>
            houses and families, and Tiberius knew this well. And what <lb/>
            did your great-grandfather, the most excellent of all em­ <lb/>
            perors that ever lived upon the earth, he who was the first to <lb/>
            have the appellation of Augustus given him, on account of <lb/>
            his virtue and good fortune; he who diffused peace in every <lb/>
            direction over earth and sea, to the very furthest extremities <lb/>
            of the world ? Did not he, when he had heard a report of <lb/>
            the peculiar characteristics of our temple, and that there is <lb/>
            in it no image or representation made by hands, no visible <lb/>
            likeness of Him who is invisible, no attempt at any imita­ <lb/>
            tion of his nature, did not he, I say, marvel at and honour <lb/>
            it ? for as he was imbued with something more than a mere <lb/>
            smattering of philosophy, inasmuch as he had deeply feasted <lb/>
            on it, and continued to feast on it every day, he partly retraced <lb/>
            in his recollection all the precepts of philosophy which his <lb/>
            mind had previously learnt, and partly also he kept his <lb/>
            learning alive by the conversation of the literary men who <lb/>
            were always about him; for at his banquets and entertain­ <lb/>
            ments, the greatest part of the time was devoted to learned <lb/>
            conversation, in order that not only his friends' bodies but <lb/>
            their minds also might be nourished.</p>
          <p>XL. " And though I might be able to establish this fact, <lb/>
            and demonstrate to you the feelings of Augustus, your great <lb/>
            grandfather, by an abundance of proofs, I will be content with <lb/>
            two; for, in the first place, he sent commandments to all <lb/>
            the governors of the different provinces throughout Asia, <lb/>
            because he heard that the sacred first fruits were neglected, <lb/>
            enjoining them to permit the Jews alone to assemble <lb/>
            together in the synagogues, for that these assemblies were <lb/>
            not revels, which from drunkenness and intoxication pro­ <lb/>
            ceeded to violence, so as to disturb the peaceful condition of <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            the country, but were rather schools of temperance and jus­ <lb/>
            tice, as the men who met in them were studiers of virtue, <lb/>
            and contributed the first fruits every year, sending com­ <lb/>
            missioners to convey the holy things to the temple in <lb/>
            Jerusalem.</p>
          <p>" And, in the next place, he commanded that no one should <lb/>
            hinder the Jews, either on their way to the synagogues, or <lb/>
            when bringing their contributions, or when proceeding in <lb/>
            obedience to their national laws to Jerusalem, for these <lb/>
            things were expressly enjoined, if not in so many words, <lb/>
            at all events in effect; and I subjoin one letter, in order to <lb/>
            bring conviction to you who are our master, what Caius <lb/>
            Norbanus Flaccus wrote, in which he details what had been <lb/>
            written to him by Csesar, and the superscription of the <lb/>
            letter is as follows :—</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">CAIUS jTOBBATTUS FLACCUS, PROCONSUL, TO THE GOVERNORS OF THE EPHESIANS, GREETING.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>" ' Cæsar has written word to me, that the Jews, wherever <lb/>
            they are, are accustomed to assemble together, in compli­ <lb/>
            ance with a peculiar ancient custom of their nation, to con­ <lb/>
            tribute money which they send to Jerusalem; and he does <lb/>
            not choose that they should have any hindrance offered to <lb/>
            them, to prevent them from doing this; therefore I have <lb/>
            written to you, that you may know that I command that <lb/>
            they shall be allowed to do these things.'</p>
          <p>" Is not this a most convincing proof, 0 emperor, of the <lb/>
            intention of Cæsar respecting the honours paid to our tem­ <lb/>
            ple which he had adopted, not considering it right that <lb/>
            because of some general rule, with respect to meetings, the <lb/>
            assemblies of the Jews, in one place should be put down, <lb/>
            which they held for the sake of offering the first fruits, and <lb/>
            for other pious objects ?</p>
          <p>" There is also another piece of evidence, in no respect <lb/>
            inferior to this one, and which is the most undeniable proof <lb/>
            of the will of Augustus, for he commanded perfect sacrifices <lb/>
            of whole burnt offerings to be offered up to the most high <lb/>
            God every day, out of his own revenues, which are per­ <lb/>
            formed up to the present time, and the victims are two <lb/>
            sheep and a bull, with which Cæsar honoured the altar of <lb/>
            God, well knowing that there is in the temple no image <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            erected, either in open sight or in any secret part of it. But <lb/>
            that great ruler, who was inferior to no one in philosophy, <lb/>
            considered within himself, that it is necessary in terrestrial <lb/>
            things, that an especial holy place should be set apart for <lb/>
            the invisible God, who will not permit any visible represent­ <lb/>
            ation of himself to be made, by which to arrive at a partici­ <lb/>
            pation in favourable hopes and the enjoyment of perfect <lb/>
            blessings.</p>
          <p>" And your grandmother, Julia Augusta, following the <lb/>
            example of so great a guide in the paths of piety, did also <lb/>
            adorn the temple with some golden vials and censers, and <lb/>
            with a great number of other offerings, of the most costly <lb/>
            and magnificent description; and what was her object in <lb/>
            doing this, when there is no statue erected within the tem­ <lb/>
            ple ? for the minds of women are, in some degree, weaker <lb/>
            than those of men, and are not so well able to comprehend <lb/>
            a thing which is appreciable only by the intellect, without <lb/>
            any aid of objects addressed to the outward senses; but she, <lb/>
            as she surpassed all her sex in other particulars, so also was <lb/>
            she superior to them in this, by reason of the pure learning <lb/>
            and wisdom which had been implanted in her, both by <lb/>
            nature and by study; so that, having a masculine intellect, <lb/>
            she was so sharpsighted and profound, that she compre­ <lb/>
            hended what is appreciable only by the intellect, even more <lb/>
            than those things which are perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, and looked upon the latter as only shadows of the <lb/>
            former.</p>
          <p>XLI. " Therefore, 0 master, having all these examples <lb/>
            most nearly connected with yourself and your family, of our <lb/>
            purposes and customs, derived from those from whom you <lb/>
            are sprung, of whom you are born, and by whom you have <lb/>
            been brought up, I implore you to preserve those principles <lb/>
            which each of those persons whom I have mentioned did <lb/>
            preserve; they who were themselves possessed of imperial <lb/>
            power do, by their laws, exhort you, the emperor; they who <lb/>
            were august, speak to you who are also Augustus; your <lb/>
            grandfathers and ancestors speak to their descendant; num­ <lb/>
            bers of authorities address one individual, all but saying, in <lb/>
            express words: Do not you destroy those things in our <lb/>
            councils which remain, and which have been preserved as <lb/>
            permanent laws to this very day; for even if no mischief <lb/>
             <pb n="170"/>
            were to ensue from the abrogation of them, still, at all <lb/>
            events, the result would be a feeling of uncertainty respect­ <lb/>
            ing the future, and such uncertainty is full of fear, even to <lb/>
            the most sanguine and confident, if they are not despisers <lb/>
            of divine things.</p>
          <p>" If I were to enumerate the benefits which I myself have <lb/>
            received at your hands, the day would be too short for me•, <lb/>
            besides the fact that it is not proper for one who has under- <lb/>
            taken to speak on one subject to branch off to a digression <lb/>
            about some other matter. And even if I should be silent, <lb/>
            the facts themselves speak and utter a distinct voice. You <lb/>
            released me when I was bound in chains and iron. Who is <lb/>
            there who is ignorant of this ? But do not, after having <lb/>
            done so, 0 emperor! bind me in bonds of still greater <lb/>
            bitterness: for the chains from which you released me <lb/>
            surrounded a part of my body, but those which I am now <lb/>
            anticipating are the chains of the soul, which are likely to <lb/>
            oppress it wholly and in every part; you abated from me a <lb/>
            fear of death, continually suspended over my head; you <lb/>
            received me when I was almost dead through fear; you <lb/>
            raised me up as it were from the dead. Continue your <lb/>
            favour, 0 master, that your Agrippa may not be driven <lb/>
            wholly to forsake life ; for I shall appear (if you do not do so) <lb/>
            to have been released from bondage, not for the purpose of <lb/>
            being saved, but for that of being made to perish in a more <lb/>
            conspicuous manner.</p>
          <p>i " You have given me the greatest and most glorious in- <lb/>
            I heritance among mankind, the rank and power of a king, at <lb/>
            first over one district, then over another and a more import­ <lb/>
            ant one, adding to my kingdom the district called Trachonitis <lb/>
            and Galilee. Do not then, 0 master! after having loaded <lb/>
            me with means of superfluity, deprive me of what is actually <lb/>
            necessary. Do not, after you have raised me up to the most <lb/>
            brilliant light, cast me down again from my eminence to the <lb/>
            most profound darkness. I am willing to descend from <lb/>
            this splendid position in which you have placed me; I do <lb/>
            not deprecate a return to the condition in which I was a <lb/>
            short time ago ; I will give up everything; I look upon <lb/>
            everything as of less importance than the one point of pre­ <lb/>
            serving the ancient customs and laws of my nation unaltered; <lb/>
            for if they are violated, what could I say, either to my <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            fellow countrymen or to any other men ? It would follow <lb/>
            of necessity that I must be looked upon as one of two <lb/>
            things, either as a betrayer of my people, or as one who is <lb/>
            no longer accounted a friend by you. And what could be a <lb/>
            greater misery than either of these two things P For if I <lb/>
            am still reckoned among the company of your friends, I shall <lb/>
            then receive the imputation of treason against my own <lb/>
            nation, if neither my country is preserved free from all mis­ <lb/>
            fortune, nor even the temple left inviolate. For you, great <lb/>
            men, preserve the property of your companions and of those <lb/>
            who take refuge in your protection by your imperial splen­ <lb/>
            dour and magnificence. And if you have any secret grief or <lb/>
            vexation in your mind, do not throw me into prison, like <lb/>
            Tiberius, but deliver me from any anticipation of being <lb/>
            thrown into prison at any future time; command me at <lb/>
            once to be put out of the way. For what advantage would <lb/>
            it be to me to live, who place my whole hopes of safety and <lb/>
            happiness in your friendship and favour ?"</p>
          <p>XLII. Having written this letter and sealed it, he sent it <lb/>
            to Caius, and then shutting himself up he remained in his <lb/>
            own house, full of agony, confusion, and disorder, and <lb/>
            anxiety, as to what was the best way of approaching and ad­ <lb/>
            dressing the emperor ; for he and his people had incurred no <lb/>
            slight danger, but they had reason to apprehend expulsion <lb/>
            from their country, and slavery, and utter destruction, as <lb/>
            impending not only over those who were dwelling in the <lb/>
            holy land, but over all the Jews in every part of the world.</p>
          <p>But the emperor, having taken the letter and read it, and <lb/>
            having considered every suggestion which was contained in <lb/>
            it, was very angry, because his intentions had not been exe­ <lb/>
            cuted: and yet, at the same time, he was moved. by the <lb/>
            appeals to his justice and by the supplications which were <lb/>
            thus addressed to him, and in some respects he was pleased <lb/>
            with Agrippa, and in some he blamed him. He blamed him" <lb/>
            for his excessive desire to please his fellow countrymen, who <lb/>
            were the only men who had resisted his orders and shown <lb/>
            any unwillingness to submit to his deification; but he <lb/>
            praised him for concealing and disguising none of his feel­ <lb/>
            ings, which conduct he said was a proof of a liberal and <lb/>
            noble disposition. Therefore being somewhat appeased, at <lb/>
            least as far as appearance went, he condescended to return <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            a somewhat favourable answer, granting to Agrippa that <lb/>
            highest and greatest of all favours, the consent that this <lb/>
            erection of his statue should not take place; and he corn­ <lb/>
            manded letters to be written to Publius Petronius the <lb/>
            governor of Syria, enjoining him not to allow any alterations <lb/>
            or innovations to be made with respect to the temple of the <lb/>
            Jews. Nevertheless, though he did grant him the favour, <lb/>
            he did not grant it without any alloy, but he mingled with it <lb/>
            a grievous terror; for he added to the letter,­</p>
          <p>" If any people in the bordering countries, with the ex­ <lb/>
            ception of the metropolis itself, wishing to erect altars or <lb/>
            temples, nay, images or statues, in honour of me and of my <lb/>
            family are hindered from doing so, I charge you at once to <lb/>
            punish those who attempt to hinder them, or else to bring <lb/>
            them before the tribunal." Now this was nothing else but a <lb/>
            beginning of seditions and civil wars, and an indirect way of <lb/>
            annulling the gift which he appeared to be granting. For <lb/>
            some men, more out of a desire of mortifying the Jews than <lb/>
            from any feelings of loyalty towards Caius, were inclined to <lb/>
            fill the whole country with erections of one kind or another. <lb/>
            But they who beheld the violation of their national customs <lb/>
            practised before their eyes were resolved above all things <lb/>
            not to endure such an injury unresistingly. But Caius, <lb/>
            judging those who were thus excited to disobedience to be <lb/>
            worthy of the most severe punishment possible, a second <lb/>
            time orders his statue to be erected in the temple. But by <lb/>
            the providence and care of God, who beholds all things and <lb/>
            governs all things in accordance with justice, not one of the <lb/>
            neighbouring nations made any movement at all; so that <lb/>
            there was no occasion for these commands being carried into <lb/>
            effect, and these inexorably appointed calamities all termi­ <lb/>
            nated in only a moderate degree of blame.</p>
          <p>What advantage, then, was gained ? some one will say; <lb/>
            for even when they were quiet, Caius was not quiet; but he <lb/>
            had already repented of the favour which he had showed <lb/>
            to Agrippa, and had re-kindled the desires which he had <lb/>
            entertained a little while before ; for he commanded another <lb/>
            statue to be made, of colossal size, of brass gilt over, in Rome, <lb/>
            no longer moving the one which had been made in Sidon, in <lb/>
            order that the people might not be excited by its being <lb/>
            moved, but that while they remained in a state of tranquillity <lb/>
             <pb n="173"/>
            and felt released from their suspicions, it might in a period <lb/>
            of peace be suddenly brought to the country in a ship, and <lb/>
            be suddenly erected without the multitude being aware of <lb/>
            what was going on.</p>
          <p>XLIII. And he was intending to do this while on his <lb/>
            voyage along the coast during the period which he had <lb/>
            allotted for his sojourn in Egypt. For an indescribable de­ <lb/>
            sire occupied his mind to see Alexandria, to which he was <lb/>
            eager to go with all imaginable haste, and when he had <lb/>
            arrived there he intended to remain a considerable time, <lb/>
            urging that the deification about which he was so anxious, <lb/>
            might easily be originated and carried to a great height <lb/>
            in that city above all others, and then that it would <lb/>
            be a model to all other cities of the adoration to which he <lb/>
            was entitled, inasmuch as it was the greatest of all the cities <lb/>
            of the east, and built in the finest situation in the world. <lb/>
            For all inferior men and nations are eager to imitate great <lb/>
            men and great states.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Caius was in other respects a man in whose <lb/>
            nature there was nothing stable or trustworthy so that, <lb/>
            even if he did anything good or kind, he speedily repented <lb/>
            of it, and in such a manner that he soon attempted to annul <lb/>
            what he had done in such a way as to cause even greater <lb/>
            affliction and injury to those whom he had favoured. For <lb/>
            instance, he released some prisoners, and then for no reason <lb/>
            whatever he threw them into prison a second time, inflicting <lb/>
            upon them a second calamity more grievous than the first, <lb/>
            namely, that which was caused by unexpected misfortune. <lb/>
            Again, he condemned some persons to banishment who had <lb/>
            expected sentence of death; not because they were con­ <lb/>
            scious of having committed crimes deserving of death, or <lb/>
            indeed of any punishment at all, even the lightest, but <lb/>
            because of the extravagant inhumanity of their master they J <lb/>
            did not expect to escape. Now to these men, banishment <lb/>
            was a downright gain, and equivalent almost to a restoration, <lb/>
            since they looked upon it that they had escaped the greatest <lb/>
            of all evils, the danger of death. But no long period elapsed <lb/>
            brfore he sent some soldiers after them, though no new <lb/>
            circumstances had arisen, and put to death simultaneously <lb/>
            the most excellent and nobly-born of the exiles who were <lb/>
            living in the different islands as their own countries, and' <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            who were bearing their misfortunes in the most contented <lb/>
            manner, inflicting in this way the greatest and most pitiable <lb/>
            and unexpected misery on many of the noblest families in <lb/>
            Rome.</p>
          <p>And if he ever gave any one a sum of money as a gift, he <lb/>
            demanded it back again at some future time, not a simple <lb/>
            loan but he also required interest and compound interest, <lb/>
            and often treating the persons themselves who had <lb/>
            received it from him as thieves, and punishing them with <lb/>
            the severest penalties for having stolen it; for he was not <lb/>
            contented that those miserable men should return what had <lb/>
            been given to them, but he compelled them also to give up <lb/>
            all their property which they had inherited from their <lb/>
            parents, or relations, or from any friends, or which, having <lb/>
            selected a life of industry and profit, they had acquired by <lb/>
            their own resources.</p>
          <p>And those who appeared to be in the greatest credit <lb/>
            with him, and who lived with him in a round of pleasure, as <lb/>
            one may say, with great appearances of friendship and good <lb/>
            will, were greatly injured by him, being compelled to expend <lb/>
            large sums in irregular, and illegal, and sudden journeys, <lb/>
            and in entertainments; for they lavished whole properties <lb/>
            in the preparation of a single banquet, so that they were <lb/>
            compelled to have recourse to usurers, so vast was his pro­ <lb/>
            digality ; therefore many men deprecated the receiving of <lb/>
            any favours from him, thinking not only that it was of no <lb/>
            advantage, but even that they were only a bait and a snare <lb/>
            to lead them into intolerable suffering.</p>
          <p>So great therefore was his inequality of temper towards <lb/>
            every one, and most especially towards the nation of the <lb/>
            Jews to which he was most bitterly hostile, and accordingly <lb/>
            beginning in Alexandria he took from them all their syna­ <lb/>
            gogues there, and in the other cities, and filled them all <lb/>
            with images and statues of his own form; for not caring <lb/>
            about any other erection of any kind, he set up his own <lb/>
            statue every where by main force; and the great temple <lb/>
            in the holy city, which was left untouched to the last, having <lb/>
            been thought worthy of all possible respect and preservation, <lb/>
            he altered and transformed into a temple of his own, that he <lb/>
            might call it the temple of the new Jupiter, the illustrious <lb/>
            Caius.</p><pb n="175"/>
            
          <p>What is this that you say ? Do you, who are a man, <lb/>
            seek to take to yourself the air and the heaven, not being <lb/>
            content with the vast multitude of continents, and islands, <lb/>
            and nations, and countries of which you enjoy the sove­ <lb/>
            reignty ? And do you not think any one of the gods who <lb/>
            are worshipped in that city or by our people worthy of any <lb/>
            country or city or even of any small precinct which may <lb/>
            have been consecrated to them in old time, and dedicated to <lb/>
            them with oracles and sacred hymns, and are you intending <lb/>
            to deprive them of that, that in all the vast circumference of <lb/>
            the world there may be no visible trace or memorial to be <lb/>
            found of any honour or pious worship paid to the true real <lb/>
            living God ? Truly you are suggesting fine hopes to the <lb/>
            race of mankind; are you ignorant that you are opening the <lb/>
            fountains of evils of every kind, making innovations, and <lb/>
            committing acts of audacious impiety such as it is wicked to <lb/>
            do and even to think of ?</p>
          <p>XLIV. It is worth while to make mention of what we <lb/>
            both saw and heard, when we were sent for to encounter a <lb/>
            contest on behalf of our national constitution; for the mo­ <lb/>
            ment that we entered into the presence of the emperor we <lb/>
            perceived, from his looks and from the state of agitation in <lb/>
            which he was, that we had come not before a judge but <lb/>
            before an accuser, or rather I should say before the open <lb/>
            enemy of those whom he looked upon as opposed to his will ; <lb/>
            for it would have been the part of a judge to sit with <lb/>
            assessors selected because of their virtue and learning, when <lb/>
            a question of the greatest importance was being investigated <lb/>
            which had lain dormant for four hundred years, and which <lb/>
            was now raised for the first time among many myriads of <lb/>
            Alexandrian Jews; and it would have been proper for the <lb/>
            contending parties with their advocates to stand on each <lb/>
            side of him, and for him to listen to them both in turn; first <lb/>
            to the accusation and then in turn to the defence, according <lb/>
            to a period measured by water,* and then retiring the <lb/>
            judge should deliberate with his assessors as to what he <lb/>
            ought publicly to deliver as his sentence on the justice of <lb/>
            the case; but what was actually done resembled rather the <note type="footnote"> * The time allotted to the speeches of advocates in the Athenian <lb/>
            courts of justice was measured by a water-clock, <foreign xml:lang="grc">κλεψύδρα</foreign>, something <lb/>
            like our hour-glass of sand. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            conduct of an implacable tyrant, exhibiting uncontrolled <lb/>
            authority and displeasure and pride.</p>
          <p>For besides that he in no particular behaved in the man­ <lb/>
            ner which I have just been describing as proper, having <lb/>
            sent for the managers of two gardens, the Mæcenatian and <lb/>
            the Lamian garden, and they are near one another and close <lb/>
            to the city, in which he had spent three or four days, for <lb/>
            that was the place in which this theatrical spectacle, aimed <lb/>
            at the happiness of a whole nation, was intended to be <lb/>
            enacted in our presence, he commanded all the outer build­ <lb/>
            ings to be opened for him, for that he wished to examine <lb/>
            them all. minutely; but we, as soon as we were introduced <lb/>
            into his presence, the moment that we saw him, bent to the <lb/>
            ground with all imaginable respect and adoration, and saluted <lb/>
            him calling him the emperor Augustus; and he replied to us <lb/>
            in such a gentle and courteous and humane manner that we <lb/>
            not only despaired of attaining our object, but even of pre­ <lb/>
            serving our lives; for, said he, " You are haters of God, <lb/>
            inasmuch as you do not think that I am a god, I who am <lb/>
            already confessed to be a god by every other nation, but <lb/>
            who am refused that appellation by you." And then, <lb/>
            stretching up his hands to heaven, he uttered an ejacula­ <lb/>
            tion which it was impious to hear, much more would it be <lb/>
            so to repeat it literally.</p>
          <p>And immediately all the ambassadors of the opposite <lb/>
            portion were filled with all imaginable joy, thinking that <lb/>
            their embassy was already successful, on account of the first <lb/>
            words uttered by Caius, and so they clapped their hands and <lb/>
            danced for joy, and called him by every title which is appli­ <lb/>
            cable to any one of the gods.</p>
          <p>XLV. And while he was triumphing in these super­ <lb/>
            human appellations, the sycophant Isidorus, seeing the <lb/>
            temper in which he was, said, " 0 master, you will hate with <lb/>
            still juster vehemence these men whom you see before you <lb/>
            and their fellow countrymen, if you are made acquainted with <lb/>
            I their disaffection and disloyalty towards yourself; for when <lb/>
            all other men were offering up sacrifices of thanksgiving for <lb/>
            your safety, these men alone refused to offer any sacrifice at <lb/>
            all; and when I say, ' these men,' I comprehend all the <lb/>
            rest of the Jews." And when we all cried out with one <lb/>
            accord, " 0 Lord Caius, we are falsely accused; for we did <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            sacrifice, and we offered up entire hecatombs, the blood of <lb/>
            which we poured in a libation upon the altar, and the flesh <lb/>
            we did not carry to our homes to make a feast and banquet <lb/>
            upon it, as it is the custom of some people to do, but we <lb/>
            committed the victims entire to the sacred flame as a burnt <lb/>
            offering: and we have done this three times already, and <lb/>
            not once only; on the first occasion when you succeeded to <lb/>
            the empire, and the second time when you recovered from <lb/>
            that terrible disease with which all the habitable world was <lb/>
            afflicted at the same time, and the third time we sacrificed <lb/>
            in hope of your victory over the Germans."</p>
          <p>"Grant," said be, "that all this is true, and that you <lb/>
            did sacrifice; nevertheless you sacrificed to another god, <lb/>
            and not for my sake; and then what good did you do me ? <lb/>
            Moreover you did not sacrifice to me." Immediately a pro­ <lb/>
            found shuddering came upon us the first moment that we <lb/>
            heard this expression, similar to that which overwhelmed us <lb/>
            when we first came into his presence. And while he was <lb/>
            saying this he entered into the outer buildings, examining <lb/>
            the chambers of the men and the chambers of the women, <lb/>
            and the rooms on the ground floor, and all the apartments <lb/>
            in the upper story, and blaming some points of their prepa­ <lb/>
            ration as defective, and planning alterations and suggesting <lb/>
            designs, and giving orders himself to make them more costly <lb/>
            and then we being driven about in this way followed him <lb/>
            up and down through the whole place, being mocked and <lb/>
            ridiculed by our adversaries like people at a play in the <lb/>
            theatre; for indeed the whole matter was a kind of farce: the <lb/>
            judge assumed the part of an accuser, and the accusers the <lb/>
            part of an unjust judge, who look upon the defendants with <lb/>
            an eye of hostility, and act in accordance with the nature of <lb/>
            truth. And when a judge invested with such mighty power <lb/>
            begins to reproach the person who is on his trial before him <lb/>
            it is necessary to be silent; for it is possible even to defend <lb/>
            one's self in silence, and especially for people who are able to <lb/>
            make no reply on any of the subjects which he was now <lb/>
            investigating and desiring to understand, inasmuch as our <lb/>
            laws and our customs restrained our tongues, and shut and <lb/>
            sewed up our mouths.</p>
          <p>But when he had given some of his orders about the <note type="footnote"> TOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            buildings, he then asked a very important and solemn ques­ <lb/>
            tion; "why is it that you abstain from eating pig's flesh?" <lb/>
            And then again at this question such a violent laughter was <lb/>
            raised by our adversaries, partly because they were really <lb/>
            delighted, and partly as they wished to court the emperor <lb/>
            out of flattery, and therefore wished to make it appear that <lb/>
            this question was dictated by wit and uttered with grace, <lb/>
            that some of the servants who were following him were <lb/>
            indignant at their appearing to treat the emperor with so <lb/>
            little respect, since it was not safe for his most intimate <lb/>
            ffriends to do so much as smile at his words. And when we <lb/>
            made answer that, " different nations have different laws, and <lb/>
            there are some things of which the use is forbidden both to <lb/>
            us and to our adversaries;" and when some one said, " there <lb/>
            are also many people who do not eat lamb's flesh which is <lb/>
            the most tender of all meat," he laughed and said, " they <lb/>
            are quite right, for it is not nice." Being joked with and <lb/>
            trifled with and ridiculed in this manner, we were in great <lb/>
            perplexity ; and at last he said in a rapid and peremptory <lb/>
            manner, " I desire to know what principles of justice you <lb/>
            recognise with regard to your constitution."</p>
          <p>And when we began to reply to him and to explain it, he, <lb/>
            as soon as he had a taste of our pleading on the principles <lb/>
            of justice, and as soon as he perceived that our arguments <lb/>
            were not contemptible, before we could bring forward the <lb/>
            more important things which we had to say, cut us short <lb/>
            and ran forward and burst into the principal building, and <lb/>
            as soon as he had entered he commanded the windows <lb/>
            which were around it to be filled up with the transparent <lb/>
            pebbles very much resembling white crystal which do not <lb/>
            hinder the light, but which keep out the wind and the heat <lb/>
            of the sun. Then proceeding on deliberately he asked <lb/>
            in a more moderate tone, " What are you saying?" And <lb/>
            when we began to connect our reply with what we had <lb/>
            said before, lie again ran on and went into another house, <lb/>
            in which he had commanded some ancient and admirable <lb/>
            pictures to be placed.</p>
          <p>But when our pleadings on behalf of justice were thus <lb/>
            broken up, and cut short, and interrupted, and crushed as <lb/>
            one may almost say, we, being wearied and exhausted, and <lb/>
            having no strength left in us, but being in continual expect­ <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            ation of nothing else than death, could no longer keep our <lb/>
            hearts as they had been, but in our agony we took refuge in <lb/>
            supplications to the one true God, praying him to check <lb/>
            the wrath of this falsely called god. And he took compas­ <lb/>
            sion on us, and turned his mind to pity. And he becoming <lb/>
            pacified merely said, " These men do not appear to me to be <lb/>
            wicked so much as unfortunate and foolish, in not believing <lb/>
            that I have been endowed with the nature of God;" and so <lb/>
            he dismissed us, and commanded us to depart.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Having then escaped from what was rather a <lb/>
            theatre and a prison than a court of justice (for as in a <lb/>
            theatre, there was a great noise of people hissing, and <lb/>
            groaning, and ridiculing us in an extravagant manner, and <lb/>
            as in a prison, there were many blows inflicted on our <lb/>
            bodies, and tortures, and things to agitate our whole souls <lb/>
            by the blasphemies which those around us uttered against <lb/>
            the Deity, and the threats which they breathed forth against <lb/>
            ourselves, and which the emperor himself poured forth with <lb/>
            such vehemence, being indignant with us not in behalf of <lb/>
            any one else, for in that case he would soon have been <lb/>
            appeased, but because of himself and his great desire to beJ <lb/>
            declared a god, in which desire he considered that the Jews <lb/>
            were the only people who did not acquiesce, and who were <lb/>
            unable to subscribe to it), we at last recovered our breath, not <lb/>
            because we had been afraid of death from a base hankering <lb/>
            after life, since we would have cheerfully embraced death as <lb/>
            immortality if our laws and customs could have been <lb/>
            established by such means, but because we knew that we <lb/>
            should be destroyed with great ignominy, without any <lb/>
            desirable object being secured by such means, for whatever <lb/>
            insults ambassadors are subjected to are at all times referred <lb/>
            to those who sent them.</p>
          <p>It was owing to these considerations that we were able to <lb/>
            hold up our heads for a while, but there were other circum­ <lb/>
            stances which terrified us, and kept us in great perplexity <lb/>
            and distress to hear what the emperor would decide, and <lb/>
            what he would pronounce, and what kind of sentence he <lb/>
            would ultimately deliver; for he heard the general tenor of <lb/>
            our arguments, though he disdained to attend to some of our <lb/>
            facts. But would it not be a terrible thing for the-interests <lb/>
            of all the Jews throughout the whole world to be thrown <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            into confusion by the treatment to which we, its five embas­ <lb/>
            sadors, were exposed ? For if he were to give us up to our <lb/>
            enemies, what other city could enjoy tranquillity ? What <lb/>
            city would there be in which the citizens would not attack <lb/>
            the Jews living in it? What synagogue would be left <lb/>
            uninjured ? What state would not overturn every principle <lb/>
            of justice in respect of those of their countrymen who <lb/>
            arrayed themselves in opposition to the national laws and <lb/>
            customs of the Jews ? They will be overthrown, they will <lb/>
            be shipwrecked, they will be sent to the bottom, with all the <lb/>
            particular laws of the nation, and those too which are <lb/>
            common to all and in accordance with the principles of <lb/>
            justice recognized in every city.</p>
          <p>We, then, being overwhelmed with affliction, in our <lb/>
            misery perplexed ourselves with such reasonings as these; <lb/>
            for even those who up to this time had seemed to co-operate <lb/>
            with us were now wearied of taking our part. Therefore, <lb/>
            when we called them forth, they being within, did not <lb/>
            remain, but came forth privily in fear, knowing well the <lb/>
            desire which the emperor had to be looked upon as God.</p>
          <p>We have now related in a concise and summary manner <lb/>
            the cause of the hatred of Cams to the whole nation of the <lb/>
            Jews; we must now proceed to make our palinode to Caius.</p>

          <p>I. THERE is no existing thing equal in honour to God, <lb/>
            but he is the one Ruler, and Governor, and King, to whom <lb/>
            alone it is lawful to govern and regulate everything; for the <lb/>
            verse— <lb/>
            " A multitude of masters is not good, <lb/>
            Let there one sovereign be, one king of all," t <lb/>
            is not more appropriate to be said with respect to cities and <lb/>
            men than to the world and God, for it follows inevitably <note type="footnote"> * It will be seen that a great part of this treatise is identical, word <lb/>
            for word, with that on the Incorruptibility of the World. </note><note type="footnote"> t Horn. II. ii. 204. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            that there must be one Creator and Master of one world; <lb/>
            and this position having been laid down and conceded as a <lb/>
            preliminary, it is only consistent with sense to connect with <lb/>
            it what follows from it of necessity. Let us now, therefore, <lb/>
            consider what inferences these are.</p>
          <p>God being one being, has two supreme powers of the <lb/>
            greatest importance. By means of these powers the incor­ <lb/>
            poreal world, appreciable only by the intellect, was put <lb/>
            together, which is the archetypal model of this world which <lb/>
            is visible to us, being formed in such a manner as to be <lb/>
            perceptible to our invisible conceptions just as the other is <lb/>
            to our eyes. Therefore some persons, marvelling at the <lb/>
            nature of both these worlds, have not only worshipped them <lb/>
            in their entirety as gods, but have also deified the most <lb/>
            beautiful parts of them, I mean for instance the sun, and the <lb/>
            moon, and the whole heaven, which, without any fear or <lb/>
            reverence, they called gods. And Moses, perceiving the <lb/>
            ideas which they entertained, says, " O Lord, King of all <lb/>
            gods,"* in order to point out the great superiority of the <lb/>
            Ruler to his subjects.</p>
          <p>And the original founder of the Jewish nation was a <lb/>
            Chaldæan by birth, being the son of a father who was much <lb/>
            devoted to the study of astronomy, and being among people <lb/>
            who were great studiers of mathematical science, who think <lb/>
            the stars, and the whole heaven, and the whole world gods; <lb/>
            and they say that both good and evil result from their <lb/>
            speculations and belief, since they do not believe in anything <lb/>
            as a cause which is apart from those things which are visible <lb/>
            to the outward senses.</p>
          <p>But what can be worse than this, or more calculated to <lb/>
            display the want of true nobility existing in the soul, than <lb/>
            the notion of causes in general being secondary and created <lb/>
            causes, combined with an ignorance of the one first cause, <lb/>
            the uncreated God, the Creator of the universe, who for <lb/>
            these and innumerable other reasons is most excellent, <lb/>
            reasons which because of their magnitude human intellect is <lb/>
            unable to apprehend ? but this founder of the Jewish nation <lb/>
            having conceived an idea of him in his mind, and looking <lb/>
            upon him as the true God, forsook his native country and <lb/>
            his family, and his father's house, knowing that if he <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy x. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            remained, the deceits of the polytheistic doctrine also re­ <lb/>
            maining in his soul would render his intellect incapable of <lb/>
            discovering the nature of the one God, who is alone ever­ <lb/>
            lasting, and the father of everything else, whether appre­ <lb/>
            ciable only by the intellect or perceptible to the outward <lb/>
            senses; but if he departed and emigrated, then he saw that <lb/>
            deceit would also depart from his mind, which would then <lb/>
            change its erroneous opinions into truth. And at the same <lb/>
            time the oracular commands of God, which had been given <lb/>
            to him, did further excite the desire which he felt to become <lb/>
            acquainted with the living God. And he went forth like a <lb/>
            man under the immediate guidance of others, with the most <lb/>
            unhesitating promptness, to search after the knowledge of <lb/>
            the one God; and he did not relax in his search till he had <lb/>
            arrived at a more accurate and correct perception, not <lb/>
            indeed of his essences (for that is impossible), but of his <lb/>
            existence and of his providence; on which account he is the <lb/>
            first man of whom it is said that he believed in God, since <lb/>
            he was the first who had an accurate and positive notion of <lb/>
            him, believing that there is one supreme cause of all things, <lb/>
            which by his providence takes care of the world and of all <lb/>
            things that are therein.</p>
          <p>Since the Creator of the world bringing an essence pre­ <lb/>
            viously without any order and in complete confusion, into <lb/>
            distinct order and regularity, began to arrange and adorn <lb/>
            the earth and the water, and established them in the middle <lb/>
            of the world, and the trees, and air, and fire he drew up from <lb/>
            the middle to the higher regions, and he fixed the regions of <lb/>
            the sether all around, placing it as a boundary to and a pre­ <lb/>
            server of the things which were inside, from which also it <lb/>
            derived its name of heaven.* And these things, then, were <lb/>
            the perfect seeds of the whole universe, but the great and <lb/>
            all productive tree raised from this seed is this world, of <lb/>
            which the aforesaid branches are the offshoots.</p>
          <p>II. Where, then, God placed the roots, and what founda­ <lb/>
            tion it has upon which it is so firmly fixed like a statue, we <lb/>
            must now consider. It is not natural that any body which <lb/>
            is left behind should wander out of its limits, since God has <lb/>
            made and arranged in its proper place, the materials of the <note type="footnote"> * "Opog is the Greek word for boundary, from which Philo thinks <lb/>
            that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς</foreign>, "heaven," is derived. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            whole universe. For it was fitting that the greatest of all <lb/>
            works, being also the most perfect, should be created by the <lb/>
            greatest of all workmen. And it would not have been com­ <lb/>
            pletely perfect if it had not been completed in perfect parts. <lb/>
            So that if this world consists of every kind of material, <lb/>
            nothing being beyond, and not even the most insignificant <lb/>
            thing being omitted, it follows of necessity that whatever <lb/>
            is outside the world must either be vacuum or nothing at <lb/>
            all. If it be a vacuum, then how can it be found to balance <lb/>
            the world, which is full and closely packed, and the heaviest <lb/>
            of all things, when there is nothing solid to support it P <lb/>
            from which consideration it would appear to resemble a <lb/>
            vision. Since the mind is always looking for a corporeal <lb/>
            basis, it is natural to suppose that one whole should have <lb/>
            such a thing if it happens to be put in motion, and the <lb/>
            world above all things, inasmuch as it is the greatest of <lb/>
            bodies, and as it embraces in its bosom a multitude of other <lb/>
            bodies as its own appropriate parts. Therefore, if any one <lb/>
            wishes to escape the perplexities which arise in treating of <lb/>
            doubtful matters, let him speak his mind freely, and affirm <lb/>
            that there is no material so strong as to be able to support <lb/>
            the weight of the world. But the eternal law of the ever­ <lb/>
            lasting God is the strong and lasting support of the universe. <lb/>
            This law being extended from the centre of the world to its <lb/>
            furthest extremities, and again back from its extremities to <lb/>
            the centre, moves on in the unwearied irresistible course of <lb/>
            nature, uniting and binding together all the parts of the <lb/>
            universe. For the Father who established it made it to be <lb/>
            the indissoluble bond of the universe.</p>
          <p>Therefore we are naturally led to conclude that the whole <lb/>
            earth will not be dissolved by water, which its bosoms con­ <lb/>
            tain ; nor again will fire be extinguished by the air, nor <lb/>
            again will the air be burnt up and consumed by fire, since <lb/>
            the divine law has placed itself as a boundary to keep all <lb/>
            these elements distinct from one another. As yet the all­ <lb/>
            productive plant was not rooted, and had not the power <lb/>
            which was to be derived from being rooted. But of the <lb/>
            subordinate, particular, and less important plants, some <lb/>
            were moveable in such a way as easily to change their places, <lb/>
            and some, without being liable to any change of places, were <lb/>
             <pb n="184"/>
            made as if they were to stand for ever in the same position. <lb/>
            Those therefore which are exposed to a motion which involves <lb/>
            a change of place, which we call animals, were added to the <lb/>
            most entire and perfect parts of the universe. The earth <lb/>
            receiving the terrestrial animals, the water the aquatic <lb/>
            animals; the air those creatures which fly; and the stars <lb/>
            being assigned to the heaven.</p>
          <p>III. But the Creator created two different kinds both in <lb/>
            the earth, and in the water, and in the air. In the air he <lb/>
            placed those animals which fly, and other powers also which <lb/>
            cannot by any means, or on any occasion, be comprehended <lb/>
            by the outward senses. Thus the company of incorporeal <lb/>
            souls is arranged in regular order according to their nature. <lb/>
            For it is said that some of them are separated off and <lb/>
            assigned to mortal bodies, and that, at certain definite and <lb/>
            predetermined periods, they again depart from them. But <lb/>
            that others of a more divine nature are utterly regardless <lb/>
            of any situation on earth, but are raised to a great height, <lb/>
            and placed in the æther itself, being of the purest possible <lb/>
            character, which those among the Greeks who have studied <lb/>
            philosophy call heroes and dæmones, and which Moses, <lb/>
            giving them a most felicitous appellation, calls angels, acting <lb/>
            as they do the part of ambassadors and messengers, an­ <lb/>
            nouncing to the subjects all kinds of blessings from their <lb/>
            rulers, and acting as servants to the king to whom they are <lb/>
            subject; and they, descending into the body as into a river, <lb/>
            at one time are carried away by the violence of a most irre­ <lb/>
            sistible current and swallowed up, and at other times, being <lb/>
            wholly unable to resist the powers of destruction, at first, <lb/>
            indeed, raise their heads above the flood, and afterwards sink <lb/>
            down again to the place from whence they have started.</p>
          <p>These, then, are the souls of those who devote themselves <lb/>
            to the vigorous study of philosophy respecting divine sub­ <lb/>
            jects, from the beginning to the end of their existence <lb/>
            studying things which may concern them after the life <lb/>
            has left the body, that thus they may enjoy an incorporeal <lb/>
            and endless life in the presence of the uncreated and im­ <lb/>
            mortal God. But those souls of other men which I have <lb/>
            spoken of as being overwhelmed, being such as have disre­ <lb/>
            garded wisdom, giving themselves up to uncertain circum­ <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            stances, such as depend wholly on chance, of which none <lb/>
            have any reference to the soul or to the intellect, but all to <lb/>
            the body, which is but a corpse to which we are joined, or <lb/>
            to other things even more inanimate and insensible than <lb/>
            that; I mean such things as glory, and riches, and power, <lb/>
            and honour, and all such other things as through the de­ <lb/>
            ceitfulness of false opinions are looked upon as real and <lb/>
            living objects by people who do not see what is really <lb/>
            beautiful.</p>
          <p>Therefore, if you look upon souls, and dæmones, and angels, <lb/>
            as things differing indeed in name, but as meaning in reality <lb/>
            one and the same thing, you will thus get rid of the heaviest <lb/>
            of all evils, superstition. For as people in general speak of <lb/>
            good dæmones and bad dæmones, in the same manner also <lb/>
            do they speak of good and bad souls; and so they speak of <lb/>
            some angels as being by their title worthy ambassadors from <lb/>
            men to God, and from God to men, being sacred and in­ <lb/>
            violable guardians on account of their blameless and most <lb/>
            excellent service which they have allotted to them. And, <lb/>
            again, if you look upon others as unholy and unworthy of <lb/>
            any such appellation, you will not err. And the Psalmist <lb/>
            himself is a witness in favour of what I have here asserted, <lb/>
            where he speaks as follows: " He sent among them the <lb/>
            anger of his wrath, by the operation of evil angels."*</p>
          <p>Again, all animals that swim and zoophytes are allotted to <lb/>
            the water, and all terrestrial animals and plants to the land. <lb/>
            And the plants he placed with their heads downwards, fixing <lb/>
            their heads in the deepest parts of the earth ; but the heads <lb/>
            of the irrational animals he dragged up from the earth and <lb/>
            placed upon a lofty neck, placing the fore-feet beneath them <lb/>
            as a kind of pedestal. But man has had a separate forma­ <lb/>
            tion of a higher character; for in the case of other animals, <lb/>
            God has placed their eyes in the side of their heads and <lb/>
            bent them down to the ground, on which account they are <lb/>
            all inclined downwards to the earth. But the eyes of man, <lb/>
            on the other hand, he has raised up, that he might behold <lb/>
            the heavens, being not a terrestrial but a celestial plant, as <lb/>
            the old saying is.t <note type="footnote"> * Psalm lxxvii. 49. </note><note type="footnote"> + This is in accordance with the idea of Ovid, who says— ' <lb/>

          <p>But the other class, who affirm that our intellect is a <lb/>
            portion of ethereal nature, connect man in a relationship <lb/>
            with the air. Accordingly, the great Moses has not spoken <lb/>
            of the rational soul as it resembled in its species any created <lb/>
            thing, but he has called it the image of the divine and invi­ <lb/>
            sible God, looking upon it to be a glorious and carefully <lb/>
            wrought image, the seal of God, the character of which is <lb/>
            the everlasting Word ; for, says he, " God breathed into his <lb/>
            face the breath of life."* So that it follows inevitably <lb/>
            that he who received it must be made in the image and <lb/>
            likeness of him who sent it. On which account he also says <lb/>
            that man was created in the image of God, and not in the <lb/>
            likeness of any created thing.</p>
          <p>IV. But, taking up our discourse again at the beginning <lb/>
            for the sake of clearness, let us say that of bodies some <lb/>
            have put on habit, and others nature, and others soul, <lb/>
            and others a rational soul. Therefore those stocks and <lb/>
            stones which are torn from any intimate connection, have <lb/>
            made for themselves that strongest of all forms, namely <lb/>
            habit, and that is a breath returning constantly to itself; <lb/>
            for it begins at the centre and extends to the furthest ex­ <lb/>
            tremities, and when it has touched the outermost circum­ <lb/>
            ference it turns back again until it arrives at the same place <lb/>
            from which it originally started. This is the continued <lb/>
            course of habit over which it runs and returns. And he has <lb/>
            allotted a nature of their own to plants, having combined it <lb/>
            of many powers, especially the nutritious and the generative <lb/>
            power. And the Creator has made the soul different from <lb/>
            nature in three particulars—the outward sense, and fancy, <lb/>
            and impulse. Now plants have no participation in any of <lb/>
            these things, but every living animal has a share in all of <lb/>
            them. Therefore the outward sense, as its very name in my <lb/>
            opinion shows, is a certain imposition which represents to <note type="footnote"> Os homini sublime dedit, cælumque tueri <lb/>
            Jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus. <lb/>
            Which may be translated­ <lb/>
            " And while all other creatures from their birth. <lb/>
            With downcast eyes gaze on their kindred earth, <lb/>
            Man walks erect, and proudly scans the heaven <lb/>
            From which he sprung, to which his hopes are given." </note><note type="footnote">* Genesis it. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="187"/>
            the intellect the things which have appeared to it. And it <lb/>
            represents to the fancy a sort of outline in the soul, being, <lb/>
            as it were, a kind of representation of light; for those things <lb/>
            which each of the outward senses has introduced, like a ring <lb/>
            as it were or a seal, it impresses on them its own character, <lb/>
            or else it preserves the impression which has been made <lb/>
            until the rival of memory, forgetfulness, having softened the <lb/>
            impression, at least makes it very dim, or else entirely <lb/>
            effaces it; and what has appeared to have been impressed <lb/>
            upon it disposes the soul at one time as if it belonged to it, <lb/>
            and at another time as if it belonged to some other: and <lb/>
            this feeling is called impulse, which those who have at­ <lb/>
            tempted to give accurate definitions have called the primary <lb/>
            motion of the soul.</p>
          <p>V. In such important particulars are animals superior to <lb/>
            plants. Let us now therefore see in what man is superior <lb/>
            to the other animals. He now has received as an especial <lb/>
            and pre-eminent honour, the gift of intellect, by which he is <lb/>
            accustomed to comprehend the natures of all things, whether <lb/>
            they be bodies or things; for as the predominant part in <lb/>
            the body is the sight, and as the nature of light is the most <lb/>
            important part of the universe, so in the same manner the <lb/>
            most important and influential of all the parts in us is the <lb/>
            mind; for this is the light of the soul, being irradiated and <lb/>
            enlightened by its own beams, by which that dense and pro­ <lb/>
            found darkness, ignorance of facts which was shed around it, <lb/>
            is dissipated.</p>
          <p>And this portion of the soul is not composed of the same <lb/>
            elements as those of which the other parts are made, but it <lb/>
            has a pure and more excellent essence, from which the <lb/>
            divine natures were made; on which account the intellect <lb/>
            alone, of all the parts within us, appears very reasonably and <lb/>
            naturally to be imperishable, for that is the only portion <lb/>
            which the Father who generated it has thought worthy of <lb/>
            freedom, and loosing the bands of necessity, he has allowed <lb/>
            it to roam at large without restraint, having endowed it with <lb/>
            a share of his own most glorious and becoming attribute, <lb/>
            free-will, the highest present which it was able to receive. <lb/>
            For the other animals in whose souls there does not exist <lb/>
            that intellect which is thus especially appropriated to free­ <lb/>
            dom, have been given up to men to submit to their yoke <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            and to receive their bridle in their mouths, so as to serve <lb/>
            them as servants obey their masters.</p>
          <p>But man having a spontaneous will, subject to no prompt­ <lb/>
            ings but those of his own nature, and exerting his energies <lb/>
            in accordance with his own deliberate purpose, is very <lb/>
            properly subject to blame for whatever unjust actions he <lb/>
            commits from deliberate intention, and to praise for all the <lb/>
            good deeds which he intentionally performs ; for as he has <lb/>
            received from God a power of voluntary motion, and as he <lb/>
            is in this respect like unto God himself, being delivered <lb/>
            from all subservience to that most severe and grievous <lb/>
            mistress, necessity, he very properly is open to accusa­ <lb/>
            tion when he does not pay worship to that being who <lb/>
            has thus delivered him. Therefore he will most justly in <lb/>
            such a case suffer the punishment which has been inexorably <lb/>
            pronounced against ungrateful people who do not deserve <lb/>
            freedom. On which account also, the body being raised up <lb/>
            towards the purest portion of the universe, the heaven, <lb/>
            raises its eyes upwards, that so by an observation of what <lb/>
            is visible, it may arrive at an adequate comprehension of <lb/>
            what is invisible.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, it would be impossible to behold the <lb/>
            attraction of the intellect towards the living God, excepting <lb/>
            as far as those who are attracted towards him can them­ <lb/>
            selves perceive it, for each man in an individual and especial <lb/>
            degree knows what happens to himself, he has made a visible <lb/>
            image of the invisible eye, namely, the eyes of the body <lb/>
            which are thus able to look towards the sky. For when the <lb/>
            eyes, which are made of perishable materials, have gone to <lb/>
            such heights as even to soar upwards to the heaven which <lb/>
            is removed to such an immense distance from the regions of <lb/>
            the earth, and to touch its borders, to how great a distance <lb/>
            must we not suppose that the eyes of the soul can reach ? <lb/>
            which, being excited by a vehement desire to see the one <lb/>
            Being clearly and distinctly, stretch forward not only to the <lb/>
            furthest extremity of the sky, but, leaving beneath them the <lb/>
            boundaries of the universal world, hasten onwards to the <lb/>
            uncreated.</p>
          <p>VI. Having now, therefore, gone through the whole <lb/>
            question of the more important plants in the world, let us <lb/>
            see in what manner also the all-wise God has fashioned the <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            trees which exist in man, that lesser world. Therefore im­ <lb/>
            mediately having taken our body as a region of fertile soil, <lb/>
            he has made in it the outward senses as so many channels ; <lb/>
            and then he has carefully trained each of those outward <lb/>
            senses as a plant susceptible of cultivation and of the <lb/>
            greatest use, implanting the sense of hearing in the ears, and <lb/>
            that of seeing in the eyes, and that of smell in the nostrils, <lb/>
            and all the other senses in the places akin to and appropriate <lb/>
            to them. And I have a witness in favour of this my argu­ <lb/>
            ment in that god-like man who speaks thus in the Psalms : <lb/>
            " He that planted the ear, shall he not hear P and he that <lb/>
            fashioned the eye, must not he see P *</p>
          <p>Moreover, those other faculties which reside apart from <lb/>
            the main body, being situated in the legs and hands and the <lb/>
            other parts of the body, whether within or without, all <lb/>
            these faculties, I say, are noble and excellent offshoots. <lb/>
            And the more excellent and more perfect parts he very <lb/>
            appropriately stationed near the dominant portion of the <lb/>
            whole, as being in the centre, and able pre-eminently to <lb/>
            bring forth fruit, as being the lord of the whole. And these <lb/>
            faculties are perception and comprehension, and felicity of <lb/>
            conjecture, and study, and recollection, and habit, and dis­ <lb/>
            position, and every variety of art, and certainty of know­ <lb/>
            ledge, and an ever-mindful apprehension of the speculations <lb/>
            of every kind of virtue. Now, no one can properly or <lb/>
            sufficiently cultivate any one of these within, but the one <lb/>
            uncreated Maker of them, and who has not merely created <lb/>
            them, but who also makes all these plants to correspond to <lb/>
            everything which takes place; he alone can manage them and <lb/>
            perfect them as they should be perfected.</p>
          <p>VII. And the way in which Paradise was planted is in <lb/>
            strict conformity with what has been here said; for we read <lb/>
            that " God planted a Paradise in Eden, towards the east, <lb/>
            and there he placed the man whom he had made."t Now, <lb/>
            to think that this means that God planted vines and olives, <lb/>
            and trees of apples and pomegranates, and things of that <lb/>
            kind, is great and incurable folly. But in order that no one <lb/>
            might imagine that the Creator had need of anything that <lb/>
            he had created, Moses has made a most important declara­ <lb/>
            tion when he says, " The Lord, the King of ages, for ever <note type="footnote"> * Psalm xciii 9. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis ii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            and ever."* Accordingly, God is both the Father, and <lb/>
            the Creator, and the Governor, in reality and truth, of all <lb/>
            the things that are in heaven and in the whole world. And, <lb/>
            indeed, the future is concealed and separated from the <lb/>
            present moment at one time by a brief, and at another time <lb/>
            by a long interval. But God is also the Creator of time, <lb/>
            for he is the Father of that which is the father of time; <lb/>
            and the father of time is the world, which proves that its <lb/>
            own birth is the motion of time. But nothing is future to <lb/>
            God, because he is in possession of and the author of the <lb/>
            boundaries of time; for it is not time, but rather the arche­ <lb/>
            type and model of time. But in eternity nothing is passed, <lb/>
            nothing is future, but everything is at the present moment.</p>
          <p>VIII. Having now, then, discussed these matters at suf­ <lb/>
            ficient length, we must proceed to investigate its imperish­ <lb/>
            ableness. Now, there are three opinions in vogue among <lb/>
            the philosophers on this subject: some affirming it is everlast­ <lb/>
            ing, and uncreated, and free from all liability to destruction ; <lb/>
            others, on the contrary, that it is created and perishable. <lb/>
            There is also a sect which has adopted some portions of <lb/>
            the doctrine of each of the beforementioned parties, taking <lb/>
            from the latter sect the doctrine that it is created, and from <lb/>
            the former the idea that it is imperishable; and thus they <lb/>
            have left a mixed opinion, looking upon it as at the same <lb/>
            time created and yet imperishable.</p>
          <p>Therefore Democritus, and Epicurus, and the chief body <lb/>
            of the philosophers of the Stoic school, leave the generation <lb/>
            and also the destructibility of the world; but they do not all <lb/>
            do so in the same manner. For some give a sketch of many <lb/>
            worlds, the creation of which they attribute to the concourse <lb/>
            and conflicting combination of atoms, and their destruc­ <lb/>
            tion they attribute to the repercussion and shattering of <lb/>
            what has been thus formed. But the Stoics affirm that there <lb/>
            is one world, and that God is the cause of its creation, but <lb/>
            that God is not the cause of its destruction; but that the <lb/>
            power which is contained in existing things, in the long <lb/>
            periods of never-ending time, attracts everything to itself, <lb/>
            from which again a regeneration of the world is caused by <lb/>
            the prudence of the Creator.</p>
          <p>But Aristotle pronounced the world to be both uncreated <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            and imperishable, and he affirmed that those who maintained a <lb/>
            contrary doctrine were guilty of terrible impiety, as they con­ <lb/>
            sidered that so great a work of God was in no respect superior <lb/>
            to things made by the hand of men. And they say too that <lb/>
            it has been proved to be both uncreated and imperishable by <lb/>
            Plato in his Timaeus.</p>
          <p>But some persons interpret Plato's words sophistically, and <lb/>
            think that he affirms that the world was created, not inas­ <lb/>
            much as it has had a beginning of creation, but inasmuch as <lb/>
            if it had been created it could not possibly have existed in any <lb/>
            other manner than that in which it actually does exist as has <lb/>
            been described, or else because it is in its creation and change <lb/>
            that the parts are seen. But the fore mentioned opinion is <lb/>
            better and truer, not only because throughout the whole <lb/>
            treatise he affirms that the Creator of the gods is also the father <lb/>
            and creator and maker of everything, and that the world is a <lb/>
            most beautiful work of his and his offspring, being an imita­ <lb/>
            tion visible to the outward senses of an archetypal model <lb/>
            appreciable only by the intellect, comprehending in itself as <lb/>
            many objects of the outward senses as the model does objects <lb/>
            of the intellect, since it is a most perfect impression of a <lb/>
            most perfect model, and is addressed to the outward sense as <lb/>
            the other is to the intellect.</p>
          <p>But also because Aristotle bears witness to this fact in the <lb/>
            case of Plato, who, from his great reverence for philosophy, <lb/>
            would never have spoken falsely.</p>
          <p>But some persons think that the father of the Platonic <lb/>
            theory was the poet Hesiod, as they conceive that the world is <lb/>
            spoken of by him as created and indestructible; as created, <lb/>
            when he says,— <lb/>
            "First did Chaos rule; <lb/>
            Then the broad-chested earth was brought to light, <lb/>
            Foundation firm and lasting for whatever <lb/>
            Exists among mankind <lb/>
            and a; indestructible, because he has given no hint of its dis­ <lb/>
            solution or destruction.</p>
          <p>Now Chaos was conceived by Aristotle to be a place, because <lb/>
            it is absolutely necessary that a place to receive them must be <lb/>
            in existence before bodies. But some of the Stoics think that <note type="footnote"> * Hesiiod, Theogon. 116. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            it is water, imagining that its name has been derived from <lb/>
            effusion.* But however that may be, it is exceedingly plain <lb/>
            that the world is spoken of by Hesiod as having been created : <lb/>
            and a very long time before him Moses, the lawgiver of the <lb/>
            Jews, had said in his sacred volumes that the world' was both <lb/>
            created and indestructible, and the number of the books is five. <lb/>
            The first of which he entitled Genesis, in which he begins in <lb/>
            the following manner: " In the beginning God created the <lb/>
            heaven and the earth; and the earth was invisible and without <lb/>
            form."</p>
          <p>IX. But we must place those arguments first which make <lb/>
            out the world to be uncreated and indestructible, because of <lb/>
            our respect for that which is visible, employing an appropriate <lb/>
            commencement. To all things which are liable to destruction <lb/>
            there are two causes of that destruction, one being internal <lb/>
            and the other external; therefore you may find iron, and <lb/>
            brass, and all other substances of that kind destroyed by <lb/>
            themselves when rust, like a creeping disease, overruns and <lb/>
            devours them; and by external causes when, if a house or a <lb/>
            city is burnt, they also are consumed in the conflagration, <lb/>
            being melted by the violent impetuosity of the fire.</p>
          <p>A similar end also befalls animals, partly when they are <lb/>
            sick of diseases arising internally, and partly when they are <lb/>
            destroyed by external causes, being sacrificed, or stoned, or <lb/>
            burnt, or when they endure an unclean death by hanging.</p>
          <p>And if the world also is destroyed, then it must of necessity <lb/>
            be so either by some external cause, or else by some one of <lb/>
            the powers which exist within itself; and both these alter­ <lb/>
            natives are impossible, for there is nothing whatever outside of <lb/>
            the world, since all things are brought together in order to <lb/>
            make it complete and full, for it is in this way that it will be <lb/>
            one, and whole, and free from old age ; it will be one, because <lb/>
            if anything were left outside of it, then another world might <lb/>
            be created resembling that which exists now; and whole, <lb/>
            because the whole of its essence is expended on itself; and <lb/>
            exempt from old age and from all disease, since those bodies <lb/>
            which are liable to be destroyed by disease or old age are <lb/>
            violently overthrown by external causes, such as heat, and <lb/>
            cold, and other contrary qualities, no power of which is able to <lb/>
            escape so as to surround and attack the world, all those being <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χύσις</foreign>, as if chaos were derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">Χέω</foreign>, 11 to pour." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            entirely enclosed within, without any part whatever being <lb/>
            separated from the rest.</p>
          <p>But if indeed there is any external thing it must by all <lb/>
            means be a vacuum, or else a nature absolutely impossible, <lb/>
            which it would be impossible should either suffer or do any­ <lb/>
            thing. And again, it will also not be dissolved by any <lb/>
            cause existing within itself; first of all because, if it were, <lb/>
            then the part would be greater and more powerful than the <lb/>
            whole, which is the greatest possible absurdity, for the world, <lb/>
            enjoying an unsurpassable power, influences all its parts, and <lb/>
            is not itself influenced or moved by any one of them; in the <lb/>
            second place because, since there are two causes of corruption, <lb/>
            the one being internal and the other external, those things <lb/>
            which are competent to admit the one must also by all means <lb/>
            be liable to the other; and a proof of this may be found in <lb/>
            oxen, and horses, and men, and other animals of similar kinds, <lb/>
            because it is their nature to be destroyed by the sword, or to <lb/>
            be liable to die by disease.</p>
          <p>X. Since, therefore, the arrangement of the world is such as <lb/>
            I have endeavoured to describe it, so that there is no part what­ <lb/>
            ever left out, so as for any force to be applied, it has now been <lb/>
            proved that the world will not be destroyed by any external <lb/>
            thing, because in fact nothing whatever external has been left <lb/>
            at all; nor will it be destroyed by anything in itself on account <lb/>
            of the proof which has already been considered and stated, <lb/>
            according to which that which was obnoxious to the power of <lb/>
            one of those causes was also naturally susceptible of the <lb/>
            influence of the other.</p>
          <p>And there are testimonies also in the Timseus to the fact <lb/>
            of the world being exempt from disease and not liable to <lb/>
            destruction, such as these: " Accordingly, of the four ele­ <lb/>
            ments the constitution of the world receives each in all its <lb/>
            integrity; for he who compounded it made it to consist of the <lb/>
            whole of fire, and the whole of water, and the whole of air, <lb/>
            and the whole of earth, not leaving any portion or any power <lb/>
            of any one of them outside, from the following intentions :— <lb/>
            in the first place, in order that the whole might be as far as <lb/>
            possible a perfect animal made up of perfect parts. And <lb/>
            besides all these things, he ordained that it should be one, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as there is nothing left out of which another similar <lb/>
            world could be composed. Moreover, he willed that it should <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            be exempt from old age, and free from all disease, considering <lb/>
            that those things which in the body are hot or cold, or which <lb/>
            have mighty powers, if standing all around and falling upon <lb/>
            it unseasonably, would be likely to dissolve it, and, by intro­ <lb/>
            ducing diseases and old age, cause it to decay and perish. For <lb/>
            this cause, and because of this reason, God made the whole <lb/>
            universe to consist of entire and perfect elements, and exempt <lb/>
            from old age and free from disease."</p>
          <p>XI. Let this be taken as a testimony delivered by Plato to <lb/>
            the imperishable nature of the world. Its uncreated character <lb/>
            follows from the truth of natural philosophy ; for dissolution <lb/>
            must of necessity attend everything which is born, and incor­ <lb/>
            ruptibility must inevitably belong to everything which is un­ <lb/>
            born ; since the poet who wrote the following iambic verse, <lb/>
            " All that is born must surely die," * <lb/>
            appears to have spoken very correctly when he asserted this <lb/>
            connection of destructibility with birth.</p>
          <p>The argument may be stated in a different way as follows. <lb/>
            All compound things which are destroyed are dissolved into <lb/>
            the elements of which they were compounded ; accordingly, <lb/>
            dissolution is nothing else but a return of everything to its <lb/>
            original constituent parts ; just as, on the contrary, composition <lb/>
            is that which compels the things combined to come together in <lb/>
            a manner contrary to their nature ; and indeed, this appears <lb/>
            to be the most exact truth; for men are composed of the four <lb/>
            elements which together make up the whole of the universe, <lb/>
            the heaven, the earth, the air, and fire, borrowing a few parts <lb/>
            of each in a manner at first sight hardly consistent with <lb/>
            nature. But the things which are thus combined together are <lb/>
            necessarily deprived of a motion in accordance with nature; for <lb/>
            instance, warmth is deprived of its upward motion, and coldness <lb/>
            of its downward tendency, the earthy and somewhat weighty <lb/>
            substance being lightened and assuming the higher place, <lb/>
            which the most earth-like of our own parts, the head, has <lb/>
            obtained in us. But of all bonds, that is the worst which is <lb/>
            forged by violence, and which, being violent, is also short- <lb/>
            lived ; for it is speedily broken by those who are bound in it, <lb/>
            since they become restive from their desire for a motion in ac­ <note type="footnote"> * Timæus, p. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            cordance with nature, to which they hasten; for as the tragic <lb/>
            poet says,*— <lb/>
            " And for things sprung from earth, they must <lb/>
            Return unto their parent dust, <lb/>
            While those from heavenly seed which rise <lb/>
            Are borne uplifted to the skies. <lb/>
            Nought that has once existed dies, <lb/>
            Though often what has been combined <lb/>
            Before, we separated find, <lb/>
            Invested with another form." <lb/>
            And this law and ordinance is established with reference to <lb/>
            everything which is destroyed, that wherever composite things <lb/>
            are existing in combination they are thrown into disorder <lb/>
            instead of into the order in accordance with nature, which they <lb/>
            previously enjoyed, and they are removed to situations opposite <lb/>
            to those in which they were previously placed, so that they <lb/>
            seem in a manner to be sojourners; and when they are dis­ <lb/>
            solved again, then they return to the appropriate parts allotted <lb/>
            to them by nature.</p>
          <p>But since the world has no participation in that irregularity <lb/>
            which exists in the things which I have just been mentioning, <lb/>
            let us stop awhile and consider this point.</p>
          <p>If the world were liable to corruption and destruction, it <lb/>
            follows of necessity that all its parts would at present be <lb/>
            arranged in a position not in accordance with nature : but it is <lb/>
            impious even to imagine such a thing as this; for all the parts <lb/>
            of the world have received the most excellent position possible, <lb/>
            and an arrangement of the purest symmetry and harmony; so <lb/>
            that each individual part, being content with its place as a <lb/>
            native country to it, does not seek any change for the better. <lb/>
            On this account it is that the most central position of all has <lb/>
            been assigned to the earth, to which all things, belonging to <lb/>
            it adhere, and to which they descend again even if you throw <lb/>
            them into the air: and this is a proof that their place is in <lb/>
            accordance with nature; for wherever anything is borne with­ <lb/>
            out any violence, and where it then remains firm and stationary, <lb/>
            that is clearly its natural place. And then, in the second <lb/>
            place, water was poured over the earth, and air and fire <lb/>
            have gone from the central to the upper part, air having <lb/>
            received for its portion the region which is on the borders <note type="footnote"> * A fragment from the Chrysippus of Euripides. </note> <note type="footnote"> O 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            between air and fire, and fire having received the highest place <lb/>
            of all: on which account, if you light a torch and press it down <lb/>
            towards the ground, nevertheless the flame will still turn in a <lb/>
            contrary direction, and lightening itself in accordance with the <lb/>
            natural motion of fire, will rise upwards: if, then, motion con­ <lb/>
            trary to nature is the cause of corruptibility and destruction in <lb/>
            the case of other animals, but if in the case of the world every <lb/>
            one of its parts is arranged in complete accordance with <lb/>
            nature, having had appropriate positions allotted to each of <lb/>
            them, then surely the world must most justly be pronounced <lb/>
            incorruptible and imperishable.</p>
          <p>XII. Moreover this point is manifest to every one, that every <lb/>
            nature is desirous to keep and preserve, and if it were possible <lb/>
            to make immortal, everything of which it is the nature; the <lb/>
            nature of trees, for instance, desires to preserve trees, and the <lb/>
            nature of animals desires to preserve each individual animal. <lb/>
            But particular nature is of necessity unable to conduct what <lb/>
            it belongs to to eternity ; for want, or heat, or cold, or innu­ <lb/>
            merable other ordinary circumstances, when they affect parti­ <lb/>
            cular things, shake them and dissolve the bond which previ­ <lb/>
            ously held them together, and at last break them to pieces; <lb/>
            but if nothing resembling any of these things were lying in <lb/>
            wait outside, then in that case nature itself, as far as it is <lb/>
            possible, would preserve everything both great and small free <lb/>
            from old age.</p>
          <p>It follows therefore of necessity, that the nature of the <lb/>
            world must desire the durability of the universe ; for it is not <lb/>
            worse than particular natures, so that it should run away and <lb/>
            desert its proper duties, and attempt to produce disease <lb/>
            instead of health, and corruption and destruction instead of <lb/>
            complete safety, since,* <lb/>
            " High over all she lifts her beauteous face, <lb/>
            And towers above her nymphs with heavenly grace, <lb/>
            Fair as they all appear."</p>
          <p>But if this be true, then the world cannot be capable of <lb/>
            destruction. Why so? Because the nature which holds it <lb/>
            together is itself invincible by reason of its exceeding <lb/>
            strength and power, by which it gets the mastery over every <lb/>
            thing else which might be likely to injure it; wherefore Plato <note type="footnote"> * Homer, Odyssey vi. 107, where the lines quoted are applied to <lb/>
            Latona among her nymphs. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            has well said :*—" For nothing ever departed from it, nor did <lb/>
            anything ever come to it from any quarter; for that was not <lb/>
            possible ; for there was nothing in existence which could come ; <lb/>
            for since it supplies itself with nutriment out of its own con­ <lb/>
            sumption, it also does everything and suffers everything in <lb/>
            itself and by itself, and is compounded with the most consum­ <lb/>
            mate art. For he who created it thought that it would be <lb/>
            better if wholly self-sufficient, than if in continual need of <lb/>
            accessories from other quarters."</p>
          <p>XIII. However, this argument also is a most demonstra­ <lb/>
            tive one, on which I know that vast numbers of philosophers <lb/>
            pride themselves as one most accurately worked out, and <lb/>
            altogether irresistible; for they inquire what reason there is <lb/>
            for God's destroying the world. For. if he destroys it at all <lb/>
            he must do so either with the intention of never making a <lb/>
            world again, or with the object of creating a second fresh one ; <lb/>
            now the former idea is inconsistent with the character of God; <lb/>
            for it is proper to change disorder into order, and not order <lb/>
            into disorder: in the second place, it is so because it would <lb/>
            give rise to repentance, which is an affliction and a disease of <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>For he ought either never to have created a world at all, <lb/>
            or else, if he judged that it was a fitting employment for him, <lb/>
            he ought to have been pleased with it after it was made. But <lb/>
            the second reason deserves no superficial examination ; for if <lb/>
            he were intending to make another world instead of that which <lb/>
            exists at present, then of necessity this second world that <lb/>
            would be made, in that case, would be either worse than, or <lb/>
            similar to, or better than the first; everyone of which ideas is <lb/>
            inadmissible; for if the new world is to be worse than the <lb/>
            former, then the maker must be also worse: but all the works <lb/>
            of God are without blemish, beyond all reproach and wholly <lb/>
            faultless, inasmuch as they are wrought with the most consum <lb/>
            mate skill and knowledge ; for as the proverb says ;— <lb/>
            "For e'en a woman's wisdom's not so coarse <lb/>
            As to despise the good and choose the worse." <lb/>
            But it is consistent with the character of, and becoming to <lb/>
            God to give form to what is shapeless, and to invest what is <lb/>
            most ugly with admirable beauty.</p>
          <p>Again, if the new world is to be exactly like the old one, <note type="footnote"> * Timæus, p. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="198"/>
            then the maker is only wasting his labour, and differs in no <lb/>
            respect from infant children who, very often while playing on <lb/>
            the sea shore raise up little mounds of sand, and then pull <lb/>
            them down again with their hands and destroy them; for it <lb/>
            would have been much better than making another world <lb/>
            exactly like the former, neither to take anything from, nor to <lb/>
            add anything to, nor to change either for the better or for the <lb/>
            worse, what existed originally, but to let it remain just as it <lb/>
            was.</p>
          <p>If, on the other hand, he is about to make a world better <lb/>
            than the former one, then the maker too must be better than <lb/>
            the maker of the former world, so that when he made the <lb/>
            former world he was inferior both in his skill and in his intel­ <lb/>
            lect, which it is impious even to imagine, for God is at all <lb/>
            times equal and similar to himself, being neither capable of <lb/>
            any relaxation which can make him worse, nor of any extension <lb/>
            which can make him better. Men, indeed, do admit of such <lb/>
            inequalities in either direction, being naturally liable to alter <lb/>
            either for the better or for the worse, and continually admitting <lb/>
            of increase, and advance, and improvement, and everything <lb/>
            contrary to these states ; and besides this, the works of us who <lb/>
            are but mortal men may very appropriately be perishable, but <lb/>
            the works of the immortal must in all consistency and reason <lb/>
            be likewise imperishable, for it is natural that what is made <lb/>
            should resemble the nature of the maker.</p>
          <p>XIV. But Boethus adduces the most convincing arguments. <lb/>
            which we shall proceed to mention immediately; for if. says he, <lb/>
            the world was created and is liable to destruction, then some­ <lb/>
            thing will be made out of nothing, which appears to be most <lb/>
            absurd even to the Stoics. Why so? Because it is not <lb/>
            possible to discover any cause of destruction either within or <lb/>
            without, which will destroy the world. For on the outside <lb/>
            there is nothing except perhaps a vacuum, inasmuch as all the <lb/>
            elements in their integrity are collected and contained within <lb/>
            it, and within there is no imperfection so great as to be the <lb/>
            cause of dissolution to so great a thing.</p>
          <p>Again, if it is destroyed without any cause, then it is plain <lb/>
            that from something which has no existence will arise the <lb/>
            engendering of destruction, which is an idea quite inadmissible <lb/>
            by reason; and, indeed, they say that there are altogether <lb/>
            three generic manners of corruption, one which arises from <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            division, another which proceeds from a destruction of the <lb/>
            distinctive quality which holds the thing together, and the <lb/>
            third from confusion; therefore the things which consist of a <lb/>
            union of separate members, such as flocks of goats, herds of <lb/>
            oxen, choruses, armies; or, again, bodies, which are com­ <lb/>
            pounded of limbs joined together, are dissolved by disjunction <lb/>
            and separation. But wax, when stamped with a new impres­ <lb/>
            sion, or softened before being remodelled so as to present a <lb/>
            new and different appearance, is corrupted by a destruction of <lb/>
            the distinctive quality which previously held it together. Other <lb/>
            things are corrupted by confusion, as the medicine which the <lb/>
            physicians call tetrapharmacon, for the powers of the drugs <lb/>
            brought together and combined were destroyed in such a <lb/>
            manner as to produce one perfect medicine of especial virtue.</p>
          <p>By which, then, of these modes of corruption is it becoming <lb/>
            to say that the world is destroyed ? By that which is caused <lb/>
            by separation ? No, for it is not compounded of separate <lb/>
            members so that its different parts can be dispersed, nor of <lb/>
            portions joined together so that they can be dissolved; nor is <lb/>
            it united together in a similar manner to our own bodies, for <lb/>
            they have the seeds of decay in themselves, and they are <lb/>
            subject to influence of a great variety of things by which they <lb/>
            are at times injured ; but the power of the world is invincible, <lb/>
            since by its great superiority to other things it has dominion <lb/>
            over everything.</p>
          <p>Is it then destroyed by a complete destruction of its dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive qualities ? This again is impossible, for there remains, <lb/>
            as the adversaries affirm, a quality of arrangement which by <lb/>
            the process of conflagration is only diminished to a lesser sub­ <lb/>
            stance ... Is it destroyed then by confusion ? Away with <lb/>
            such an idea, for in that case it would be necessary to confess <lb/>
            that the corruption of a body can be reduced to a state of <lb/>
            non-existence. Why so? Because if each of the particular <lb/>
            elements were destroyed separately, it would be possible for it <lb/>
            to- become changed into another; but if they are altogether <lb/>
            destroyed at one and the same moment by confusion, then it <lb/>
            would be necessary to imagine what is absolutely impossible.</p>
          <p>XV. Is it not however worth while to examine this question, <lb/>
            in what manner there can be a regeneration of all those things <lb/>
            which have been destroyed by fire, and resolved into fire? for <lb/>
            when their substance has been wholly destroyed by the fire, it <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            follows of necessity that the fire itself must also be extinguished <lb/>
            as no longer having any nourishment. Therefore, as long as <lb/>
            it remained the seminal principle of arrangement was likewise <lb/>
            preserved, but when it is destroyed that principle is destroyed <lb/>
            with it. But it would be impious, and an impiety of double <lb/>
            dye, not only to attribute destruction to the world, but also to <lb/>
            take away the possibility of its regeneration; as if God <lb/>
            delighted in disorder, and irregularity, and all kinds of evil <lb/>
            things. But we must examine this question more accurately, <lb/>
            in the following manner.</p>
          <p>There are three species in fire ; the coal, and the flame, and <lb/>
            the light. Now coal is the fire in its earthy substance, which, <lb/>
            like a sort of spiritual habit, couches and lies hid in a sort of <lb/>
            cavern, pervading it all to its very extremities. And the flame <lb/>
            is that part which, being raised on high, is lifted up from its <lb/>
            fuel. And the light is that which is emitted from the flame, <lb/>
            so as to co-operate with the eyes, in order to enable them to <lb/>
            comprehend what is seen. And the flame occupies the middle <lb/>
            position between the coal and the light; for when it is extin­ <lb/>
            guished it ends in coal, and when it is kindled it excites the <lb/>
            light, which, being deprived of its burning power, blazes. If <lb/>
            therefore, we affirm that the world is dissolved by conflagration, <lb/>
            it would not be coal, because, in that case there will be a great <lb/>
            deal of the earthy substance left behind, in which also fire <lb/>
            must necessarily be contained. But we must agree, that none <lb/>
            of the other bodies subsist any longer, but that earth, and <lb/>
            water, and air, are all dissolved into unmixed fire. Nor, again, <lb/>
            would it become flame; for that can only exist in connexion <lb/>
            with nourishment; and, if nothing is left behind, being de­ <lb/>
            prived of all nourishment it will immediately be extinguished. <lb/>
            It follows from all this, that it cannot become light either; for <lb/>
            light by itself has no substance at all, but flows from the things <lb/>
            before mentioned, coal and flame, not in a great degree from <lb/>
            the coal, but very much from the name ; for it is diffused over <lb/>
            a very great space indeed. But if, as has been already proved, <lb/>
            those things had no existence from the conflagration of all <lb/>
            things, then there could not be any light either. So that it is <lb/>
            impossible for the world to be susceptible of any regeneration, <lb/>
            inasmuch as there is no spermatic principle smouldering <lb/>
            beneath; from which consideration it is plain that it is un­ <lb/>
            created, and that it will be for ever imperishable.</p><pb n="201"/>
            
          <p>XVI. However, besides what has been here said, any one <lb/>
            may use this argument also in corroboration of his opinion, <lb/>
            which will certainly convince all those who are not deter­ <lb/>
            mined to be obstinate beyond all bounds; of those things <lb/>
            which in pairs are exactly contrary to one another it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible that one thing should be, and that the other should not <lb/>
            be; for since there is white it follows as a matter of absolute <lb/>
            necessity that there must also be black, and since there is a <lb/>
            great there must likewise be a little; since there is an odd <lb/>
            there must inevitably be an even ; since there is a sweet there <lb/>
            must be a bitter ; since there is day there must be night ; and <lb/>
            so on in an infinite number of similar cases; but if a conflagra­ <lb/>
            tion should take place, then something would ensue which is <lb/>
            impossible; for then, of things in a pair, the one will happen <lb/>
            and the other will not.</p>
          <p>Come, now, let us consider the matter thus: if everything <lb/>
            is resolved into fire, there is then something light, and rare, <lb/>
            and warm; for all these are the especial properties of fire; but <lb/>
            there can be nothing heavy, or cold, or thick, which are the <lb/>
            opposites of the qualities which I have just enumerated. How <lb/>
            then can any one more completely overturn the idea of the <lb/>
            universal disorder which would be involved in such a confla­ <lb/>
            gration than by showing that those things which by a law of <lb/>
            nature must exist together, are by this process separated from <lb/>
            their natural conjunction? And the separation has extended <lb/>
            to such a degree, that those who maintain this doctrine attri­ <lb/>
            bute eternal durability to the one and deny any existence at <lb/>
            all to the other.</p>
          <p>Again, there is this assertion made by some of those who <lb/>
            diligently employ themselves in investigating truth which <lb/>
            appears to me to be a sufficiently felicitous one ; if the world <lb/>
            is destroyed it will either be destroyed by some other efficient <lb/>
            cause, or by God; now there is certainly nothing else whatever <lb/>
            from which it can receive its destruction, for there is nothing <lb/>
            whatever which it does not surround and contain ; but that <lb/>
            which is surrounded and confined within something else is <lb/>
            manifestly inferior in power to that which surrounds and <lb/>
            confines it, by which it is therefore mastered; on the other <lb/>
            hand, to say that it is destroyed by God is the most impious of <lb/>
            all possible assertions; for God is the cause not of disorder, <lb/>
            and irregularity, and destruction, but of order, and beautiful <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            regularity, and life, and of every good thiug, as is confessed by <lb/>
            all those whose opinions are based on truth.</p>
          <p>XVII. But some of those persons who have fancied that <lb/>
            the world is everlasting, inventing a variety of new arguments, <lb/>
            employ also such a system of reasoning as this to establish <lb/>
            their point: they affirm that there are four principal manners <lb/>
            in which corruption is brought about, addition, taking away, <lb/>
            transposition, and alteration; accordingly, the number two is <lb/>
            by the addition of the unit corrupted so as to become the <lb/>
            number three, and no longer remains the number two; and <lb/>
            the number four by the taking away of the unit is corrupted <lb/>
            so as to become the number three ; again, by transposition the <lb/>
            letter Z becomes the letter H when the parallel lines which <lb/>
            were previously horizontal are placed perpendicularly II, <lb/>
            and when the line which did before pass upwards I, so as to <lb/>
            connect the two is now made horizontal, and still extended <lb/>
            between them so as to join them. And by alteration the word <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος</foreign>, wine, becomes <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὄξος</foreign>, vinegar.</p>
          <p>But of the manner of corruption thus mentioned there is <lb/>
            not one which is in the least degree whatever applicable to the <lb/>
            world, since otherwise what could we say? Could we affirm <lb/>
            that anything is added to the world so as to cause its destruc­ <lb/>
            tion ? But there is nothing whatever outside of the world <lb/>
            which, is not a portion of it as the whole, for everything is <lb/>
            surrounded, and contained, and mastered by it. Again, can <lb/>
            we say that anything is taken from the world so as to have <lb/>
            that effect ? In the first place that which would be taken <lb/>
            away would again be a world of smaller dimensions than the <lb/>
            existing one, and in the second place it is impossible that any <lb/>
            body could be separated from the composite fabric of the <lb/>
            whole world so as to be completely dispersed. Again, are we <lb/>
            to say that the constituent parts of the world are transposed ? <lb/>
            But at all events they remain in their original positions without <lb/>
            any change of place, for never at any time shall the whole <lb/>
            earth be raised up above the water, nor the water above the <lb/>
            air, nor the air above the fire. But those things which are <lb/>
            by nature heavy, namely the earth and the water, will have <lb/>
            the middle place, the earth supporting everything like a solid <lb/>
            foundation, and the water being above it; and the air and the <lb/>
            fire, which are by nature light, will have the higher position, <lb/>
            but not equally, for the air is the vehicle of the fire ; and that <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            which is carried by anything is of necessity above that which <lb/>
            carries it.</p>
          <p>Once more: we must not imagine that the world is de­ <lb/>
            stroyed by alteration, for the change of any elements is equi­ <lb/>
            pollent, and that which is equipollent is the cause of unvarying <lb/>
            steadiness, and of untroubled durability, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            neither seeks any advantage itself, and is not subject to the <lb/>
            inroads of other things which seek advantages at its expense ; <lb/>
            so that this retribution and compensation of these powers is <lb/>
            equalized by the rules of proportion, being the produce of <lb/>
            health and endless preservation, by all which considerations <lb/>
            the world is demonstrated to be eternal.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Theophrastus, moreover, says that those men who <lb/>
            attribute a beginning and destructibility to the world are <lb/>
            deceived by four particulars of the greatest importance, the <lb/>
            inequalities of the earth, the retreat of the sea, the dissolution <lb/>
            of each of the parts of the universe, and the destruction of <lb/>
            different terrestrial animals in their kinds; and he proceeds to <lb/>
            establish the first point thus: if the earth had never had any <lb/>
            beginning of its creation, then there would have been no <lb/>
            portion of it rising above the rest so as to be conspicuous, but <lb/>
            all the mountains would have been level, and all the pieces of <lb/>
            rising ground would have been even with the plain.</p>
          <p>For as there are such vast showers falling from heaven <lb/>
            throughout all ages, it would be natural that of any places <lb/>
            which were originally raised on high some would be broken <lb/>
            down and washed away by torrents, and others would subside <lb/>
            of their own accord and so become lowered, and that every <lb/>
            place everywhere would be smoothed ; but now, as things are, <lb/>
            the constant inequalities which exist, and the vast heights of <lb/>
            many mountains, reaching up even to the sky, are so many <lb/>
            proofs that the earth is not eternal.</p>
          <p>For otherwise, as I have said before, all the earth would <lb/>
            long since have been rendered level from one extremity to the <lb/>
            other by the vast rains which would have fallen from the <lb/>
            eternal commencement of time; for it is the character of the <lb/>
            nature of water, and especially of such as descends in a heavy <lb/>
            fall from lofty places, to push some things away by force, and <lb/>
            to cut out and hollow other places by its continual dropping. <lb/>
            and in this manner to operate on the hard, rugged, stony <lb/>
            ground not less than men digging. And again, the sea, as <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            they affirm, is already somewhat diminished, and for proof of <lb/>
            this fact we can appeal to the most celebrated islands, Rhodes <lb/>
            and Delos, for these were in ancient times invisible, being <lb/>
            overwhelmed by and sunk under the sea, but by lapse of time, <lb/>
            as the sea gradually diminished, they by slow degrees rose <lb/>
            above it and came into sight, as the histories which are <lb/>
            written concerning them record. And they used to call Delos <lb/>
            Anaphe, confirming the account here given by both names, <lb/>
            since when it appeared above the waters * it became evident,! <lb/>
            having been formerly invisible and unseen.</p>
          <p>And in addition to these arguments they adduce the facts <lb/>
            that many great and deep bays and gulfs of vast seas have <lb/>
            been dried up, and have become land, and have so turned out <lb/>
            no insignificant addition to the adjacent country when sown <lb/>
            and planted, and on that soil there is still left plenty of proof <lb/>
            of such spots having formerly been sea, in the pebbles, and <lb/>
            shells, and other things which are commonly washed up on <lb/>
            the sea-shore being found in them.</p>
          <p>But if the sea is gradually being diminished then the earth <lb/>
            also will be diminished; and in long revolutions of years every <lb/>
            one of the elements will be entirely consumed and destroyed; <lb/>
            and the whole air will be consumed, being diminished by little <lb/>
            and little ; and all things will be absorbed and dissolved into <lb/>
            the one substance of fire.</p>
          <p>And for the purpose of establishing the third alter­ <lb/>
            native of this question they use the following argument: <lb/>
            beyond all question that thing is destroyed all the parts of <lb/>
            which are liable to destruction; but all the parts of the world <lb/>
            are liable to destruction, therefore the world also is liable to <lb/>
            destruction.</p>
          <p>But we must now proceed to consider the question which <lb/>
            we postponed till the present time. What sort of a part of <lb/>
            the earth is that, that we may begin from this, whether it is <lb/>
            greater or less, that is not dissolved by time ? Do not <lb/>
            the very hardest and strongest stones become hard and de­ <lb/>
            cayed through the weakness of their conformation (and this <lb/>
            conformation is a sort of course of a highly strained spirit, a <lb/>
            bond not indissoluble, but only very difficult to unloose), in <note type="footnote"> * The Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναφανεῑσα</foreign>, from which '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αναφὴ</foreign>,) is derived, </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δήλη</foreign>, from which <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δῆλος</foreign> is derived. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            consequence of which they are broken up aud made fluid, so <lb/>
            that they are dissolved first of all into a thin dust, and after­ <lb/>
            wards are wholly wasted away and destroyed? Again, if the <lb/>
            water were never agitated by the winds, but were left immoye­ <lb/>
            able for ever, would it not from inaction and tranquillity <lb/>
            become dead ? at all events it is changed by such stagnation, and <lb/>
            becomes very foetid and foul-smelling, like an animal deprived <lb/>
            of life. And so also the corruptions of the air are plain to <lb/>
            everyone, for it is the nature of the atmosphere to become <lb/>
            sick and to decay, and, as one may say, in a manner to die ; <lb/>
            since what else is it which a man, who is not aiming at select­ <lb/>
            ing plausible language, but only at truth, would call a plague <lb/>
            except a death of the atmosphere, which diffuses its own <lb/>
            disease and suffering to the destructiou of everything which is <lb/>
            endowed with life ?</p>
          <p>And why need I speak at great length concerning fire ? for <lb/>
            if it is deprived of nourishment it is immediately extinguished.</p>
          <p>If then, each of the separate parts of the world awaits utter <lb/>
            destruction, it is plain that the world which is compounded of <lb/>
            these can not be itself exempt from destruction.</p>
          <p>We must now consider with accuracy the fourth and remain­ <lb/>
            ing argument. Thus they argue: if the world were eternal then <lb/>
            the animals also would be eternal, and much more the human <lb/>
            race, in proportion as that is more excellent than the other <lb/>
            animals ; but, on the contrary, those who take delight in inves­ <lb/>
            tigating the mysteries of nature consider that man has only <lb/>
            been created in the late ages of the world; for it is likely, or I <lb/>
            should rather say it is inevitably true, that the arts co-exist <lb/>
            with man, so as to be exactly co-eval with him, not only because <lb/>
            methodical proceedings are appropriate to a rational nature, <lb/>
            but also because it is not possible to live without them ; let us <lb/>
            therefore examine the dates of each of these, disregarding the <lb/>
            fables invented by the tragedians about the gods; but if man <lb/>
            is not eternal then neither is any other animal, so that then <lb/>
            neither are the places which receive them, the earth, or the <lb/>
            water, or the air; from all which considerations it is plain that <lb/>
            this world is liable to destruction.</p>
          <p>XIX. But it is necessary to encounter such quibbling <lb/>
            arguments as these, lest some persons of too little experience <lb/>
            should yield to and be led away by them; and we must begin <lb/>
            our refutation of them from the same point from which the <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            Sophists begin their deceit. They say, " There could no longer <lb/>
            be any inequalities existing on the earth, if the world were <lb/>
            eternal." Why not, my most excellent friends? For other <lb/>
            persons will come up and say that the natures of trees are in <lb/>
            no respect different from mountains; but just as they at <lb/>
            certain seasons lose their leaves, and again at certain seasons <lb/>
            recover their verdure again; (on which account there is admi­ <lb/>
            rable truth in those lines of the poet ;­ <lb/>
            "Like leaves on trees the race of man is found, <lb/>
            Now green in youth, now withering on the ground; <lb/>
            Another race the following spring supplies ; <lb/>
            They fall successive and successive rise.") * <lb/>
            And so in like manner some portions of the mountains are <lb/>
            broken off, and others grow in their stead : but after a long <lb/>
            lapse of time the additional growth becomes conspicuous, <lb/>
            because the trees having a more rapid nature display their <lb/>
            increase with great rapidity; but mountains have a slower <lb/>
            character, on which account it happens that the additions <lb/>
            which take place in their case are not perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward senses except after a long time.</p>
          <p>And these men appear to be ignorant of the manner in <lb/>
            which they are produced, since if they had not been, perhaps <lb/>
            they would have been silent out of shame ; but still there is <lb/>
            no reason why we should not teach them; but there is nothing <lb/>
            new in what is now said, neither are they our words but the <lb/>
            ancient sayings of wise men, by whom nothing which was <lb/>
            necessary for knowledge has been left uninvestigated; when <lb/>
            the fiery principle which is contained beneath, in the earth, is <lb/>
            thrust upwards by the natural power of fire, it proceeds to its <lb/>
            own appropriate place; and if it meets with any respite or <lb/>
            relaxation, though ever so slight, it draws up with it a large <lb/>
            portion of the earthy substance, as much as it can; and when <lb/>
            it has emerged from the earth it proceeds more slowly; but <lb/>
            the earthy substance being compelled to follow it for a long <lb/>
            time, being at last raised to an immense height, is contracted <lb/>
            at the top, and at last comes to end on a sharp point imitating <lb/>
            the general appearance of the flame of fire; for there arises <lb/>
            then a most violent contention between two things which are <lb/>
            natural adversaries, the lightest and the heaviest of things, <lb/>
            each of them pressing onwards to reach its own place, and <note type="footnote"> * Homer, II. vi. 147. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="207"/>
            each striving against the violent efforts of the other; accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the fire, which is drawing up the earth with it, is com­ <lb/>
            pelled to sink down by its descending power; and the earth <lb/>
            naturally inclining to the lowest point is nevertheless to a <lb/>
            certain degree made light, and lifted up by the upward ten­ <lb/>
            dencies of fire, and so is raised on high, and being at last <lb/>
            overpowered by the more influential power which lightens it is <lb/>
            thrust upwards towards the natural seat of fire, and established <lb/>
            on high.</p>
          <p>Why then need we wonder if the mountains are not entirely <lb/>
            washed away by the impetuosity of the rains, when so great <lb/>
            a power, which keeps them together, and by which they are <lb/>
            raised up, is very firmly and steadfastly connected with them ? <lb/>
            For if they were released from the bond which holds them <lb/>
            together, it would be natural for them to be entirely dissolved <lb/>
            and to be dispersed by the water; but since they are bound <lb/>
            together by this power of fire, they resist the impetuosity of <lb/>
            the rains more surely.</p>
          <p>XX. These things, then, may be said by us with respect <lb/>
            to the argument that the inequalities of the surface of the <lb/>
            earth are no proof of the world having been created and being <lb/>
            liable to destruction; but with respect to that argument which <lb/>
            was endeavoured to be established by the diminution of the <lb/>
            sea, we may reasonably adduce this statement in opposition to <lb/>
            it: " Do not look only at the islands which have risen up out <lb/>
            of the sea, nor at any portions of land which, having been for­ <lb/>
            merly buried by the waters, have in subsequent times become <lb/>
            dry land; for obstinate contention is very unfavourable to the <lb/>
            consideration of natural philosophy, which considers the search <lb/>
            after truth to be the chief object of rational desire; but look <lb/>
            rather at the contrary effects : consider how many districts on <lb/>
            the main-land, not only such as were near the coast, but even <lb/>
            such as were completely in-land, have been swallowed up by <lb/>
            the waters; and consider how great a portion of land has <lb/>
            become sea and is now sailed over by innumerable ships." <lb/>
            Are you ignorant of the celebrated account which is given of <lb/>
            that most sacred Sicilian strait, which in old times joined <lb/>
            Sicily to the continent of Italy? and where vast seas on each <lb/>
            side being excited by violent storms met together, coming <lb/>
            from opposite directions, the land between them was over­ <lb/>
            whelmed and broken away; from which circumstance the <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            city built in the neighbourhood was called Rhegium,* and <lb/>
            the result was quite different from what any one would have <lb/>
            expected; for the seas which had formerly been separated <lb/>
            now flowed together and were united in one expanse; and the <lb/>
            land which had previously united was now separated into two <lb/>
            portions by the strait which intersected it, in consequence of <lb/>
            which Sicily, which had previously formed a part of the main­ <lb/>
            land, was now compelled to be an island.</p>
          <p>XXI. And it is said that many other cities also have disap­ <lb/>
            peared, having been swallowed up by the sea which overwhelmed <lb/>
            them; since they speak of three in Peloponnesus­ <lb/>
            " Ægira and fair Bura's walls, <lb/>
            And Helica's lofty halls, <lb/>
            And many a once renowned town, <lb/>
            With wreck and seaweed overgrown," <lb/>
            as having been formerly prosperous, but now overwhelmed by <lb/>
            the violent influx of the sea. And the island of Atalantes <lb/>
            which was greater than Africa and Asia, as Plato says in the <lb/>
            Timæus, in one day and night was overwhelmed beneath the <lb/>
            sea in consequence of an extraordinary earthquake and inun­ <lb/>
            dation and suddenly disappeared, becoming sea, not indeed <lb/>
            navigable, but full of gulfs and eddies. Therefore that imagi­ <lb/>
            nary and fictitious diminution of the sea has no connection with <lb/>
            the destruction or durability of the world ; for in fact it ap­ <lb/>
            pears to recede indeed from some parts, but to rise higher in <lb/>
            others; and it would have been proper rather not to look at <lb/>
            only one of these results but at both together, and so to form <lb/>
            one's opinion, since in all the disputed questions which arise <lb/>
            in human life, a wise and honest judge will not deliver his <lb/>
            opinion before he has heard the arguments of the advocates on <lb/>
            both sides.</p>
          <p>XXII. And as for the third argument, it is convicted by <lb/>
            itself, as being derived only from an unsound system of ques­ <lb/>
            tioning proceeding from the assertions originally made; for in <lb/>
            truth it does not necessarily follow that a thing, all the parts <lb/>
            of which are liable to corruption, is likewise perishable itself; <lb/>
            but this is only inevitably true of that thing of which all <lb/>
            the parts are perishable when taken collectively and together <lb/>
            in the same place and at the same time, since in the case of a <lb/>
            person who has the tip of his finger cut off, he is not disabled <note type="footnote"> * '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ρήγιον</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ῥήγνυμι</foreign>, "to break." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            from living, but if he had the whole collection of all his parts­ <lb/>
            and limbs cut off at once, he would die immediately. There­ <lb/>
            fore in the same manner, if all the elements of the world <lb/>
            together were all to disappear at one and the same moment, <lb/>
            then it would be necessary to admit that the world was liable to <lb/>
            corruption and destruction; but if each of these elements <lb/>
            separately only changes its nature so as to assimilate to that of <lb/>
            its nature, it is then rendered immortal rather than destroyed, <lb/>
            according to the philosophical statement of the tragic poet- <lb/>
            Nought that has once existed dies, <lb/>
            Though often what has been combine <lb/>
            Before, we separated find, <lb/>
            Invested with another form." <lb/>
            For it is the greatest folly imaginable to estimate the antiquity <lb/>
            of the human race from the state of art; for if any one were to <lb/>
            follow the absurdity of such a system of reasoning as this, he <lb/>
            will prove the world to be very young indeed, and to have been <lb/>
            made scarcely a thousand years, since all those men whom we <lb/>
            have heard of traditionally as the discoverers in different <lb/>
            branches of science do not go back to a greater number of <lb/>
            years than that which I have mentioned.</p>
          <p>But if we must speak of the arts as co-eval with the race of <lb/>
            mankind, then we must speak, drawing our arguments from <lb/>
            natural history, and not inconsiderately or carelessly. And <lb/>
            what is this history? The destruction of the things on the <lb/>
            earth, not all together, but of the greatest number of them, is <lb/>
            attributed to two principal causes, the indescribable violence <lb/>
            and power of fire and water. And they say that each of these <lb/>
            elements attacks them in its turn, after very long periods of <lb/>
            revolving years. When, therefore, a conflagration seizes upon <lb/>
            things, a stream of ethereal fire being poured down from above <lb/>
            is frequently diffused over them, overrunning many districts of <lb/>
            the habitable world; and when a deluge draws down the whole <lb/>
            of the rainy nature of water, the regular rivers and torrents <lb/>
            overflowing, and not only that, but even far exceeding the <lb/>
            ordinary measure of a common flood.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, when the greater part of mankind is destroyed <lb/>
            in the manners above mentioned, besides an infinity of other <lb/>
            ways of less power and importance, it follows of necessity that <lb/>
            the arts also must fail, for it cannot be possible to discuss <lb/>
            science by itself without some one to reduce it to method and <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> P </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            practice. But when those common pestilences relax their <lb/>
            fury, and when the human race begins again to recover vigour <lb/>
            and to flourish, descending from those who have not been <lb/>
            previously destroyed by the evils which pressed upon them, <lb/>
            then the arts also begin again to exist, not indeed as they were <lb/>
            at first, but in thinner numbers from the diminution of the <lb/>
            numbers of those who practise them.</p>
          <p>I have now then set forth to the best of my ability what I <lb/>
            have been able to learn or to understand concerning the <lb/>
            indestructibility of the world.</p>

          <p>BUT that you may not think that I am here arguing in a <lb/>
            sophistical manner, I will produce a man who is a Hebrew as <lb/>
            the interpreter for you of the meaning of the scripture; a <lb/>
            man who inherited from his father a most accurate knowledge <lb/>
            of his national customs and laws, and who had learnt the <lb/>
            doctrines contained in them from learned teachers; for such a <lb/>
            man was Philo. Listen then, to him, and hear how he inter­ <lb/>
            prets the words of God.</p>
          <p>Why, then, does he use the expression, " In the image of <lb/>
            God I made man,"* as if he were speaking of that of some <lb/>
            other God, and not of having made him in the likeness of him­ <lb/>
            self? This expression is used with great beauty and wisdom. <lb/>
            For it was impossible that anything mortal should be made in <lb/>
            the likeness of the most high God the Father of the universe; <lb/>
            but it could only be made in the likeness of the second God, <lb/>
            who is the Word of the other; for it was fitting that the <lb/>
            rational type in the soul of man should receive the impression <lb/>
            of the Word of God, since the God below the Word is superior <lb/>
            to all and every rational nature; and it is not lawful for any <lb/>
            created thing to be made like the God who is above reason, <lb/>
            and who is endowed with a most excellent and special form ap­ <lb/>
            propriated to himself alone. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 27. </note> <pb n="211"/>
            </p>
          <p>This is what I wish to quote from the first book of the ques­ <lb/>
            tions and answers of Philo.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">From the same work, c. 21.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>And the Hebrew Philo, in his treatise on Providence, speaks <lb/>
            in this way concerning matter.</p>
          <p>But concerning the quantity of the essence, if indeed it <lb/>
            really has any existence, we must also speak. God took care <lb/>
            at the creation of the world that there should be an ample and <lb/>
            most sufficient supply of matter, so exact that nothing might <lb/>
            be wanting and nothing superfluous. For it would have been <lb/>
            absurd in the case of particular artisans, for them, when they are <lb/>
            occupied in making anything, and especially anything of much <lb/>
            value, to calculate the exact quantity of materials which they re­ <lb/>
            quire; but for that being who is the original inventor of numbers <lb/>
            and measures, and the qualities which exist and are found in <lb/>
            them, to omit to take care to have just what was proper. I <lb/>
            will speak now with all freedom, and say that the world had <lb/>
            need for its fabrication of some precise quantity of materials, <lb/>
            neither more nor less ; since otherwise it would not have been <lb/>
            perfect, nor complete in all its parts, being thoroughly well <lb/>
            made, nor would it have been made perfect of a perfect <lb/>
            essence.</p>
          <p>For it is an indispensable part of a workman who is <lb/>
            thoroughly well skilled in his art, before he begins making <lb/>
            any thing, to see that his materials are exactly sufficient; <lb/>
            therefore a man, even if he were most eminently skilled in the <lb/>
            knowledge of other things, still if he were not able altogether <lb/>
            to avoid error, which is so natural to mortals, would be very <lb/>
            likely to be deceived in respect of the quantity of materials <lb/>
            which he required when he was about to proceed to the exer­ <lb/>
            cise of art; sometimes adding to it as too little, and sometimes <lb/>
            taking away from it as too much. But that Being who is, as it <lb/>
            were, a kind of fountain of all knowledge, was not likely to sup­ <lb/>
            ply anything in deficient or in superfluous quantities, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he employs measures elaborated in a most wonderful man­ <lb/>
            ner, so as to display perfect accuracy, and all of the most <lb/>
            praiseworthy character. But he who is inclined to talk <lb/>
            nonsense, at random, will easily do it, looking upon the <lb/>
            different works of all artisans as causes, and as having been <lb/>
            made in a more excellent manner, either by the addition or by <note type="footnote"> P 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            the subtraction of some material or other. But it is the <lb/>
            peculiar occupation of sophistry to quibble and cavil; while it is <lb/>
            the task of wisdom to investigate accurately everything that <lb/>
            exists in nature.</p>
          <p>And this is the way in which Philo speaks on this subject.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">From the eighth book of the same author, c. 5.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>And first of all I will adduce what Philo says respecting <lb/>
            the journey of the Jews into Egypt, of which he has given an <lb/>
            account, following that which is given by Moses in the first <lb/>
            book of the Pentateuch, to which he has affixed the superscrip­ <lb/>
            tion, " hypothetically; " where, arguing in behalf of the <lb/>
            Jews as if he were addressing himself to their accusers, he <lb/>
            speaks in the following manner, affirming,-</p>
          <p>That their ancient ancestor, the original founder of their <lb/>
            race, was a Chaldiean; and that this people emigrated from <lb/>
            Egypt, after having in former times left its abode in Syria, <lb/>
            being very numerous and consisting of countless myriads of <lb/>
            people; and that when the land was no longer able to contain <lb/>
            them, and moreover when a high spirit began to show itself <lb/>
            in the dispositions of their young men, and when, besides this, <lb/>
            God himself by visions and dreams began to show them that <lb/>
            he willed that they should depart, and when, as the Deity <lb/>
            brought it about, nothing was less an object of desire to them <lb/>
            than their ancient native land; on that account this ancestor <lb/>
            of theirs departed and journeyed into Egypt, whether in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of some express determination of God, or whether it <lb/>
            was in consequence of some prophetic instinct of his own; so <lb/>
            that from that time to the present the nation has had an <lb/>
            existence and a durability, and has become so exceedingly <lb/>
            populous, as it is at this moment.</p>
          <p>And then, after a few more sentences, he says,-</p>
          <p>And they were led in this journey and emigration of theirs <lb/>
            by a man who, if you will have it so, was in no respect superior <lb/>
            to the generality of his fellow countrymen, so incessantly did <lb/>
            they reproach him as a trickster and one who deceived them <lb/>
            with words. An admirable amount and kind of trickery and <lb/>
            deceit no doubt it was, by which he not only completely saved <lb/>
            the whole people which was oppressed by want of water and <lb/>
            hunger, and by ignorance of the way, and in a complete state <lb/>
            of destitution of all things, and led them forward as if in all <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            prosperity, and conducted them through all the nations lying <lb/>
            around, and kept them without any quarrelling with one another, <lb/>
            and in a state of complete subordination and obedience to him­ <lb/>
            self. And this too, not for a short time, but for a period of <lb/>
            such length, that it is not likely that even a single family would <lb/>
            continue in perfect unanimity and prosperity for such a time; <lb/>
            for no thirst, no hunger, no decay of body, no fear of the <lb/>
            future, no ignorance of what was to befall them, ever excited <lb/>
            that deceived people, who were being led, as some will have it, <lb/>
            to their destruction, to rise against him who was deceiving them. <lb/>
            Yet what would you have us say? That he had such excessive <lb/>
            art, or such great eloquence of speech, or such shrewdness, <lb/>
            that he could triumph over so many difficulties of such a <lb/>
            nature, which seemed likely to lead to the destruction of them <lb/>
            all ? Surely you must confess, either that the natures of the <lb/>
            men under him were not utterly ignorant or obstinate, but <lb/>
            were obedient and not inclined to neglect a prudent care of <lb/>
            the future ; or else that they were as wicked and perverse as <lb/>
            possible, but that God softened their obstinacy, and was, as it <lb/>
            were, a leader to them in respect both of the present and of <lb/>
            the future.</p>
          <p>For that of these alternatives which appears to you to be the <lb/>
            truest of the two, appears equally to contribute to the praise, <lb/>
            and honour, and admiration of the whole nation.</p>
          <p>These things, then, are what I have to say about this <lb/>
            exodus. But when they came into this land, how they were <lb/>
            settled here, and how they got possession of the country, they <lb/>
            show in their sacred records. And I moreover do not think it <lb/>
            necessary to describe it as by way of history, but rather to <lb/>
            enter into some speculations concerning them as to what was <lb/>
            their natural and likely course. For which of these two alterna­ <lb/>
            tives will you embrace ? That while they were still very <lb/>
            numerous, although at last they were evilly afflicted, still, while <lb/>
            they were powerful and had arms in their hands, they took the <lb/>
            country by force, fighting with and defeating both the Syrians <lb/>
            and Phoenicians who met them in that their laud ? Or shall <lb/>
            we suppose that they were unwarlike, and destitute of manly <lb/>
            courage, and altogether deficient in point of numbers, and <lb/>
            destitute of any supplies for war; but that they met with respect­ <lb/>
            ful treatment from those nations, and obtained their land from <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            them, who willingly surrendered it to them ? and that then <lb/>
            immediately, or at no distant period, they built a temple, and <lb/>
            did everything else which has any bearing on religion and <lb/>
            piety ?</p>
          <p>For these circumstances, as it seems, would prove them to <lb/>
            have been a God-loving people, and beloved by God, and con­ <lb/>
            fessed to be such even by their enemies; for those people into <lb/>
            whose territories they had suddenly come, as if to deprive them <lb/>
            of them, were of necessity their enemies. And if they met <lb/>
            with respectful treatment and honour from them, how can we <lb/>
            deny that they surpassed all other men in good fortune ?</p>
          <p>And what shall we say after this in the second place, or in <lb/>
            the third place? Shall we speak of their admirable code of <lb/>
            laws, of their obedience, or of their devotion, and justice, and <lb/>
            holiness, and piety ? But in truth they looked upon that man, <lb/>
            whoever he was, who gave them these laws, with such excessive <lb/>
            admiration and veneration, that whatever he approved of they <lb/>
            immediately thought best also. Therefore, whether he spoke, <lb/>
            being influenced by his own reason, or because he was <lb/>
            inspired by the Deity, they referred every word of his to God. <lb/>
            And though many years have passed, I cannot tell the exact <lb/>
            number, but more than two thousand, still they have never <lb/>
            altered one word of what was written by him, but would rather <lb/>
            endure to die ten thousand times than to do any thing in <lb/>
            opposition to his laws and to the customs which he esta­ <lb/>
            blished.</p>
          <p>After Philo has said this, he proceeds to give an abridgment <lb/>
            of the constitution established in the nation of the Jews by the <lb/>
            laws of Moses, speaking thus :-</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">From the same book, c. 7</title>
          </ab>
          <p>Now, is there anything among that people resembling these <lb/>
            circumstances, anything which appears to be of a mild and <lb/>
            gentle character, and which admits of invocations of justice, <lb/>
            and pleas, and delays, and of assessments of damages, and on <lb/>
            the other hand of counter assessments? Not a word, but <lb/>
            every thing is simple, plain, and straightforward. If you <lb/>
            indulge in illicit connexions, if you commit adultery, if you do <lb/>
            violence to a child (for do not speak of doing so to a boy, but <lb/>
            even to a female child); and in like manner, if you prostitute <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            yourself, if you suffer any thing disgraceful contrary to what <lb/>
            becomes your age, or appear to do so, or are about to do so, <lb/>
            death is the penalty for such wickedness.</p>
          <p>Again, if you behave with insult towards a slave, or towards <lb/>
            a free person, if you confine such an one in bonds, if you lead <lb/>
            him away and sell him, if you steal any thing, whether <lb/>
            common or sacred, if you commit acts of impiety, not only by <lb/>
            your deeds but even by any chance word, I will not venture <lb/>
            to say against God himself (may God be merciful to us, and <lb/>
            of the same opinion about these matters), but against your <lb/>
            father, or your mother, or your benefactor, death is equally the <lb/>
            penalty. And that too, not a common, or ordinary, or natural <lb/>
            death; but he who has merely uttered a single impious word <lb/>
            must be stoned, as having committed no inferior impiety.</p>
          <p>He also gives many other injunctions, such as these, <lb/>
            that wives shall serve their husbands, not indeed in any par­ <lb/>
            ticular so as to be insulted by them, but in the spirit of <lb/>
            reasonable obedience in all things; that parents shall govern <lb/>
            their children for their preservation and benefit; that every <lb/>
            one shall be the lord of his own possessions, provided he has <lb/>
            not dedicated them to God, nor spoken of God as their owner; <lb/>
            but if he has vowed them only by a single word, then it is not <lb/>
            lawful for him to lay hands upon or to touch them, but he must <lb/>
            at once separate himself from them all. May I never be <lb/>
            guilty of plundering the things which belong to God, or of <lb/>
            stealing what has been offered and dedicated to him by others. <lb/>
            And even, as I have said before, if a single word to that effect <lb/>
            has unintentionally fallen from a man, he must, instead of <lb/>
            taking away from what is already dedicated, add some offering <lb/>
            of his own ; for if he has said the word, he, by so speaking, <lb/>
            deprives himself of every thing. But if he repents, or wishes <lb/>
            to recall and amend what he has said, he shall be deprived also <lb/>
            of his very life. And the same principle extends to other <lb/>
            things, of which he is the owner.</p>
          <p>If a man by any words dedicates that which is requisite to <lb/>
            support a wife, she shall be sacred and entitled to receive the <lb/>
            support. If a father makes such a promise to his son, or a <lb/>
            master to his servant, the rule is the same. And the way in <lb/>
            which a man may be released from any promise or vow which <lb/>
            he has made in such a manner can only be in the most perfect <lb/>
            and complete way, when the high priest discharges him from <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            it; for he is the person entitled to receive it in due subordi­ <lb/>
            nation to God. And the next way is that which consists in <lb/>
            propitiating the mercy of God in behalf of those who are the <lb/>
            more immediate owners of the thing vowed, so that he may <lb/>
            not accept of what is thus dedicated, since it is necessary to <lb/>
            them. There are, besides these rules, ten thousand other <lb/>
            precepts, which refer to the unwritten customs and ordinances <lb/>
            of the nation.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it is ordained in the laws themselves that no one <lb/>
            shall do to his neighbour what he would be unwilling to have <lb/>
            done to himself.</p>
          <p>That a man shall not take up what he has not put down, <lb/>
            neither out of a garden, nor out of a wine-press, nor out of a <lb/>
            threshing-floor; and that absolutely no one shall take anything, <lb/>
            whether it be great or small, out of a heap. That no one shall <lb/>
            refuse fire to one who begs it of him.</p>
          <p>That no one shall cut off a stream of water, but that every­ <lb/>
            one shall contribute food to beggars and cripples, and that <lb/>
            such shall have favour with God. That no one shall keep <lb/>
            any one from performing funeral honours to the dead, but <lb/>
            shall even throw upon them so much earth as is sufficient to <lb/>
            protect them from impiety: that no one shall violate or move, <lb/>
            in any manner or degree whatever, the graves, or tombs, or <lb/>
            memorials of those who are dead. That no one shall add <lb/>
            bonds, or any evil, or heap any additional suffering on him <lb/>
            who is in trouble. That no one shall eradicate the generative <lb/>
            powers of a man. That no one shall cause the offspring of <lb/>
            women to be abortive by means of miscarriage, or by any other <lb/>
            contrivance. That no one shall treat animals, in any respect, <lb/>
            in a manner contrary to the injunctions imposed, whether by <lb/>
            God or by a lawgiver.</p>
          <p>That no one shall cause his seed to disappear. That no one <lb/>
            shall enslave his offspring. That no one shall apply a false <lb/>
            balance, or an inadequate measure, or bad money. That no one <lb/>
            shall tell the secrets of his friends in a foreign land. Where, <lb/>
            in God'a name, are these yokes of oxen of ours gone ? And <lb/>
            look also at other commandments besides these. It is or­ <lb/>
            dained, that no one shall fix the residence of the parents apart <lb/>
            from that of the children, not even if they are prisoners of <lb/>
            war; nor that of a wife from that of her husband, even though <lb/>
            a man may be her master, having purchased her lawfully.</p><pb n="217"/>
            
          <p>These commandments now are of a more solemn and import­ <lb/>
            ant character, but there are others of apparently a trivial and <lb/>
            ordinary kind. It is not. lawful, says the lawgiver, to strip a <lb/>
            nest wholly of its young; it is not lawful to reject the sup­ <lb/>
            plication of animals of any kind whatever, which flee to you <lb/>
            for refuge, not even if any of them are very insignificant. You <lb/>
            may say, perhaps, that these things are of no consequence <lb/>
            whatever, but still, at least, the law which speaks of these par­ <lb/>
            ticulars is of importance, and deserving of all imaginable care <lb/>
            and attention; and the declarations are important, and so are <lb/>
            the curses which threaten those who violate these laws with <lb/>
            destruction; and God looks over all such matters, and is an <lb/>
            avenger and punisher on every occasion and in every place.</p>
          <p>And then after a few more sentences he adds,-</p>
          <p>And if it should happen that during a whole day, or I <lb/>
            should rather say, not one day only but many, and those too <lb/>
            not coming immediately one after another, but with intervals <lb/>
            between them, even intervals of a week at a time, the custom, <lb/>
            as is always natural, which is drawn from ordinary days pre­ <lb/>
            vails. Do you not wonder, that not a single one of all these <lb/>
            commandments has been violated ? Is not this a mark of great <lb/>
            temperance and self-restraint, derived to them from practice <lb/>
            alone, so that they act towards one another with perfect <lb/>
            equality, and are able to derive strength from those actions if <lb/>
            it be necessary ? Surely not so; but the lawgiver thought <lb/>
            that it ought to be derived from some great and admirable <lb/>
            circumstance, that they should not only be competent to do <lb/>
            other things in the same manner, but should also be imbued <lb/>
            with a thorough knowledge of their national laws and cus­ <lb/>
            toms.</p>
          <p>What then did he do on this sabbath day ? he commanded <lb/>
            all the people to assemble together in the same place, and <lb/>
            sitting down with one another, to listen to the laws with order <lb/>
            and reverence, in order that no one should be ignorant of any­ <lb/>
            thing that is contained in them; and, in fact, they do con­ <lb/>
            stantly assemble together, and they do sit down one with <lb/>
            another, the multitude in general in silence, except when it is <lb/>
            customary to say any words of good omen, by way of assent to <lb/>
            what is being read. And then some priest who is present, or <lb/>
            some one of the elders, reads the sacred laws to them, and <lb/>
            inteprets each of them separately till eventide; and then <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            when separate they depart, having gained some skill in the <lb/>
            sacred laws, and having made great advances towards piety.</p>
          <p>Do not these objects appear to you to be of greater im­ <lb/>
            portance than any other pursuit can possibly be ? Therefore <lb/>
            they do not go to interpreters of laws to learn what they ought <lb/>
            to do; and even without asking, they are in no ignorance <lb/>
            respecting the laws, so as to be likely, through following their <lb/>
            own inclinations, to do wrong; but if you violate or alter any <lb/>
            one of their laws, or if you ask any one of them about their <lb/>
            national laws or customs, they can all tell you at once, without <lb/>
            any difficulty; and the husband appears to be a master, en­ <lb/>
            dowed with sufficient authority to explain these laws to his <lb/>
            wife, a father to teach them to his children, and a master to <lb/>
            his servants.</p>
          <p>And again, it is easy to speak in the same manner with <lb/>
            respect to the seventh year, though, perhaps, one is not to say <lb/>
            exactly the same things, for they do not abstain from all work <lb/>
            as they do on the sabbath days, only they leave their land <lb/>
            fallow till the next year, in order that so it may become pro. <lb/>
            ductive ; for they think that thus it becomes much better after <lb/>
            having had this rest, and then that it may be cultivated again, <lb/>
            and not be dried up and exhausted by the uninterrupted con­ <lb/>
            tinuance of cultivation ; and you may see that a similar prac­ <lb/>
            tice conduces to strength of body, for not only do intervals of <lb/>
            relaxation contribute to health, but you may see too that phy­ <lb/>
            sicians also enjoin a degree of rest at times from work; for <lb/>
            what is incessant, and uninterrupted, and always the same, is <lb/>
            likely to be injurious, especially in the case of hard work, the <lb/>
            cultivation of the land.</p>
          <p>And a proof of this is, that if any one were to recommend <lb/>
            the people to cultivate the land itself much more, and to add <lb/>
            this seventh year also, and should promise them that the usual <lb/>
            crops of fruit should reward their labours, they still would not <lb/>
            adopt his advice, for they think that they are not alone entitled <lb/>
            to rest from their labours, and yet even if they were to do so, <lb/>
            it would be nothing strange; but they think that their land <lb/>
            also deserves a certain degree of rest and exemption, in order <lb/>
            again to receive a fresh beginning of care and cultivation; <lb/>
            since, in God's name, what could hinder them from letting it <lb/>
            out during the year of jubilee thus proposed, and then receiv­ <lb/>
            ing its annual produce once a year from those who rented and <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            cultivated it ? But as 1 said before, they will not admit of any <lb/>
            such expedient in any manner or degree whatever, out of care, <lb/>
            as it seems to me, for the welfare of the land; and this is <lb/>
            truly a very great proof of their humanity and moderation.</p>
          <p>For, since they themselves rest from their labours during <lb/>
            that year, they think that it is not right either to collect the <lb/>
            fruits or crops which are produced, nor to lay up any thing <lb/>
            which has not accrued to them from their own labours; but, as <lb/>
            if God provided for them while the land is thus enjoying rest <lb/>
            and regulating itself according to its will, they think that any <lb/>
            one who chooses or who is in want, any traveller or stranger, <lb/>
            may gather the fruit that year with impunity.</p>
          <p>However, this is enough to say to you on these matters; for, <lb/>
            as to the fact of this law existing among them with regard to <lb/>
            the seventh day and seventh year, you will not inquire of me, <lb/>
            as you have perhaps heard it often from many persons, both <lb/>
            physicians,, and investigators of natural history, and philo­ <lb/>
            sophers, who discuss this law about the seventh year, as to <lb/>
            the effect which it has on the nature of the universe, and <lb/>
            especially on the nature of man.</p>
          <p>This is what he says about the seventh day.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">From the same book, c. 8.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>I shall be contented with the testimony of Philo on the <lb/>
            present occasion, which he has given about the matter which I <lb/>
            am here explaining in many passages of his treatises. And <lb/>
            now do you take that work which he has written in defence of <lb/>
            the Jewish nation, and read the following sentences in it.</p>
          <p>But our lawgiver trained an innumerable body of his <lb/>
            pupils to partake in those things, who are called Essenes. <lb/>
            being, as I imagine, honoured with this appellation because of <lb/>
            their exceeding holiness.</p>
          <p>And they dwell in many cities of Judaea, and in many <lb/>
            villages, and in great and populous communities. And this <lb/>
            sect of them is not an hereditary or family connexion; for <lb/>
            family ties are not spoken of with reference to acts voluntarily <lb/>
            performed ; but it is adopted because of their admiration for <lb/>
            virtue and love of gentleness and humanity. At all events, <lb/>
            there are no children among the Essenes, no, nor any youths or <lb/>
            persons only just entering upon manhood; since the dispositions <lb/>
            of all such persons are unstable and liable to change, from the <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            imperfections incident to their age, but they are all full-grown <lb/>
            men, and even already declining towards old age, such as are <lb/>
            no longer carried away by the impetuosity of their bodily pas­ <lb/>
            sions, and are not under the influence of the appetites, but <lb/>
            such as enjoy a genuine freedom, the only true and real <lb/>
            liberty. And a proof of this is to be found in their life of <lb/>
            perfect freedom ; no one among them ventures at all to acquire <lb/>
            any property whatever of his own, neither house, nor slave, nor <lb/>
            farm, nor flocks and herds, nor any thing of any sort which <lb/>
            can be looked upon as the fountain or provision of riches ; but <lb/>
            they bring them together into the middle as a common stock, <lb/>
            and enjoy one common general benefit from it all.</p>
          <p>And they all dwell in the same place, making clubs, and <lb/>
            societies, and combinations, and unions with one another, and <lb/>
            doing every thing throughout their whole lives with reference <lb/>
            to the general advantage; but the different members of this <lb/>
            body have different employments in which they occupy them­ <lb/>
            selves, and labour without hesitation and without cessation, <lb/>
            making no mention of either cold, or heat, or any changes of <lb/>
            weather or temperature as an excuse for desisting from their <lb/>
            tasks. But before the sun rises they betake themselves to <lb/>
            their daily work, and they do not quit it till some time after it <lb/>
            has set, when they return home rejoicing no less than those <lb/>
            who have been exercising themselves in gymnastic contests ; for <lb/>
            they imagine that whatever they devote themselves to as a <lb/>
            practice is a sort of gymnastic exercise of more advantage to <lb/>
            life, and more pleasant both to soul and body, and of more <lb/>
            enduring benefit and equability, than mere athletic labours, <lb/>
            inasmuch as such toil does not cease to be practised with <lb/>
            delight when the age of vigour of body is passed; for there <lb/>
            are some of them who are devoted to the practice of agricul­ <lb/>
            ture, being skilful in such things as pertain to the sowing and <lb/>
            cultivation of lands; others again are shepherds, or cowherds, <lb/>
            and experienced in the management of every kind of animal ; <lb/>
            some are cunning in what relates to swarms of bees; others <lb/>
            again are artisans and handicraftsmen, in order to guard against <lb/>
            suffering from the want of anything of which there is at times <lb/>
            an actual need ; and these men omit and delay nothing, which <lb/>
            is requisite for the innocent supply of the necessaries of life.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, each of these men, who differ so widely in their <lb/>
            respective employments, when they have received their wages <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            give them up to one person who is appointed as the universal <lb/>
            steward and general manager ; and he, when he has received <lb/>
            the money, immediately goes and purchases what is necessary <lb/>
            and furnishes them with food in abundance, and all other <lb/>
            things of which the life of mankind stands in need. And those <lb/>
            who live together and eat at the same table are day after day <lb/>
            contented with the same things, being lovers of frugality and <lb/>
            moderation, and averse to all sumptuousness and extravagance <lb/>
            as a disease of both mind and body. And not only are their <lb/>
            tables in common but also their dress; for in the winter there <lb/>
            are thick cloaks found, and in the summer light cheap mantles, <lb/>
            so that whoever wants one is at liberty without restraint to go <lb/>
            and take whichever kind he chooses ; since what belongs to <lb/>
            one belongs to all, and on the other hand whatever belongs to <lb/>
            the whole body belongs to each individual.</p>
          <p>And again, if any one of them is sick he is cured from the <lb/>
            common resources, being attended to by the general care and <lb/>
            anxiety of the whole body. Accordingly the old men, even if <lb/>
            they happen to be childless, as if they were not only the fathers <lb/>
            of many children but were even also particularly happy in an <lb/>
            affectionate offspring, are accustomed to end their lives in a <lb/>
            most happy and prosperous and carefully attended old age, <lb/>
            being looked upon by such a number of people as worthy of so <lb/>
            much honour and provident regard that they think themselves <lb/>
            bound to care for them even more from inclination than from <lb/>
            any tie of natural affection.</p>
          <p>Again, perceiving with more than ordinary acuteness and <lb/>
            accuracy, what is alone or at least above all other things cal­ <lb/>
            culated to dissolve such associations, they repudiate marriage ; <lb/>
            and at the same time they practise continence in an eminent <lb/>
            degree ; for no one of the Essenes ever marries a wife, because <lb/>
            woman is a selfish creature and one addicted to jealousy in an <lb/>
            immoderate degree, and terribly calculated to agitate and <lb/>
            overturn the natural inclinations of a man, and to mislead him <lb/>
            by her continual tricks; for as she is always studying deceitful <lb/>
            speeches and all other kinds of hypocrisy, like an actress on <lb/>
            the stage, when she is alluring the eyes and ears of her <lb/>
            husband, she proceeds to cajole his predominant mind after <lb/>
            the servants have been deceived.</p>
          <p>And again, if there are children she becomes full of pride <lb/>
            and all kinds/of license in her speech, and all the obscure <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            sayings which she previously meditated in irony in a disguised <lb/>
            manner she now begins to utter with audacious confidence ; <lb/>
            and becoming utterly shameless she proceeds to acts of vio­ <lb/>
            lence, and does numbers of actions of which every one is hostile <lb/>
            to such associations; for the man who is bound under the <lb/>
            influence of the charms of a woman, or of children, by the <lb/>
            necessary ties of nature, being overwhelmed by the impulses <lb/>
            of affection, is no longer the same person towards others, but is <lb/>
            entirely changed, having, without being aware of it, become a <lb/>
            slave instead of a free man.</p>
          <p>This now is the enviable system of life of these Essenes, <lb/>
            so that not only private individuals but even mighty kings, <lb/>
            admiring the men, venerate their sect, and increase their <lb/>
            dignity and majesty in a still higher degree by their approba­ <lb/>
            tion and by the honours which they confer on them.</p>

          <p>These things then are what may be said on the subject of <lb/>
            the world having been created. And the same man also says a <lb/>
            great number of very novel and bold things in his treatise on <lb/>
            Providence, on the subject of the universe being governed by <lb/>
            prudence; first of all putting forward the propositions of the <lb/>
            atheists, and then proceeding to reply to each of them in <lb/>
            regular order. And I will now proceed to extract some of the <lb/>
            arguments which he adduces, even though they may appear <lb/>
            somewhat prolix, because they are nevertheless necessary and <lb/>
            important, abridging indeed the greater portion of them. Now <lb/>
            he conducts his argument in this way; these are his words.</p>
          <p>Do you say then that there is providence in such a vast <lb/>
            confusion and disorder of affairs ? For, in fact, which of the <lb/>
            circumstances and occurrences of human life is regulated by <lb/>
            any principle of order ? which of them is not full of all kinds <lb/>
            of irregularity and destruction ? Are you the only person who <lb/>
            is ignorant that blessings in complete abundance are heaped <lb/>
            upon the most wicked and worthless of mankind ? such, for <lb/>
            instance, as wealth, a high reputation, honour in the eyes of <lb/>
            the multitude, authority ? moreover, health, a good condition of <lb/>
            the outward senses, beauty, strength, and unimpeded enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of all good things, by means of an abundance of supplies <lb/>
            and resources and preparations of every kind, and in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of the peaceful good fortune and good condition of the <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            body? But all the lovers and practisers of wisdom and <lb/>
            prudence, and every kind of virtue, everyone of them I may <lb/>
            almost say, are poor, unknown, inglorious, and in a mean con­ <lb/>
            dition.</p>
          <p>Having said thus much with respect to the outward circum­ <lb/>
            stances of, and a vast number of other things affecting, these <lb/>
            men, he then immediately proceeds to refute the objections <lb/>
            of his adversaries by the following arguments.</p>
          <p>God is not a tyrant who practises cruelty and violence and <lb/>
            all the other acts of insolent authority like an inexorable <lb/>
            master, but he is rather a sovereign invested with a humane <lb/>
            and lawful authority, and as such he governs all the heaven <lb/>
            and the whole world in accordance with justice. And there is <lb/>
            no form of address with which a king can more appropriately <lb/>
            be saluted than the name of father ; for what, in human rela­ <lb/>
            tionships, parents are to their children, that also sovereigns are <lb/>
            to their states, and God towards the world, having adapted <lb/>
            these two most beautiful things by the unchangeable laws <lb/>
            of nature, by an indissoluble union, namely the authority of <lb/>
            the leader with the anxious care of a relation; for as parents <lb/>
            are not wholly indifferent to even ill-behaved children, but, <lb/>
            having compassion on their unfortunate dispositions, they are <lb/>
            careful and anxious for their welfare, looking upon it as the <lb/>
            act of relentless and. irreconcileable enemies to insult and <lb/>
            increase their misfortunes, but as the part of friends and rela. <lb/>
            tions to lighten their disasters: and indeed in the excess of <lb/>
            their liberality they even give more to such children than to <lb/>
            those who have always been well conducted, knowing well that <lb/>
            to these last their own moderation is at all times an abundant <lb/>
            resource and means of riches, but that the others have no <lb/>
            other hope except in their parents, and that if they are disap­ <lb/>
            pointed in that they will be destitute of even the necessaries <lb/>
            of life.</p>
          <p>So in the same manner, God, who is the father of all ra­ <lb/>
            tional understanding, takes care of all those beings who are <lb/>
            endowed with reason, and exercises a providential power for <lb/>
            the protection even of those who are living in a blameable <lb/>
            manner, giving them at the same time opportunity of correct­ <lb/>
            ing their errors, and nevertheless not violating the dictates of <lb/>
            his own merciful nature, of which virtue and humanity are the <lb/>
            regular attendants, being willing to have their dwelling in the <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            God-created world ; this one argument now, do thou, 0 my soul, <lb/>
            take to thyself, and store up within thyself as a sacred deposit, <lb/>
            and this other also as consistent with and in perfect harmony <lb/>
            with it. Do not ever be so deceived and wander from the truth <lb/>
            to such a degree as to think any wicked man happy, even <lb/>
            though he may be richer than Crcesus, and more sharp-sighted <lb/>
            than Lynceus, and more powerful than Milo of Crotena, and <lb/>
            more beautiful than Ganymede, <lb/>
            “Whom the immortal gods, for beauty's sake, <lb/>
            Did raise up from the vile earth to heaven, <lb/>
            To be the cup-bearer of mighty Jove.” *</p>
          <p>Accordingly, such a man, having shown his own dæmon, I <lb/>
            mean to say his own mind, to be the slave of ten thousand <lb/>
            thousand different masters, such as love, appetite, pleasure, <lb/>
            fear, pain, folly, intemperance, cowardice, injustice, he can <lb/>
            never possibly be happy, even if the multitude, being utterly <lb/>
            misled and deprived of their judgment, were to think him so, <lb/>
            being corrupted by a double evil, pride and vain opinion, by <lb/>
            which souls without ballast must infallibly be tossed about <lb/>
            and driven out of their course; for these evils, above all others, <lb/>
            injure the chief multitude of mankind.</p>
          <p>If, then, fixing the eyes of the mind steadily upon the truth, <lb/>
            you should be inclined to contemplate the providence of God as far <lb/>
            as the powers of human reason are capable of doing it, then, when <lb/>
            you have attained to a closer conception of the true and only good, <lb/>
            you will laugh at those things which belong to men which you <lb/>
            for some time admired; for what is worse is always honoured <lb/>
            in the absence of what is better, as it then usurps its place; <lb/>
            but when that which is better appears, then that which is <lb/>
            worse retires, and is contented with the second prize. There­ <lb/>
            fore, admiring that godlike excellence and beauty, you will by <lb/>
            all means perceive that none of the things previously men­ <lb/>
            tioned were by themselves thought worthy of the better portion <lb/>
            by God. On which account the mines of silver and gold are <lb/>
            the most worthless portion of the earth, which is altogether <lb/>
            and wholly unfit for the production of fruits and food ; for <lb/>
            abundance of riches is not like food, a thing without which one <lb/>
            cannot live. And the one great and manifest test of all these <lb/>
            things is hunger, by which it is seen what is in truth really <lb/>
            necessary and useful; for a person when oppressed by hunger <note type="footnote"> * Homer'a Iliad xx 234. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="225"/>
            would gladly give all the treasures in the whole world in <lb/>
            exchange for a little food; but when there is an abundance of <lb/>
            necessary things poured out in a plentiful and unlimited sup­ <lb/>
            ply, and flowing over all the cities of the land, then we, the <lb/>
            citizens, indulging luxuriously in the good things provided <lb/>
            by nature, are not contented to stop at them alone, but set up <lb/>
            satiated insolence as the guide of our lives, and devoting <lb/>
            ourselves to the acquisition of silver and gold, and of everything <lb/>
            else by which we hope to acquire gain, proceed in everything <lb/>
            like blind men, no longer exciting the eyes of our intellect by <lb/>
            reason of our covetousness, so far as to see that riches are but <lb/>
            the burden of the earth, and are the cause of continual and <lb/>
            uninterrupted war instead of peace.</p>
          <p>Our garments are indeed, as some one of the poets says <lb/>
            somewhere, " the flower of the sheep ;” but with reference to <lb/>
            the art displayed in their manufacture, they are the praise of <lb/>
            the weavers. And if any one is proud of any glory which he <lb/>
            may have acquired, being greatly delighted at his popularity <lb/>
            among worthless people, he should know that he also is worth­ <lb/>
            less, for he delights in them. And let such a man pray to <lb/>
            receive purification so as to have the disease of his ears healed, <lb/>
            as it is through his ears that his soul is affected with great <lb/>
            diseases. Again: let those men who are proud of their <lb/>
            personal strength and activity learn not to be high-minded on <lb/>
            such an account, looking at countless kinds of both domes­ <lb/>
            ticated and wild beasts, which are also endowed with great <lb/>
            strength and power; for it is the most absurd thing imaginable <lb/>
            for one who is a man to pride himself on the good qualities of <lb/>
            beasts, and that too when the beasts themselves are thought of <lb/>
            no importance whatever by him.</p>
          <p>Again : why should any man in his senses rejoice at beauty <lb/>
            of person, which a short period must extinguish before it has <lb/>
            flourished for any great length of time, since time always <lb/>
            obscures its deceitful prime ? and this too, when he sees that <lb/>
            even in lifeless things there are objects of surpassing beauty, <lb/>
            such as the works of painters, and sculptors, and other artists, <lb/>
            displayed in paintings, and statues, and all kinds of embroidery, <lb/>
            and weaving, which are held in the greatest honour in Greece <lb/>
            and in the countries of the barbarians in every city. Of these <lb/>
            things, then, as I have said, not one is accounted by God worthy <lb/>
            of the better portion. <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV </note> <note type="footnote"> Q </note> <pb n="226"/>
            </p>
          <p>And why should we wonder if they are not highly esteemed <lb/>
            by God? for they are not even by those men who are very <lb/>
            religious and devout, among whom those things which are <lb/>
            really good and virtuous are held in honour, inasmuch as they <lb/>
            have a good and well-disposed nature, and have improved their <lb/>
            natural good qualities by study and practice, of which a genuine <lb/>
            true philosophy is the maker. But those who have devoted <lb/>
            themselves to a bastard kind of philosophy have not even <lb/>
            imitated physicians who give their attention to the body, the <lb/>
            slave of the soul, though nevertheless they affirm that they are <lb/>
            healing the mistress, that is to say, the soul itself; for then, <lb/>
            when any such man is sick, even if he be the great king him­ <lb/>
            self, passing over all the colonnades, and the men's chambers, <lb/>
            and the women's chambers, and the pictures, and the silver and <lb/>
            the gold, whether in money or in bullion, and the vast treasures of <lb/>
            cups and works of embroidery, and all the rest of the celebrated <lb/>
            ornaments of kings, and the multitude of his servants, and of his <lb/>
            friends, or relatives, and subjects, and the chief officers who are <lb/>
            about his person, and his bodyguards, they come up to his bed­ <lb/>
            side, paying no attention even to the decorations of his person, <lb/>
            and not stopping to notice with admiration that his bed is inlaid <lb/>
            with precious stones, or that his coverlet is of the finest work­ <lb/>
            manship and the most exquisite embroidery, nor that the <lb/>
            fashion of his garments is of superlative beauty, but they even <lb/>
            pull off the clothes in which he is wrapped, and lay hold of his <lb/>
            hands, and press his veins, and feel his pulse, and note its <lb/>
            beating accurately to see if it is in a healthy condition; very <lb/>
            often too, they pull up his tunic and feel whether his stomach <lb/>
            is too full, whether his chest is feverish, whether his heart <lb/>
            beats irregularly. And then, when they have ascertained the <lb/>
            symptoms, they apply the appropriate remedies.</p>
          <p>And in like manner, it would become philosophers who pro. <lb/>
            fess to be versed in the healing science as applicable to the <lb/>
            soul, which is by nature the dominant part of the man, to <lb/>
            despise all the things which erroneous opinion raises up as <lb/>
            objects of pride, and to penetrate within, and to lay their <lb/>
            hands upon the intellect itself, to see whether through passion <lb/>
            its pulses are of an uneven rapidity and moving in an irregular <lb/>
            and unnatural manner, and to touch the tongue, and see <lb/>
            whether it is rough and devoted to evil-speaking, whether it is <lb/>
            prostituted to evil purposes and unmanageable; also to touch <lb/>
             <pb n="227"/>
            the belly, and see whether it is swollen with the insatiable <lb/>
            characteristics of desire, and, in short, of any other passions, <lb/>
            and diseases, and infirmities, and to examine every one of <lb/>
            those feelings, if they appear to be in a state of confusion, so <lb/>
            that they may not be ignorant of what is proper to be applied <lb/>
            to the soul with a reference to its cure.</p>
          <p>But now being lightened up all round by the brilliancy of <lb/>
            external things, as being unable to see that light which is <lb/>
            perceptible only by the intellect, they have passed their whole <lb/>
            existence in a state of error, not being able to penetrate as far <lb/>
            as royal thought, but being with difficulty able to reach the <lb/>
            outer courts, and admiring those servants who stand at the <lb/>
            gates of virtue, wealth, and glory, and health, and other <lb/>
            kindred circumstances, they fall down in adoration before <lb/>
            them. But as it would be an extravagance of insanity to take <lb/>
            blind men for judges of colour, or deaf men as judges of the <lb/>
            sounds of music, so it is a most preposterous act to take wicked <lb/>
            men as judges of real good. For these men are mutilated in <lb/>
            the most important parts of themselves, namely, their intellect, <lb/>
            over which folly has shed a deep darkness. Do we then now <lb/>
            wonder if Socrates, and such and such a virtuous man, has lived <lb/>
            in purity ? men who have never once studied any of the means <lb/>
            of providing themselves with pecuniary resources, and who <lb/>
            have never, even when it was in their power, condescended to <lb/>
            accept great gifts which have been tendered to their accept­ <lb/>
            ance by wealthy friends or mighty kings, because they looked <lb/>
            upon the acquisition of virtue as the only good, the only <lb/>
            beautiful thing, and have therefore laboured at that, and disre­ <lb/>
            garded all other good things.</p>
          <p>And who is there who would not disregard spurious good <lb/>
            things in comparison of genuine ones? But if while they <lb/>
            received a mortal body, and were full of liability to all kinds of <lb/>
            human disasters, and lived among such a number of unjust <lb/>
            actions and unrighteous men, of which the very number is not <lb/>
            easy to compute accurately, they were plotted against by their <lb/>
            enemies, why do we blame nature when we ought rather to <lb/>
            accuse the barbarity of those who thus set upon them ? For <lb/>
            so in like manner, if they had been placed in a pestilential <lb/>
            climate, they would inevitably have become sick ; and wicked­ <lb/>
            ness is even more, or at all events not less, destructive than a <lb/>
            pestilential state of the atmosphere. But as when there is rain <note type="footnote"> Q 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            the wise man, if he is in the open air, must inevitably get wet <lb/>
            through, and if the cold north wind blows he must be <lb/>
            oppressed by cold and shivering, and when summer is at its <lb/>
            height he must feel the heat, for it is a law of nature that the <lb/>
            bodies of men should be simultaneously affected by the changes <lb/>
            of the seasons; so also in the same way a man who lives in <lb/>
            such places, <lb/>
            “Where slaughters dire and famines might prevail, <lb/>
            And all the ills which thus mankind assail," <lb/>
            must inevitably pay the penalty which such evils inflict upon <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>Since in the case of Polycrates at least, in retaliation for the <lb/>
            terrible acts of injustice and impiety which he committed, <lb/>
            there fell upon him great misery in his subsequent life as a <lb/>
            terrible requital for his previous good fortune. Add to this <lb/>
            that he was chastised by a mighty sovereign, and was crucified <lb/>
            by him, fulfilling the prediction of the oracle: " I knew," <lb/>
            said he, " long before I took it into my head to go to consult <lb/>
            the oracle, that I was anointed by the sun and washed by <lb/>
            Jupiter," for these enigmatical assertions, expressed in symbol­ <lb/>
            ical language having been originally couched in unintelligible <lb/>
            language, afterwards receive a most manifest confirmation by <lb/>
            the events which followed them. But it was not only at the <lb/>
            end of his existence, but indeed during the whole period of his <lb/>
            life from its earliest commencement that he was, though with­ <lb/>
            out being aware of it, making his soul to depend wholly on his <lb/>
            body; for as lie was always in a state of alarm and trepidation, <lb/>
            he feared the multitude of enemies who might possibly attack <lb/>
            him, being well assured that no one in the world was really <lb/>
            well affected towards him, but that every one was hostile to <lb/>
            him, and would turn out implacable enemies if he should be <lb/>
            unfortunate.</p>
          <p>Again, of unsuccessful and yet of never-ending precautions <lb/>
            those writers who have written the history of Sicily are wit­ <lb/>
            nesses, for they say that the tyrant of Sicily suspected even his <lb/>
            most affectionately loved wife; and a proof of this is that he <lb/>
            ordered the entrance of his chamber by which she was about <lb/>
            to have access to him to be strewed with planks, in order that <lb/>
            she might never come upon him without being observed, but <lb/>
            that the noise and tumult made by her stepping on these boards <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            might indicate her approach beforehand; and besides this he <lb/>
            compelled her to come not only without her robe, but even <lb/>
            naked in every part, and even in those which ought not to be <lb/>
            seen by men. And in addition to this he ordered the whole <lb/>
            of the flooring along the road to be cut in width and depth <lb/>
            like a trench made by farmers, out of fear lest anything <lb/>
            should be secretly concealed so as to plot against him, which <lb/>
            would inevitably be detected by the leaps and long steps <lb/>
            which a person coming along this path would be compelled to <lb/>
            take.</p>
          <p>Of how many miseries, then, was that man full who took all <lb/>
            these precautions and practised all these contrivances against <lb/>
            his own wife, whom he ought to have trusted above all other <lb/>
            human beings ? But he was like those men who scale pre­ <lb/>
            cipices and climb over abrupt and steep mountains for the <lb/>
            purpose of attaining to a more accurate comprehension of the <lb/>
            natures of things in heaven, who at last after they have with <lb/>
            great difficulty ascended to some overhanging ridge, find them­ <lb/>
            selves unable to advance any further as they are too much <lb/>
            exhausted to think of attempting the remaining portion of the <lb/>
            mountain, and also want courage to descend, being giddy at <lb/>
            the sight of the chasms and ravines below them; for he, being <lb/>
            in love with sovereign power as a godlike thing to be desired <lb/>
            above all other objects, looked upon it as unsafe either to <lb/>
            remain where he was or to retreat, for he considered that if <lb/>
            he remained where he was innumerable other evils would <lb/>
            come upon him in rapid and uninterrupted succession, while if <lb/>
            he decided on retracing his steps his very life would be in <lb/>
            danger, as there were enemies around, if not as to their bodies <lb/>
            at all events in their minds, against him.</p>
          <p>And he also showed the truth of all this by the treatment to <lb/>
            which he exposed a friend of his who spoke of the life of a <lb/>
            tyrant as one of complete and absolute happiness; for, having <lb/>
            invited him to a banquet which had been prepared in a most <lb/>
            brilliant and costly manner, he ordered a sharp sword to be <lb/>
            suspended over his head by a very fine thread, and when he, <lb/>
            after he had sat down to the banquet, on a sudden perceived <lb/>
            it, not daring to rise up and quit his place for fear of the <lb/>
            tyrant, and not being able to enjoy any of the things which <lb/>
            were prepared out of fear, he disregarded all the abundant and <lb/>
            superb luxuries by which he was surrounded, and keeping his <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            neck and his eyes turned upwards, sat in the expectation of <lb/>
            instant death.*</p>
          <p>And when Dionysius perceived the state in which he was, <lb/>
            he said to him, " Do you then at last begin to understand the <lb/>
            true character of that illustrious and enviable life of ours, for <lb/>
            this is what it really is if a man chooses to speak of it without <lb/>
            flattery or disguise, since it contains indeed a great abundance <lb/>
            of resources and supplies, but no enjoyment of any real bless­ <lb/>
            ing ; and it causes its possessor incessant fears and irremedi­ <lb/>
            able and unavoidable dangers, and a disease worse than the <lb/>
            most contagious or most fatal sickness, which is continually <lb/>
            threatening inevitable death. But the inconsiderate multitude, <lb/>
            being deceived by the outward brilliancy and splendour of the <lb/>
            position, are like people who are attracted by showy looking <lb/>
            courtesans, who, concealing their real deformity under fine <lb/>
            clothes and golden ornaments, and pencilling their eyes from <lb/>
            want of any real beauty, manufacture a spurious beauty in order <lb/>
            to lie in wait for and catch the beholders.</p>
          <p>Now men who are placed in situations of great prosperity <lb/>
            are full of such unhappiness as this, of the greatness of which <lb/>
            they themselves are fully aware, and they do not at all keep it <lb/>
            to themselves, but like men who under compulsion divulge <lb/>
            secret things, they often utter the truest possible expressions, <lb/>
            which are extorted from them by suffering, living in the con­ <lb/>
            tinual company of punishment both present and expected, just <lb/>
            like cattle who are being fattened up for sacrifice, for they too <note type="footnote"> * Horace alludes to the story of Damocles, Od. III. i. 16. <lb/>

             <pb n="231"/>
            are treated with the greatest possible attention in order to be <lb/>
            fit to be sacrificed by reason of their fleshiness and good con­ <lb/>
            dition. There are also some men who have suffered punish­ <lb/>
            ment, and that not concealed, but visible, and notorious for <lb/>
            the impiety of the means by which they have acquired riches, <lb/>
            the names and numbers of whom it would be superfluous to <lb/>
            enumerate, but it will be sufficient to bring forward one <lb/>
            instance as a specimen of the whole.</p>
          <p>It is said, then, by those who have written the History of <lb/>
            the Sacred War in Phocis that as there was a law established <lb/>
            that any one who was guilty of sacrilege should be either <lb/>
            thrown down a precipice, or drowned in the sea, or burnt alive, <lb/>
            that those men who had pillaged the temple at Delphi, by <lb/>
            name Pbilomelus, and Onomarchus, and Phayllus, divided <lb/>
            these punishments among them, for that the first fell down a <lb/>
            rugged and precipitous rock and was dashed to pieces on the <lb/>
            stones, and that the second, when the horse which he was <lb/>
            riding grew restive and plunged down towards the sea, was <lb/>
            overwhelmed by the waves, and so fell alive into a devouring <lb/>
            gulf; and Phayllus was wasted away by a consumptive disease <lb/>
            (for the way in which the story is told about him is twofold), <lb/>
            or else perished in the temple at Abæ, being burnt in it when <lb/>
            it was destroyed by fire. For it must be the mere spirit of <lb/>
            obstinacy and arguing to say that all these events took place <lb/>
            by mere chance, for if indeed one or two of them had been <lb/>
            punished at different periods or by some other mode of punish­ <lb/>
            ment, then it would have been reasonable to impute their fate <lb/>
            to the uncertainty of fortune, but when they all died together <lb/>
            and at one time, and by no other punishment but by that <lb/>
            precise end which is appointed in the laws for the punishment <lb/>
            of such crimes as those of which they had been guilty, it is <lb/>
            surely fair to say that they perished by the direct condemnation <lb/>
            of God.</p>
          <p>But if any of the violent men who are unmentioned, and <lb/>
            who have at different times risen up against the people in their <lb/>
            several states, and have enslaved not only other nations, but <lb/>
            their own countries too, have still died without meeting with <lb/>
            punishment, it is not to be wondered at, for in the first place <lb/>
            man does not judge as God judges, because we investigate <lb/>
            what is visible to ourselves, but he descends into the secret <lb/>
            recesses of the soul without making any noise, and there con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            templates the mind in the clear light, as if in the sun; for <lb/>
            stripping off from it all the ornaments in which it is enveloped, <lb/>
            and seeing its devices and intentions naked, he immediately <lb/>
            distinguishes between the bad and the good.</p>
          <p>Let not us then, preferring our own judgment to that of <lb/>
            God, assert that it is more unerring or more full of wisdom <lb/>
            than his, for that is not consistent with holiness; for in the <lb/>
            one there are many things which deceive it, such as the <lb/>
            treacherous outward senses, the insidious character of the <lb/>
            passions, the most terrible attacks of vice, but in the other <lb/>
            there is nothing which can at all conduce to deceit or error, <lb/>
            but justice and truth, by which each separate action is deter­ <lb/>
            mined on, and in this way is naturally rectified in the most <lb/>
            praiseworthy manner.</p>
          <p>Do not thou, then, my good friend, consider tyrannical <lb/>
            power, that most unprofitable of all things, to be a seasonable <lb/>
            possession; for neither is punishment disadvantageous, but it <lb/>
            is either more beneficial, or at all events not injurious to the <lb/>
            good to suffer due punishment, on which account it is expressly <lb/>
            comprehended in all laws which are wisely enacted, and those <lb/>
            who have established such laws are praised by every one; for <lb/>
            what a tyrant is in a people, that is punishment in a law.</p>
          <p>When therefore a want and terrible scarcity of virtue seizes <lb/>
            upon cities, and when a great abundance of folly overwhelms <lb/>
            everything, then God, like the stream of an overflowing torrent, <lb/>
            being desirous to wash away all the power and impetuosity of <lb/>
            wickedness, in order to purify our race, gives vigour and power <lb/>
            to those men who by their natures are fitted to exercise <lb/>
            dominion, for without a stern soul wickedness cannot be got <lb/>
            rid of. And just as cities keep executioners for the punish­ <lb/>
            ment of murderers, and traitors, and sacrilegious persons, not <lb/>
            because they approve of the dispositions of the men, but <lb/>
            because they have need of the serviceable part of their minis­ <lb/>
            trations ; in the same manner the Ruler of this mighty city, <lb/>
            the world, appoints tyrants, like ordinary executioners, to be <lb/>
            over those cities in which he sees that violence, and injustice, <lb/>
            and impiety prevail, and all other kinds of evils in abundance, <lb/>
            that he may by these means put an end to their existence. <lb/>
            And then he thinks it right to pursue the guilty, as men who <lb/>
            have been serving these vices from the impulses of an impure <lb/>
            and pitiless soul, with every punishment imaginable, as the <lb/>
             <pb n="233"/>
            ringleaders; for as the power of fire when it has consumed the <lb/>
            fuel which was given to it, at last consumes itself also, so also <lb/>
            do those who have received supreme power over nations, when <lb/>
            they have exhausted the cities and rendered them destitute of <lb/>
            inhabitants, at last perish themselves among them, suffering <lb/>
            due punishment for all that they have done.</p>
          <p>And why should we wonder if God employs the agency of <lb/>
            tyrants to get rid of wickedness when widely diffused over <lb/>
            cities, and countries, and nations? For he very often uses <lb/>
            other ministers, and himself brings about the same end by his <lb/>
            own resources, inflicting upon the nation famine, or pestilence, <lb/>
            or earthquakes, or any other heaven-sent calamity, by which <lb/>
            great and numerous multitudes perish every day, and by which <lb/>
            a great portion of the habitable world is made desolate, on <lb/>
            account of his care for the preservation of virtue.</p>
          <p>Therefore I have now, as I conceive, spoken at sufficient <lb/>
            length on the present subject, namely, that no wicked man is <lb/>
            happy, by which fact above all others it may be established <lb/>
            that there is such a thing as providence ; but if you are not <lb/>
            thoroughly convinced, then tell me boldly what is the doubt <lb/>
            which is still lurking in your mind, for then both of us by <lb/>
            labouring together shall be able to see clearly what the real <lb/>
            truth is.</p>
          <p>And after some more arguments, he proceeds thus :-</p>
          <p>God causes the violent storms of wind and, rain which we <lb/>
            see, not for the injury of those who traverse the sea, as you <lb/>
            fancied, or of those who till the earth, but for the general <lb/>
            benefit of the whole of the human race, for with his water he <lb/>
            cleanses the earth, and with his breezes he purifies all the <lb/>
            regions beneath the moon, and by the united influence of both <lb/>
            he nourishes and promotes the growth and brings to perfection <lb/>
            both animals and plants. And if at times these things do <lb/>
            injure those who put to sea or who till the land at unseason­ <lb/>
            able moments, it is not to be wondered at, for these men are <lb/>
            but a small portion of the human race, and the care of God is <lb/>
            exerted for the benefit of all mankind.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, in a gymnastic school oil is placed there for <lb/>
            the common benefit of every one, but still it often happens <lb/>
            that the master of the school, by reason of some political <lb/>
            necessity changes the arrangement of the usual hours of <lb/>
            exercise, by which means some of those who wish to anoint <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            themselves come too late; in like manner God, who takes <lb/>
            care of the whole world as if it were a city committed to his <lb/>
            charge, does sometimes cause the summer to resemble winter, <lb/>
            and winter to assume the characteristics of spring, for the <lb/>
            common benefit of the universe, even though some captains of <lb/>
            ships, or some cultivators of the ground, may very likely be <lb/>
            injured by this irregularity of the seasons. Therefore He, <lb/>
            being aware that the occasional interchanges of the elements <lb/>
            with one another, out of which the world was made, and of <lb/>
            which it consists, are a work of the greatest importance and <lb/>
            necessity, supplies them without allowing anything to be an <lb/>
            obstacle to them ; and frost and snow-storms, and other things <lb/>
            of that kind, follow the cooling of the air. And, again, light­ <lb/>
            nings and thunders arise from the collision and repercussion <lb/>
            of the clouds, none of which things are perhaps effected by any <lb/>
            immediate exertion of providence, but the rains and winds are <lb/>
            the causes of existence, and nourishment, and growth to all <lb/>
            things which are upon the earth, and these phenomena are the <lb/>
            natural consequences of those others</p>
          <p>For just as it often happens, when the master of a gymnas­ <lb/>
            tic school, out of rivalry, has gone to extravagant expense, then <lb/>
            some of those who are ignorant of all that is becoming, having <lb/>
            been bespattered with oil instead of water, let all the drops <lb/>
            from them fall upon the boards, and then a most slippery mud <lb/>
            is the result: nevertheless a man, whose appreciations were <lb/>
            just would not say that the hard and the slippery state of the <lb/>
            ground was caused by the intention of the master of the <lb/>
            school, but that these things had resulted accidentally, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the abundant quantity of the things supplied. <lb/>
            Again, the rainbow, and the halo, and all other things of that <lb/>
            kind, are natural consequences of those things becoming <lb/>
            mingled with the clouds, not being occurrences which lead <lb/>
            and influence nature, but being the results and consequences <lb/>
            of the operations of nature.</p>
          <p>Not but what these very things themselves do also afford <lb/>
            some signs of great importance to wise men, for, guiding <lb/>
            their conjectures by them, they predict calms and storms of <lb/>
            wind, and fine weather, and tempests. Do you not see the <lb/>
            porticoes which embellish the cities ? the greater part of these <lb/>
            look towards the south, in order that those who walk under <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            them may be warm in the winter, and may be cool in the <lb/>
            summer.</p>
          <p>There is also another thing which does not happen through <lb/>
            the intention of Him who made it, and what is this ? the <lb/>
            shadows which fall from the feet indicate the hours to our <lb/>
            experience. And again, fire is a most important work of <lb/>
            nature, but the consequence of fire is smoke, and nevertheless <lb/>
            even this too at times is of some service. At all events in <lb/>
            the heat, in the middle of the day, when the fire is rendered <lb/>
            invisible by the brilliancy of the beams of the sun, the ap­ <lb/>
            proach of enemies is indicated by the smoke, and the principle <lb/>
            which causes the rainbow is also the same which, in some <lb/>
            degree, regulates eclipses.</p>
          <p>For eclipses are a natural consequence of the rules which <lb/>
            regulate the divine natures of the sun and moon; and they <lb/>
            are indications either of the impending death of some king, or <lb/>
            of the destruction of some city, as Pindar also has told us in <lb/>
            enigmatical terms, alluding to such events as the conse­ <lb/>
            quences of the omens which I have now been mentioning.­ <note type="footnote"> * This theory of the eclipses of the sun and other natural prodigies <lb/>

            What the late eve or early morn prepares, <lb/>
            And when the south projects a stormy day, <lb/>
            And when the clearing north will puff the clouds away. <lb/>
            The sun reveals the secrets of the sky, <lb/>
            And who dares give the source of light the lie ? <lb/>
            The change of empires often he declares, <lb/>
            Fierce tumults, hidden treasons, open wars. <lb/>
            He first the fate of Cæsar did foretell, <lb/>
            And pitied Rome, when Rome in C2esar fell, <lb/>
            In iron clouds concealed the public light, <lb/>
            And impious mortals feared eternal night. <lb/>
            Nor was the fact foretold by him alone, <lb/>
            Nature herself stood forth and seconded the sun. <lb/>
            Earth, air, and seas with prodigies were signed, <lb/>
            And birds obscene and howling dogs divined; <lb/>
            What rocks did Ætna’s bellowing mouth expire <lb/>
            From her torn entrails! and what floods of fire. <lb/>
            What clanks were heard in German skies afar <lb/>
            Of arms and armies rushing to the war. <lb/>
            Dire earthquakes rent the solid Alps below, <lb/>
            And from their summits shook the eternal snow. <lb/>
            Pale spectres in the close of night were seen, <lb/>
            And voices heard of more than mortal men. <lb/>
            In silent groves dumb sheep and oxen spoke, <lb/>
            And streams ran backward and their beds forsook; <lb/>
            The yawning earth disclosed the abyss of hell, <lb/>
            The weeping statues did the wars foretell, <lb/>
            And holy sweat from brazen idols fell <lb/>
            Then rising in his might, the king of floods <lb/>
            Rushed through the forests, tore the lofty woods, <lb/>
            And rolling o awards, with a sweepy sway <lb/>
            Bore houses, lands, and labouring hinds away. <lb/>
            Blood sprang from wells, wolves howled in turns by night. <lb/>

            customed to investigate the principles of nature should shrink <lb/>
            from examining into it: for the discovery of those things is <lb/>
            most beneficial, and the investigation of them is intrinsically <lb/>
            most delightful for its own sake, to those who are fond of <lb/>
            learning.</p>
          <p>For as the sun and moon exist in consequence of Provi­ <lb/>
            dence, so also do all things in heaven, even though we are <lb/>
            unable to trace out accurately the respective natures and pow­ <lb/>
            ers of each, and are, therefore, reduced to silence about them; <lb/>
            and earthquakes, and pestilences, and the fall of thunderbolts, <lb/>
            and things of that kind, are said indeed to be sent by God, <lb/>
            but, in reality, they are not so, for God is absolutely not the <lb/>
            cause of any evil whatever of any kind, but the natural changes <lb/>
            of the elements produce these effects, not as circumstances <lb/>
            which guide nature, but as those which are followed by <lb/>
            necessary results, and which do themselves follow naturally <lb/>
            upon their antecedent causes. And if some people, who think <lb/>
            themselves entitled to immunity meet with some injury <lb/>
            from these things, they are still not to find fault with their <lb/>
            management and dispensation; for, in the first place, it does <lb/>
            not follow, that if some persons are reckoned virtuous among <lb/>
            men, they are so in real truth; since the criteria by which <lb/>
            God judges are far more accurate than any of the tests by <lb/>
            which the human mind is guided. And, in the second place, <lb/>
            prophetic wisdom loves to contemplate those things in the <lb/>
            world which are of the most comprehensive nature, as in the <lb/>
            case of monarchies, and in the governments of armies, we see <lb/>
            that it is not any obscure, ignoble, or chance person who is <lb/>
            appointed to govern the cities or the armies.</p>
          <p>And some persons say that as on occasion of the slaying of <lb/>
            tyrants, it is lawful that their relations also should be put to <lb/>
            death, in order that transgressions may be checked by the ter­ <lb/>
            rible magnitude of the punishment inflicted: in like manner <lb/>
            in pestilential diseases, it is necessary that some of those who <lb/>
            are not guilty should be involved in the destruction, in order <note type="footnote"> Such peals of thunder never poured from high, <lb/>
            Nor forky lightnings flashed from such a sullen sky; <lb/>
            Red meteors ran across the ethereal space, <lb/>
            Stars disappeared and comets took their place. <lb/>
            For this the Emathian plains once more were strewed <lb/>
            With Roman bodies, and just heaven thought good <lb/>

            that others who are at a distance may learn moderation. Besides <lb/>
            that, it is inevitable that those who are exposed to a pesti­ <lb/>
            lential atmosphere must become diseased just as all persons <lb/>
            who are exposed to a storm on board a ship must be all <lb/>
            exposed to equal danger. But those wild beasts which are <lb/>
            courageous have been created; for we must not suppress the <lb/>
            truth (as if one were to anticipate the defence likely to be <lb/>
            made by a man of powerful eloquence and tare it to pieces be­ <lb/>
            forehand), in order that men may, by practising against them, <lb/>
            acquire hardihood for the contests of war; for gymnastic exer­ <lb/>
            cises and continued hunting train men and inure their souls <lb/>
            in a greater degree even than their bodies to rely upon their <lb/>
            own courage, and energy, and strength, so as to disregard the <lb/>
            sudden attacks of their enemies.</p>
          <p>But those men who are of peaceable character are at liberty <lb/>
            to keep themselves not only within their walls, but also even <lb/>
            within tents, and there to live in privacy, safe from the designs <lb/>
            of any enemies, having vast and countless herds of domestic' <lb/>
            animals to help their enjoyment; since boars and lions, and <lb/>
            animals of that kind, are by their own instinct driven to a dis­ <lb/>
            tance from cities, not being inclined to expose themselves to <lb/>
            danger in consequence of the devices of men. And if any <lb/>
            men, being influenced by a spirit of laziness and indolence, <lb/>
            living without arms and without preparation, dwell fearlessly <lb/>
            among the haunts of wild beasts, then if anything happens to <lb/>
            them they must blame not nature but themselves, because <lb/>
            when they might have guarded against any such disasters, <lb/>
            they have neglected them. Accordingly, before now, I have <lb/>
            seen at the horse-races some persons acting in a most careless <lb/>
            manner, who, when they ought to have sat still and to have <lb/>
            beheld the races in an orderly manner, standing in the middle <lb/>
            have been knocked down by the horses' feet and by the wheels, <lb/>
            and have met with a proper reward for their folly.</p>
          <p>We have now, then, said enough on this subject.</p>
          <p>But of reptiles, those which are venomous have not been <lb/>
            called into existence by an immediate providence, but by the <lb/>
            natural consequences of events, as I said before; for they are <lb/>
            brought into life when the moisture which is in them changes <lb/>
            to a more violent heat; and some are vivified by putrefaction, <lb/>
            as, for instance, the putrefaction of meat produces maggots, and <lb/>
            that which is caused by perspiration produces lice; but all <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            those which are produced out of a kindred substance, and <lb/>
            which have their generation in. accordance with the usual <lb/>
            spermatic principles which I have mentioned before, are very <lb/>
            naturally ascribed to an immediate providence. And I have <lb/>
            also heard two accounts given of them as having been created <lb/>
            for the advantage of mankind, which I should not think it well <lb/>
            to conceal. Now one of them is the following.</p>
          <p>Some persons have said that venomous animals contribute <lb/>
            greatly to many of the objects of physicians, and that those <lb/>
            who reduce that science to a regular system use them in a <lb/>
            proper manner, and, acting with great wisdom and prudence, <lb/>
            have discovered antidotes, so as to be able to contribute to the <lb/>
            unexpected safety of those who were in the greatest possible <lb/>
            danger; and even at the present time one may see thoSe <lb/>
            persons who apply themselves to the study of medicine, in a <lb/>
            careful and diligent manner, using all these animals and plants <lb/>
            in a most skilful manner in the composition of drugs.</p>
          <p>The other account has no reference to the practice of phy­ <lb/>
            sicians, but only as it would seem to the studies of philosophers. <lb/>
            For it says that all these things have been prepared by God as <lb/>
            engines of punishment against offenders, just as generals and <lb/>
            rulers prepare halters and chains. On which account, though <lb/>
            they are quiet at other times, they are brought out with great <lb/>
            power in the case of people who have been condemned, and <lb/>
            whom nature in her incorruptible tribunal has sentenced to <lb/>
            death ; for that they lurk in secret holes and in houses, is a <lb/>
            falsehood: for it is seen that these creatures flee out of the <lb/>
            cities into the fields and into desert places, to avoid man as <lb/>
            their master. Not but what, if this is true, there is a certain <lb/>
            sense and principle in it; for rubbish is heaped up in recesses: <lb/>
            and quantities of sweepings, and refuse, and such things, are <lb/>
            what venomous reptiles love to lurk in, besides the fact that <lb/>
            their smell has an attractive power over them.</p>
          <p>Again, if swallows live among us, it is not at all strange, for <lb/>
            we abstain from hunting them ; and a desire of safety is im­ <lb/>
            planted not only in the souls of rational creatures, but also in <lb/>
            those of irrational animals.</p>
          <p>But of those animals which tend to our enjoyment, there is <lb/>
            not one which lives with us by reason of the designs which we <lb/>
            form against them, except that some do live with those nations <lb/>
            to whom the use of them is forbidden by the law. There is a <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            city of Syria, on the sea shore, Ascalon by name : when I was <lb/>
            there, at the time when I was on my journey towards the <lb/>
            temple of my native land for the purpose of offering up prayers <lb/>
            and sacrifices therein, I saw a most incalculable number of <lb/>
            pigeons on the roads and about every house ; and when I <lb/>
            inquired the cause of their being there in such numbers, they <lb/>
            said that it was not lawful to catch them, for that the use of <lb/>
            them had been prohibited to the inhabitants from the earliest <lb/>
            ages ; and so the bird had become so thoroughly tame through <lb/>
            fearlessness, that it not only hovered about the roofs and came <lb/>
            into the houses, but approached their tables also, and grew <lb/>
            luxurious in the alliance which it had thus formed.</p>
          <p>And in Egypt we may see a still more marvellous thing; <lb/>
            for the crocodile is the most odious of all animals, and one <lb/>
            addicted to devour man ; and it is born and brought up in the <lb/>
            most sacred way, and although residing in the depths, it feels <lb/>
            the benefits which it receives from mankind ; for in those tribes, <lb/>
            among which it is honoured, it multiplies in the greatest de­ <lb/>
            gree, but among those who injure it it never appears at all: <lb/>
            so that there are places where even the most timid persons <lb/>
            when sailing by leap out of their ships and swim about with <lb/>
            their children.</p>
          <p>And in the country of the Cyclops, since the race of these <lb/>
            men is a fabulous invention, there is no eatable fruit whatever <lb/>
            produced except such as is raised from seed and cultivated by <lb/>
            husbandmen, just as nothing is produced from that which does <lb/>
            not exist; but we must not accuse Greece as being sterile and <lb/>
            unproductive, for there is a great deal of deep and rich soil in <lb/>
            it; and if the land of the barbarians is superior in fruitfulness, <lb/>
            though it is superior in the food which it produces, it is inferior <lb/>
            in the men who are nourished by the food, and for whose sake <lb/>
            the food is produced.</p>
          <p>For Greece is the only country which really produces man, <lb/>
            that heavenly plant, that divine on'short, producing that most <lb/>
            accurately refined reason which is appropriated by and akin <lb/>
            to knowledge; and the cause is this, it is the nature of the <lb/>
            intellect to be rendered acute by the lightness of the air; on <lb/>
            which account Heraclitus said with great propriety, " Where <lb/>
            the soil is dry, there the soul is most wise and most excellent <lb/>
            and any one may conjecture this from the fact, that men who <lb/>
            are sober and contented with a little are wise, and that those <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            who are continually filling themselves with meat and drink <lb/>
            are the least sensible, as if their reasoning faculties were <lb/>
            drowned by the quantity which they swallow.</p>
          <p>And on this account we see, in the countries of the bar­ <lb/>
            barians, trees and plants grow to the greatest possible size, <lb/>
            by reason of the abundance of nourishment which they receive ; <lb/>
            and we see too, that the irrational animals which are found in <lb/>
            these regions are the most prolific of any, but the mind is not <lb/>
            so, or, at all events, it is so in a very slight degree, because it <lb/>
            is elevated and raised out of the sether itself, while the inces­ <lb/>
            sant and uninterrupted evaporations of earth and water have <lb/>
            freely boiled over it. Again, the different kinds of fish, and <lb/>
            birds, and terrestrial animals, are not grounds for accusing <lb/>
            nature, which invites us to pleasure by those means, but are a <lb/>
            terrible reproach to us for our intemperate use of them, for it <lb/>
            was necessary, for the due completion of the universe, in order <lb/>
            that there should be order and regularity in every portion of <lb/>
            it, that there should be produced every possible species of <lb/>
            animal. But it was not necessary that that animal, which of <lb/>
            all others is most akin to wisdom, namely, man, should rush <lb/>
            with such eagerness to the enjoyment of it, as to change his <lb/>
            nature into something resembling the ferocity of wild beasts; <lb/>
            on which account, even up to the present time, those who have <lb/>
            any regard for temperance entirely abstain from such things, <lb/>
            eating only vegetables, and herbs, and the fruits of trees, as <lb/>
            the most delicious and wholesome food.</p>
          <p>And these men are instructors for those who look upon the <lb/>
            practice of eating such animals to be in accordance with <lb/>
            nature, and correct them, and are lawgivers to their respective <lb/>
            cities, being men who take care to check the immoderate <lb/>
            vehemence of the appetites, and who do not permit the <lb/>
            unrestrained use of everything to everybody.</p>
          <p>Again, if roses, and crocuses, and all the other beautiful <lb/>
            variety of flowers which we see, contribute to health, it would <lb/>
            not follow that they all contribute to pleasure; for the inde­ <lb/>
            scribable variety of them makes the powers of some of them <lb/>
            more conspicuous than those of others, just as there is a com­ <lb/>
            mingling of male and female, contributing to the generation of <lb/>
            an animal; neither of them being calculated, by itself, to <lb/>
            produce the effect which the two produce in combination.</p>
          <p>These things are said, in a most convincing manner, with <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>

            without real power in anything, never taking a firm hold of <lb/>
            anything. I do not mean merely of common things, but not <lb/>
            even of those which concern himself; neither of health, nor of <lb/>
            a good condition of the outward senses, nor of soundness in <lb/>
            respect of the other parts of his body, nor of his voice, nor of <lb/>
            his presence of mind ; for as to wealth, or glory, or friends, or <lb/>
            power, or all the other things which depend on fortune, who is <lb/>
            there who does not know how thoroughly unstable they are ? <lb/>
            So that we must of necessity confess that the supreme power <lb/>

          <p>P. 343. D. Some men, making improvement, have returned <lb/>
            back to virtue before coming to the end, the ancient principle <lb/>
            of oligarchy having destroyed the principle of aristocracy lately <lb/>

            <title type="sub">About resurrection and judgment.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 349. A. It is not possible with God that a wicked man <lb/>
            should lose his good reward for a single good thing which he <lb/>
            may have done among a great number of evil actions; nor, on <lb/>
            the other hand, that a good man should escape punishment, <lb/>
            and not suffer it, if among many good actions he has done <lb/>
            wickedly in anything, for it is infallibly certain that God dis­ <lb/>
            tributes everything according to a just weight and balance.</p>
          <p>Ibid. B. The mind is the witness to each individual of the <lb/>
            things which they have planned in secret, and conscience is an <lb/>
            incorruptible judge, and the most unerring of all judges.</p>

            <title type="sub">About those who are ruled.</title>

          <p>P. 359. A. He who has learnt how to submit to be ruled, <lb/>
            immediately learns how to rule others; for even if a man were <lb/>
            invested with the supreme power over all the earth and all the <lb/>
            sea, he would not be a true ruler unless he had also learnt and <lb/>
            been previously taught to submit to the rule of others.</p>

          <p>P. 359. D. Alas, how many and great evils are produced <lb/>
            by anarchy! Famine, war, the devastation of lands, the <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>P. 362. E. No wicked man is rich, not even though he <lb/>
            hould be the owner of all the mines in the whole world; but <lb/>
            ill foolish men are poor. Every foolish man is straitened, <lb/>
            being oppressed by covetousness, and ambition, and a love of <lb/>
            pleasure, and things of that sort, which do not permit the <lb/>

          <p>P. 363. A. There is no greater evil to a man than folly, <lb/>

          </ab>
          <p>P. 367. D. Every stratagem is not blameable, since <lb/>
            guardians of the night appear to act properly when they lie in <lb/>
            wait for robbers, and generals when they form ambuscades <lb/>
            against the enemy, whom they cannot catch without a strata­ <lb/>
            gem; and the same principle is applicable to what are called <lb/>
            manoeuvres, and to the artifices practised in the contests of <lb/>
            wrestlers, for in such cases deceit is accounted honourable.</p>

            <title type="sub">About impossible things.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 370. B. It is as impossible that the love of the world <lb/>
            can co-exist with the love of God, as for light and darkness to <lb/>
            co-exist at the same time with one another.</p>

            <title type="sub">About holy men.</title>

          <p>P. 372. E. The happy nature is that which rejoices on <lb/>
            every occasion, and which is not discontented with anything <lb/>
            whatever which exists in the world, but is pleased with what­ <lb/>
            ever happens, as being good, and beautiful, and expedient.</p>

            <title type="sub">About leisure and quiet.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 376. A. The wise man endeavours to secure quiet and <lb/>
            leisure, and periods of rest from work, that he may devote <lb/>
            himself peacefully to the meditations on divine matters.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">About evil-speaking.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 379. D. Foul speakers and random accusers, who seek <lb/>
            to make a display of their art with vain words, being slow to <lb/>
            learn what is good, are very quick and ready at learning what <lb/>
            is of the opposite character.</p>

            <title type="sub">About counsel.</title>

          <p>P. 397. D. Everything which is not done with reason is <lb/>

            <title type="sub">About old men.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 404. C. Old age is an unruffled harbour.</p>
          <p>Ibid. Old age is the time when the vigour of the body is <lb/>
            passed by; the period when the passions can be checked.</p>

            <title type="sub">About gymnasia.</title>

             <pb n="245"/>
            as want of practice engenders ignorance. And, again, practice <lb/>
            in any matter increases experience.</p>
          <p>Ibid. Study is the nurse of knowledge.</p>

            <title type="sub">About calumny.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 436. D. Calumniators and men discarded from the <lb/>
            divine grace, who are afflicted with the same evil disposition <lb/>
            of calumny with him, are in all respects hated and detested by <lb/>
            God, and removed to a distance from all happiness.</p>
          <p>Ibid. What can be worse than calumny? for it seduces <lb/>
            the ears and perplexes the minds of those who listen to it, and <lb/>
            it makes them brutal and always on a watch for evil, like men <lb/>
            engaged in hunting; but those who are well ballasted and <lb/>
            restrained by prudent reason, hate the man who utters calum­ <lb/>
            nies more than him against whom they are uttered, reproving <lb/>
            and seeking to check all desire of blaming others until it he <lb/>
            either proved by evidence or demonstrated by undeniable <lb/>

            <title type="sub">About justice and virtue.</title>

            <title type="sub">About voluntary and involuntary sins.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>P. 526. B. As to sin intentionally is unjust, so to sin <lb/>
            unintentionally and out of ignorance is not at once justifiable, <lb/>
            but perhaps it is something between the two, that is between <lb/>
            righteousness and unrighteousness, and is of what some persons <lb/>
            call an indifferent character, for no sin can be an act of <lb/>

            thou return to the dust from which thou wast taken ? For man <lb/>
            was not formed of the dust alone, but also of the divine Spirit; <lb/>
            but since he did not continue in an unchanged condition, be <lb/>
            neglected the divine command, and cutting off that constitution <lb/>
            which imitated the heaven from his better part, he made him. <lb/>
            self over wholly to the earth; for if he had been a lover of <lb/>
            virtue, which is immortal, he would beyond all question have <lb/>
            received heaven for his inheritance, but since what he sought <lb/>
            was pleasure, by means of which the death of the soul is <lb/>

          <p>P. 748. B. " And God brought all the animals to Adam, <lb/>
            to see what he would call them; †for God does not doubt, <lb/>
            but since he has given mind to man, the first born and most <lb/>
            excellent of his creatures, according to which he, being endowed <lb/>
            with knowledge, is by nature enabled to reason; he excites <lb/>
            him, as an instructor excites his pupil, to a display of his <lb/>
            powers, and he contemplates the most excellent offspring of <lb/>
            his soul. And, again, he visibly by the example of this man <lb/>
            gives an outline of all that is voluntary in us, looking with <lb/>
            disfavour on those who affirm that everything happens through <lb/>
            necessity, by which some men must be influenced, he on that <lb/>
            account commanded man to take upon himself the regulation <lb/>
            of these things. And this is an employment peculiarly fitting <lb/>
            for man, as being endowed with a very high degree of know­ <lb/>
            ledge and most surpassing prudence, the giving of names to <lb/>
            the animals being suited to him not only as being wise, but <lb/>
            also as being the first nobly born creature.</p>
          <p>For it was fitting that he should be the founder of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iui. 19. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            human race, and also the king of everything that is born of <lb/>
            the earth, and that he should have this as an especial honour <lb/>
            of his own, that, as he was the first who had any acquaintance <lb/>
            with the animals, he might also be the first inventor and <lb/>
            pronouncer of their names; for it would have been absurd for <lb/>
            them to be left without names, and subsequently to have names <lb/>
            given to them by some younger man, to the honour and glory <lb/>

            but that she was as it were a nature on the borders between <lb/>
            these two kinds, like a graft from a shoot of another vine taken <lb/>
            off and grafted into a second one, on which account he says, <lb/>
            " For this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother, <lb/>
            and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall become one <lb/>
            flesh in saying which he used a most gentle expression, <lb/>
            which was at the same time most perfectly true, meaning that <lb/>
            they would be united by sympathy in their griefs and joys.</p>

          <p>Truly the divine place is inaccessible, and one which is hard <lb/>
            to be approached, nor is it given even to the purest intellect <lb/>
            to be able to ascend to such a height as to touch it. It is <lb/>
            impossible for human nature to behold the face of the living <lb/>
            God; but the word " face" is not used here in its literal <lb/>
            meaning, but it is a metaphorical expression, here intended to <lb/>
            manifest the purest and simplest form of the living God, since <lb/>
            man is not recognized more by anything than by his face, <lb/>
            according to his peculiar distinctive qualities and form. For <lb/>
            God does not say, “I am not visible in my nature." But <lb/>
            who, in fact, is more visible than he who is the Father of all <lb/>
            visible things ? And being such with regard to being seen, I <lb/>
            am, says he, seen by no mortal man; and the reason of this <lb/>
            is the inability of the created man to behold him.</p>
          <p>And that I may not become prolix while weaving in all <lb/>
            kinds of arguments, it is inevitable that God must first be <lb/>
            created (which is not possible), in order for any one to be able <lb/>
            to comprehend God. But if any one dies as to this mortal <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="250"/>
            life, but still lives, having received in exchange a life of <lb/>
            immortality, perhaps he will see what he never saw before.</p>
          <p>All the different philosophical sects which have flourished in <lb/>
            Greece, and in the countries of the barbarians, when investi­ <lb/>
            gating the secrets of nature, have never been able to arrive at <lb/>
            a clear perception of even the most trivial circumstances; and <lb/>
            a clear proof of this assertion may be found in the disagree­ <lb/>
            ments, and dissensions, and contentions of those of each sect <lb/>
            who are seeking to establish their own opinions, and to over­ <lb/>
            throw those of their adversaries. And the households of those <lb/>
            who have been contending for the predominance of this and <lb/>
            that sect, have been the causes of universal wars, blinding the <lb/>
            human mind by their contradictory quarrels, which might <lb/>
            otherwise have been able to see the truth, and fighting hard <lb/>
            about what doctrines ought to be abandoned and what ought to <lb/>
            be preserved.</p>
          <p>Now he who desires to form to himself a conception of the <lb/>
            most excellent of all beings, ought in the first place to stand <lb/>
            firm in his mind, being steadfastly fixed in one opinion, and <lb/>
            not varying or wandering in different directions. And in the <lb/>
            next place, he ought to take his stand upon nature, and upon <lb/>
            solid grounds, and to abandon all barren and corruptible things, <lb/>
            for if anything of a somewhat effeminate character approach <lb/>
            him, he will be disappointed of his object, and he will be <lb/>
            unable, even if he exert the most acute faculties of sight <lb/>
            imaginable, to behold the uncreated God; so that he will <lb/>
            become blind before he sees him, on account of the brilliancy <lb/>
            of his beams and the flood of light which distils therefrom. Do <lb/>
            you not see that the power of fire in the case of those who <lb/>
            stand at a measured distance from it affords light to them, but <lb/>
            it burns those who approach too near? Take care that you do <lb/>
            not suffer such an injury as this in your mind, and lest an <lb/>
            extravagant desire of an impossible object destroy you.</p>

            and about unlawful ceremonies, or illicit mysteries.</p>
          <p>In the second place, they must be purified with all holy <lb/>
            purifications, both in soul and body, as far as it is allowed by <lb/>
            their national laws and customs. In the third place, they <lb/>
            must give credible evidence of their entering into the common <lb/>
            joy, so that they may not, after having partaken of the sacred <lb/>
            food, like intemperate youths, be changed by satiety and over­ <lb/>

          <p>The outward senses resemble windows; for through them, <lb/>
            as through windows, the comprehension of the objects of the <lb/>
            outward senses enters into the mind, and again through them <lb/>
            the mind goes out to investigate such objects. But the sight <lb/>
            is a part of these windows, that is to say, of the outward <lb/>
            senses, since above all others it is akin to the soul, because it <lb/>
            is nearly connected with the most beautiful of all things, <lb/>
            namely light, and is a servant of divine things ; and, indeed, <lb/>

            then immediately arrived at a due conception of God, and of <lb/>
            creation, and of providence; considering that the whole <lb/>
            nature of all things was not brought into existence of its own <lb/>

          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " You shall not eat <lb/>
            the flesh in the blood of the soul ?" * God appears by this <lb/>
            expression to intend to show that the blood is the essence of <lb/>
            the soul, that is to say, of the soul endowed with the outward <lb/>
            senses, not the soul spoken of in the most excellent sense of <lb/>
            the word, that is to say, as far as it is endued with reason and <lb/>
            intellect; for there are three divisions of the soul, one part <lb/>
            being nutritious, a second being endued with the outward <lb/>
            senses, and the third being endued with reason. Accordingly <lb/>
            the divine Spirit is the essence of the rational portion, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to the sacred historian of the creation of the world, for he <lb/>
            says that " God breathed into his face the breath of life."f <lb/>
            But of that part which is endued with the outward, senses, and <lb/>
            which has the revivifying power, blood is the essence, for he <lb/>
            says in another place that " the soul of all flesh is the blood ;”‡ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis is. 4. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis ii. 0. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Deuteronomy xii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            but what is connected with the flesh is the outward sense and <lb/>
            the passions, and not the mind and the intellect; not but <lb/>
            what that expression, " in the blood of the soul," also indicates <lb/>
            that the soul is one thing and the body another. So that in <lb/>
            real truth the breath is the essence of the soul, but it has not <lb/>
            any place of itself independently of the blood, but it resembles <lb/>
            and is combined with blood.</p>

          <p>A steadiness towards one's friends is a sign of a general <lb/>
            stability of disposition, on which account one ought not to <lb/>
            form friendship till one has carefully tested the characters of <lb/>
            those with whom he proposes to form it; for not only is the <lb/>
            forming of such friendship pleasant, but so also is the feeling <lb/>
            that one has not to bear by one's self burdens which oppress the <lb/>
            soul, and not to depart from the association; for he who is the <lb/>
            cause of differences in friendship is not known to the generality <lb/>
            of men, but he is accustomed to bring common blame upon <lb/>
            both parties, and very commonly on the innocent party more <lb/>
            than on the guilty one.</p>
          <p>Of secret things, you may share with mean persons those <lb/>

          <p>Why is it that God, when he threatens to extirpate man­ <lb/>

            days after its birth, what evil has it done so as to be subjected <lb/>
            to the punishment of death? Therefore some persons say <lb/>
            that the manner of the punishment is to be referred to its <lb/>

          <p>He shows most evidently that he is a proselyte, inasmuch as <lb/>
            he is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, but in the <lb/>
            pleasures and appetites, and all the other passions of the soul; <lb/>
            for the Hebrew race was not circumcised in Egypt, but being <lb/>

          <p>On this account Moses adds, " For you know the soul of a <lb/>

            things which are offered, but all things which are brought as a <lb/>

            one being to despise pleasure, for leaven is the seasoning of <lb/>

            self-conceit; for each is a wicked state, and pleasure and self- <lb/>
            conceit are both the offspring of one mother, deceit.</p>
          <p>The blood of the sacrifices is a proof of a soul making its <lb/>

          <p>Pillars symbolically mean the doctrines which appear to <lb/>

            the following.</p>
          <p>Some men pull down some things as if they meant to raise <lb/>
            them again, and destroy some things as if they meant at a <lb/>
            future time to re-establish them. But God wills that what <lb/>
            has been once destroyed and pulled down shall never be raised <lb/>
            or re-established again, but shall be utterly destroyed and for <lb/>
            ever, as being contrary to what is good or beautiful.</p>

            thought, out of their impiety or folly, that the motions of the <lb/>
            Deity were those of peace, and belonging to the act of <lb/>
            changing his abode; for behold he says expressly, not that the <lb/>
            God who exists in essence, and who is duly thought of in <lb/>
            respect of his existence, came down, but that his glory came <lb/>
            down. And the acceptation of the word glory may be twofold : <lb/>
            for in one sense it may signify the presence of his powers, <lb/>
            since the power of his army is spoken of as the glory of a <lb/>
            king ; and in another sense it may refer to the appearance of <lb/>
            him alone, and to the apprehension of his divine glory; so <lb/>
            that an idea of the actual arrival of God may have been <lb/>
            created in the minds of those who were present, as if he had <lb/>

            very like unto flame, or rather not that it is so, but that it <lb/>
            appears like it to the beholders; since God shows what he <lb/>
            chose to appear to be, in order to strike the beholders with <lb/>
            amazement without in reality being what he appeared. <lb/>
            Accordingly he brings him before the face of the children of <lb/>

            appearance as of flame, but not a real flame. But as flame <lb/>
            consumes every material which is exposed to it, so also when <lb/>
            the true conception of God once enters into the soul, it <lb/>
            destroys all the heterodox reasonings of impiety, and purifies <lb/>

          <p>Why does Moses, revolving and considering the creation of <lb/>
            the world, say: " This is the book of the generation of heaven <lb/>
            and earth, when they were created ? " t</p>
          <p>1. The expression, "when they were created," indicates as it <lb/>
            seems an indeterminate time not accurately described. But <lb/>
            this argument will confute those authors who calculate a <lb/>
            certain number of years reduced to one, from the time when it <lb/>
            is possible that the world may have been created.</p>
          <p>And again, the expression : " This is the book of tne gene­ <lb/>
            ration," is as it were indicative of the book as it follows, which <lb/>
            contains an account of the creation of the world; in which it is <lb/>
            intimated that what has been related about the creation of the <lb/>
            world is consistent with strict truth.</p>
          <p>What is the object of saying, “And God made every green <lb/>
            herb of the field, before it was upon the earth, and every grass <lb/>
            before it had sprung up ?" 1</p>
          <p>2. He here by these expressions intimates in enigmatical <lb/>
            language the incorporeal species; since the expression, " be­ <lb/>
            fore it was upon the earth," indicates the arriving at perfection <lb/>
            of every herb, and of all seeds and trees. But as to what he <lb/>
            says, that " before it had sprung up upon the earth," he had <lb/>
            made every green herb, and grass, et cætera, it is plain that the <lb/>
            incorporeal species, as being indicative of the others, were <lb/>
            created first, in accordance with intellectual nature, which <lb/>
            those things which are upon the earth perceptible to the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses were to imitate.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of saying: '' A fountain went up from <lb/>
            the earth, and watered all the face of the earth ?"§</p>
          <p>III. But here the question is how it could be that the whole <note type="footnote"> * This work is translated from a Latin version made by Aucher <lb/>
            from an Armenian version of the fifth century. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 4. </note><note type="footnote">1 Genesis ii. 5. </note><note type="footnote">§ Genesis ii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            earth was watered by one fountain, not only on account of its <lb/>
            size, but also because of the inequality of the montainous and <lb/>
            champaign situations ? Unless, indeed, just as the whole <lb/>
            force of the king's cavalry is called " the horse," so the whole <lb/>
            multitude of the veins of the earth which supply drinkable <lb/>
            water, may perhaps be called the fountain, inasmuch as they all <lb/>
            bubble up like a fountain.</p>
          <p>And that expression is peculiarly appropriate which says <lb/>
            that the fountain watered, not the whole earth, but its face; <lb/>
            as in the living being it waters the chief and predominant <lb/>
            part (the mind or the countenance). Since that is the most <lb/>
            important part of the earth which can be good and fertile and <lb/>
            productive, and that is the part which stands in need of the <lb/>
            nourishment of'fountains.</p>
          <p>What is the man who was created ? And how is that man <lb/>
            distinguished who was made after the image of God ?</p>
          <p>4. This man was created as perceptible to the senses, and <lb/>
            in the similitude of a Being appreciable only by the intellect; <lb/>
            but he who in respect of his form is intellectual and incorpo­ <lb/>
            real, is the similitude of the archetypal model as to appearance, <lb/>
            and he is the form of the principal character; but this is the <lb/>
            word of God, the first beginning of all things, the original <lb/>
            species or the archetypal idea, the first measure of the <lb/>
            universe.</p>
          <p>Moreover, that man who was to be created as a vessel is <lb/>
            formed by a potter, was formed out of dust and clay as far as <lb/>
            his body was concerned; but he received his soul by God <lb/>
            breathing the breath of life into his face, so that the tempera­ <lb/>
            ment of his nature was combined of what was corruptible and <lb/>
            of what was incorruptible. But the other man, he who is <lb/>
            only so in form, is found to be unalloyed without any mixture <lb/>
            proceeding from an invisible, simple, and transparent nature.</p>
          <p>Why is it said that God breathed into his face the breath of <lb/>
            life?</p>
          <p>5. In the first place because life is the principal part of <lb/>
            the body; for the rest was only made as a sort of foundation <lb/>
            or pedestal, and then life was put upon it as a statue. Besides, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis it 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            the sense is the fountain of the animal form, and sense resides <lb/>
            in the face.</p>
          <p>Secondly, man is created to be a partaker not only of a soul <lb/>
            but also of a rational soul ; and the head is the temple of the <lb/>
            reason, as some writers have called it.</p>
          <p>Why is God said to have planted a Paradise ? And for <lb/>
            whom ? And what is meant by a paradise ?</p>
          <p>6. The word paradise, if taken literally, has no need of any <lb/>
            particular explanation; for it means a place thickly crowded <lb/>
            with every kind of tree; but symbolically taken, it means <lb/>
            wisdom, intelligence both divine and human, and the proper <lb/>
            comprehension of the causes of things; since it was proper, <lb/>
            after the creation of the world, to establish a contemplative <lb/>
            system of life, in order that man, by the sight of the world <lb/>
            and of the things which are contained in it, might be able to <lb/>
            attain to a correct notion of the praise due to the Father.</p>
          <p>And since it was not possible for him to behold nature her­ <lb/>
            self, nor properly to praise the Creator of the universe without <lb/>
            wisdom, therefore the Creator planted the outline of it in the <lb/>
            rational soul of the principal guide of man, namely the mind, <lb/>
            as he planted trees in the paradise. And when we are told <lb/>
            that in the middle was the tree of life, that means the know­ <lb/>
            ledge not only of the creature, but also of the greater and <lb/>
            supreme cause of the universe ; for if any one is able to arrive <lb/>
            at a certain comprehension of that, he will be fortunate and <lb/>
            truly happy and immortal.</p>
          <p>Moreover, after the creation of the world human wisdom was <lb/>
            created, as also after the creation of the world the Paradise <lb/>
            was planted ; and so the poets say that the chorus of musicians <lb/>
            was established in order to praise the Creator and his works; <lb/>
            as Plato says, that the Creator was the first and greatest of <lb/>
            causes, and that the world was the most beautiful of all <lb/>
            creatures.</p>
          <p>Why in Adin, or Eden, is God said to have planted the <lb/>
            Paradise towards the east?*</p>
          <p>7. This is said in the first place because tne motion of <lb/>
            the world proceeds from the rising of the sun to its setting. <lb/>
            And it first exists in that quarter from which it is moved; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            secondly, because tnat part of the world which is in the region <lb/>
            of the east is called the right side; and that which is in the <lb/>
            region of the west is called the left side of the world.</p>
          <p>Moreover the poet bears witness to. this, calling the birds <lb/>
            from the east dextems or right, and those on the west sinis­ <lb/>
            tras or left; * when he says, whether they go to the right to <lb/>
            the day and to the sun, or whether they go to the left towards <lb/>
            the dusky evening.</p>
          <p>But the name Eden, when rightly understood, is an indica­ <lb/>
            tion of all kinds of delights, and joys, and pleasures; since all <lb/>
            good things and all blessings derive their beginning from the <lb/>
            place of the Lord. Thirdly, because wisdom itself is splendour <lb/>
            and light.</p>
          <p>Why did God place man whom be had created in the Para­ <lb/>
            dise, but not that man who is after his own image ?t</p>
          <p>8. Some persons have said, when they fancied that the <lb/>
            Paradise was a garden, that because the man who was created <lb/>
            was endowed with senses, therefore he naturally and properly <lb/>
            proceeded into a sensible place ; but the other man, who is <lb/>
            made after God's own image, being appreciable only by the <lb/>
            intellect, and invisible, had all the incorporeal species for his <lb/>
            share; but I should rather say that the paradise was a symbol <lb/>
            of wisdom, for that created man is a kind of mixture, as hav­ <lb/>
            ing been compounded of soul and body, having work to do by <lb/>
            learning and discipline; desiring according to the law of <lb/>
            philosophy that he may become happy; but he who is accord­ <lb/>
            ing to God's own image is in need of nothing, being by him- <note type="footnote">6 He is referring here to Homer—

              self a hearer, and being taught by himself, and being found to <lb/>
              be his own master by reason of his natural endowments.</p>
          <p>Why does Moses say that every tree in the Paradise was <lb/>
            beautiful to look upon and good to eat?*</p>
          <p>9. He says this because the virtue of trees is of a twofold <lb/>
            nature, consisting in bearing leaves and fruit, one of which <lb/>
            qualities is referred to the pleasing of the sight, the other to <lb/>
            the gratification of the taste ; but the word beautiful was not <lb/>
            employed inappropriately. Indeed it is very proper that the <lb/>
            plants should be always green and flourishing perpetually, as <lb/>
            belonging to a divine Paradise, which as such must be ever­ <lb/>
            lasting ; and it is fit too that they should never degenerate so <lb/>
            as to lose their leaves.</p>
          <p>But of the fruit he says, not that it was beautiful, but that <lb/>
            it was good, speaking in a very philosophical spirit; since <lb/>
            men take food, not only because of the pleasure which it <lb/>
            affords, but also because of its use; and use is the flowing forth <lb/>
            and imparting of some good.</p>
          <p>What is meant by the tree of life, and why it was placed in <lb/>
            the middle of the Paradise ?</p>
          <p>10. Some people have believed that, if there were really <lb/>
            plants of a corporeal and deadly nature, there are also some <lb/>
            which are causes of life and immortality, because, they say, <lb/>
            life and death are opposed to one another, and because some <lb/>
            plants are ascertained to be unwholesome, therefore of <lb/>
            necessity there must be others from which health may be <lb/>
            derived. But what these are which are wholesome they know <lb/>
            not; for generation, as the opinion of the wise has it, is the <lb/>
            beginning of corruption.</p>
          <p>But perhaps we ought to look on these things as spoken in <lb/>
            an allegorical sense; for some say the tree of life belongs to <lb/>
            the earth, inasmuch as it is the earth which produces every­ <lb/>
            thing which is of use for life, whether it be the life of mankind <lb/>
            or of any other animal; since God has appointed the situation <lb/>
            in the centre for this plant, and the centre of the universe is <lb/>
            the earth. There are others who assert that what is meant <lb/>
            by the tree of life is the centre between the seven circles of <lb/>
            heaven; but some affirm that it is the sun which is meant, as <lb/>
            that is nearly in the centre, between the different planets, and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            is likewise the cause of the four seasons, and since it is owing <lb/>
            to him that every thing which exists is called into existence.</p>
          <p>Others again understand by the tree of life the direction of <lb/>
            the soul, for this it is which renders the sense nervous and solid, <lb/>
            so as to produce actions corresponding to its nature, and to the <lb/>
            community of the parts of the body. But whatever is in the <lb/>
            middle is in a manner the primary cause and beginning of <lb/>
            things, like the leader of a chorus. But still, the best and <lb/>
            wisest authorities have considered that by the tree of life is <lb/>
            indicated the best of all the virtues of man, piety, by which <lb/>
            alone the mind attains to immortality.</p>
          <p>What is meant by the tree of the knowledge of good and <lb/>
            evil?*</p>
          <p>11. This indeed exhibits that meaning which is sought for <lb/>
            in the letter of the Scriptures more clearly to the sight, as it <lb/>
            bears a manifest allegory on the face of it. What is meant <lb/>
            then under this figure is prudence, which is the comprehension <lb/>
            of science, by which all things are known and distinguished <lb/>
            from one another, whether they be good and beautiful, or bad <lb/>
            and unseemly, or in short every sort of contrariety is discerned; <lb/>
            since some things belong to the better class, and some to the <lb/>
            worse.</p>
          <p>Therefore the wisdom which exists in this world is not in <lb/>
            truth God himself, but the work of God; that it is which sees <lb/>
            and thoroughly investigates every thing. But the wisdom <lb/>
            which exists in man sees in an incorrect and mixed manner <lb/>
            with somewhat darkened eyes; for it is found to be in­ <lb/>
            competent to see and comprehend clearly and without alloy <lb/>
            each particular thing separately. Moreover, there is a kind of <lb/>
            deception mingled with human wisdom ; since very often there <lb/>
            are some shadows found which hinder the eyes from contem­ <lb/>
            plating a brilliant light; since what the eye is in the body, <lb/>
            such also is the mind and wisdom in the soul.</p>
          <p>What the river is which proceeded out of Adin by which the <lb/>
            Paradise is watered, and from which the four rivers proceed, <lb/>
            the Phison, and the Gihon, and the Tigris, and the Euphrates ?</p>
          <p>IS. The sources of the Deglath and of the Arazania, that is <lb/>
            to say of the Tigris and Euphrates, are said to arise in the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 9. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis ii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> U </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            mountains of Armenia; but there is no paradise there at <lb/>
            this day, nor do both the sources of both these rivers remain <lb/>
            there. Perhaps, therefore, we ought to consider that the <lb/>
            real situation of the Paradise is in a place at a distance from <lb/>
            this part of the world which we inhabit, and that it has a <lb/>
            river running beneath the earth, which pours forth many <lb/>
            veins of the largest size; so that they, rising up together, <lb/>
            pour themselves forth into other veins, which receive them <lb/>
            on account of their great size, and then those have been <lb/>
            suppressed by the gulfs of the waves; on which account, <lb/>
            through the impulse given to them by the violence which is <lb/>
            implanted in them, they burst out on the face of the earth <lb/>
            in other places, and also among others in the mountains of <lb/>
            Armenia. Therefore, those things which have been ac­ <lb/>
            counted the sources of the rivers, are rather their flowing <lb/>
            course; or again, they may be said to be correctly looked <lb/>
            upon as sources, because by all means we must consider the <lb/>
            holy scriptures infallible, which point out the fact of four <lb/>
            rivers ; for the river is the beginning, and not the spring.</p>
          <p>But perhaps this passage also contains an allegorical <lb/>
            meaning; for the four rivers are the signs of four virtues: <lb/>
            Phison being the sign of prudence, as deriving its name from <lb/>
            parsimony;* and Gihon being the sign of sobriety, as having <lb/>
            its employment in the regulation of meat and drink, and as <lb/>
            restraining the appetites of the belly, and of those parts which <lb/>
            are below the belly, as being earthly; the Tigris again is the <lb/>
            sign of fortitude, for this it is which regulates the raging <lb/>
            commotion of anger within us; and the Euphrates is the <lb/>
            sign of justice, since there is nothing in which the thoughts <lb/>
            of men exult more than in justice.</p>
          <p>Why it is that he not only describes the situation of'tne <lb/>
            Euphrates, but also says that the Phison goes round all the <lb/>
            land of Evilat, and thai the Gihon goes round all the land of <lb/>
            Ethiopia, and that the Tigris goes toward Assyria ?f</p>
          <p>13. The Tigris is a very cruel and mischievous river, as <lb/>
            the citizens of Babylon bear witness, and so do the magi, <lb/>
            who have found it to be of a character quite different from <lb/>
            the nature of other rivers; however they might also have <lb/>
            another reason for looking on it with aversion. <note type="footnote"> * From. <foreign xml:lang="grc">φειδὼ</foreign>, “parsimony.” </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis ii. </note> <pb n="291"/>
            </p>
          <p>But the Euphrates is a gentler, and more salubrious, and <lb/>
            more nourishing stream. On which account, the wise men <lb/>
            of the Hebrews and Assyrians speak of it as one which <lb/>
            increases and extends itself; and on this account it is not <lb/>
            here characterised by its connection with other things, as <lb/>
            the other three rivers are, but by itself.</p>
          <p>My own opinion is, that these expressions are all symbol­ <lb/>
            ical, for prudence is the virtue of the rational part of man ; <lb/>
            and it is in this that wickedness is sometimes found. And <lb/>
            fortitude is that portion of the human character which is <lb/>
            liable to degenerate into anger. And sobriety, again, may <lb/>
            be impaired by the desires, but anger and concupiscence are <lb/>
            the characteristics of beasts; therefore the sacred historian <lb/>
            has here described those three rivers by the places which <lb/>
            they flow round. But he has not described the Euphrates <lb/>
            in that manner, as being the symbol of justice, for there is <lb/>
            no certain and limited portion of it allotted to the soul, but <lb/>
            a perfect harmony of the three parts of the soul and of the <lb/>
            three virtues is possessed by it.</p>
          <p>Why God placed man in the Paradise with a twofold <lb/>
            object, namely, that he might both till it and keep it, when <lb/>
            the Paradise was in reality in need of no cultivation, because <lb/>
            it was perfect in everything, as having been planted by <lb/>
            God; nor, again, did it require a keeper, for who was there <lb/>
            to ravage it ? *</p>
          <p>14. These are the two objects which a cultivation of the land <lb/>
            must attain to and take care of, the cultivation of the land <lb/>
            and the safe keeping of the things which are in it, otherwise <lb/>
            it will be spoiled by laziness or else by devastation. But <lb/>
            although the Paradise did not stand in need of these <lb/>
            exertions, nevertheless it was proper that he who had the <lb/>
            regulation and care of it committed to him, namely, the first <lb/>
            man, should be as it were a sort of pattern and law to all <lb/>
            workmen in future of everything which ought to be done by <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Moreover it was suitable that, though all the Paradise was <lb/>
            full of everything, it should still leave the cultivator some <lb/>
            grounds for care, and some means of displaying his industry; <lb/>
            for instance, by digging around it, and tending it, and soften­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> U 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            ing it, and digging trenches, and irrigating it by water; and <lb/>
            it was needful to attend to its safety, although there was <lb/>
            no one to lay it waste, because of the wild beasts, also more <lb/>
            especially in respect of the air and water; as, for instance, <lb/>
            when a drought prevailed, to irrigate it with a plenteous <lb/>
            supply of water, and in moister weather to check the super­ <lb/>
            abundance of moisture by directing the course of the streams <lb/>
            in other directions.</p>
          <p>Why, when God commanded the man to eat of every tree <lb/>
            within the Paradise, he speaks in the singular number, and <lb/>
            says, " Thou shalt eat;" but when he commands that he <lb/>
            shall abstain from the tree which would give him the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of good and evil, he speaks in the plural number, and <lb/>
            says, " Te shall not eat of it, for in the day in which ye eat <lb/>
            of it ye shall surely die ?" *</p>
          <p>15. In the first place he uses this language because one <lb/>
            good was derived from many; and that also is not unim­ <lb/>
            portant in these principles, since he who has done anything <lb/>
            which is of utility is one, and he who attains to anything <lb/>
            useful is also one; but when I say one, I am speaking not <lb/>
            of that which in point of number comes before duality, but <lb/>
            of that one creative virtue by which many beings rightly <lb/>
            coalesce, and by their concord imitate singularity, as a flock, <lb/>
            a herd, a troop, a chorus, an army, a nation, a tribe, a family, <lb/>
            a state; for all these things being many members form one <lb/>
            community, being united by affection as by a kiss; when <lb/>
            things which are not combined, and which have no principle <lb/>
            of union by reason of their duality and multitude, fall into <lb/>
            different divisions, for duality is the beginning of discord.</p>
          <p>But two men living as if they were one, by the same <lb/>
            philosophy, practise an unalloyed and brilliant virtue, which <lb/>
            is free from all taint of wickedness; but where good and <lb/>
            evil are mingled together the combination contains the <lb/>
            principle of death.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Ye shall surely <lb/>
            die ?"t</p>
          <p>16. The death of the good is the beginning of another <lb/>
            life; for life is a twofold thing, one life being in the body, <note type="footnote"> I Genesis ii. 16. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis ii. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            corruptible; the other without the body, incorruptible. <lb/>
            Therefore one wicked mail surely dies the death, who while <lb/>
            still breathing and among the living is in reality long since <lb/>
            buried, so as to retain in himself no single spark of real life, <lb/>
            which is perfect virtue. But a good man, who deserves so <lb/>
            high a title, does not surely die, but has his life prolonged, <lb/>
            and so attains to an eternal end.</p>
          <p>Why God says, " It is not good for man to be alone ; let <lb/>
            us make him a help meet for him ?"*</p>
          <p>17. By these words God intimates that there is to be a <lb/>
            communion, not with all men, but with those who are <lb/>
            willing to be assisted and in their turn to assist others, even <lb/>
            though they may scarcely have any power to do so; since <lb/>
            love consists not more in utility than in the harmonious <lb/>
            concord of trustworthy and steadfast manners; so that <lb/>
            every one who joins in a communion of love may be entitled <lb/>
            to utter the expression of Pythagoras, " A friend is another <lb/>
            I."</p>
          <p>Why, when God had already said, " Let us make a help <lb/>
            for man," he creates beasts and cattle ?f</p>
          <p>18. Perhaps some gluttons and insatiably greedy persons <lb/>
            may say that God did this because beasts and flying things <lb/>
            were, as it were, necessary food for man, and his meetest <lb/>
            helper; for that the eating of meat assists the belly so as to <lb/>
            conduce to the health and vigour of the body. But I should <lb/>
            think that by reason of the evil implanted in them by <lb/>
            nature animals of all kinds, whether terrestrial or flying in <lb/>
            the air, were in this age hostile to and contrary to man; but <lb/>
            that in the case of the first man, as one adorned with every <lb/>
            imaginable virtue, they were, as it were, allies, and a rein­ <lb/>
            forcement in war, and familiar friends, as being tame and <lb/>
            domestic by nature, and this was the sole principle of their <lb/>
            familiarity with man, for this it was fit that servants should <lb/>
            dwell with their lord.</p>
          <p>Why the creation of animals and flying creatures is men­ <lb/>
            tioned a second time, when the account of their creation had <lb/>
            already been given in the history of the six days ?</p>
          <p>19. Perhaps those things which were created in the six <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 18. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis ii J 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            days were incorporeal angels, indicated under these symbol­ <lb/>
            ical expressions, being the appearances of terrestrial and <lb/>
            flying animals, but now they were produced in reality, being <lb/>
            the copies of what had been created before, images per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the outward senses of invisible models.</p>
          <p>Why did God bring every animal to man, that he might <lb/>
            give them their names ?#</p>
          <p>20. He has here explained a great source of perplexity to <lb/>
            the students of philosophy, admonishing them that names <lb/>
            proceed from having been given, and not from nature; for a <lb/>
            natural nomenclature is with peculiar fitness assigned to <lb/>
            each creature when a man of wisdom and pre-eminent <lb/>
            knowledge appears; and, in fact, the office of assigning the <lb/>
            names to animals is one which particularly belongs to the <lb/>
            mind of the wise man alone, and indeed to the first man <lb/>
            born out of the earth, since it was fitting that the first of <lb/>
            the human race, and the sovereign of all the animals born <lb/>
            out of the earth, should have the dignity assigned to him.</p>
          <p>For inasmuch as he was the first person to see the animals, <lb/>
            and as he was the first person who deserved to govern them <lb/>
            all as their chief, so also it was fitting that he should be <lb/>
            their first namer and the inventor of their names, since it <lb/>
            would have been inconsistent and mad to leave them with­ <lb/>
            out any names, or to allow them to receive names from any <lb/>
            one born at a later period, which would have been an insult <lb/>
            to and a derogation from the honour and glory due to the <lb/>
            first born.</p>
          <p>But we may also adopt this idea, that the giving of names <lb/>
            to the different animals was so easily arranged that the very <lb/>
            moment that Adam gave the name the animal itself also <lb/>
            heard it; being influenced by the name thus given to it as <lb/>
            by a familiar indication closely connected with it.</p>
          <p>Why Moses says, " He brought the animals to Adam, <lb/>
            that he might see what he would call them," when God can <lb/>
            never entertain a doubt ?f</p>
          <p>21. It is in truth inconsistent with the nature of God to <lb/>
            doubt; therefore it does not appear that he was in doubt on <lb/>
            this occasion, but that since be had given intellect to man <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 19. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            as being the first man born out of the earth and endowed <lb/>
            with a great desire for virtue, by which he was made <lb/>
            thoroughly wise as if he had been endowed with wisdom by <lb/>
            nature, so as to consider all things like the proper Ruler <lb/>
            and Lord of all, God now caused him to be influenced to <lb/>
            display the proper performance of his task, and saw what <lb/>
            was really the most excellent point of his mind.</p>
          <p>Besides this, by this statement he evidently indicates the <lb/>
            perfect free-will existing in us, refuting those who affirm <lb/>
            that everything exists by a certain necessity.</p>
          <p>Or else because it belonged to man to employ the animals, <lb/>
            therefore he also gave him authority to give them names.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And whatever <lb/>
            he called each living thing, that was the name thereof ?"</p>
          <p>22. We must consider that Adam gave names not only to <lb/>
            all living creatures, but also to plants, and to everything <lb/>
            else which is inanimate, beginning with the more excellent <lb/>
            class; for the living creature is superior to that which has <lb/>
            not life. Therefore the scripture considers the mention of <lb/>
            the better part sufficient, indicating by this mention to all <lb/>
            who are not utterly devoid of sense, that he in fact gave <lb/>
            names to everything, since it was easy to fix names to things <lb/>
            without life, which were never likely to change their place, <lb/>
            and which had no passions of the soul to exercise, but the <lb/>
            giving of proper appellations to living creatures was a more <lb/>
            difficult task on account of the motions of their bodies and <lb/>
            the various impulses of their souls, in accordance with <lb/>
            imagination and the variety of the outward senses, and the <lb/>
            different agitations of the mind from which the effects of <lb/>
            their works proceed. Therefore the mind could give names to <lb/>
            the more difficult classes of living creatures. And on this <lb/>
            account it was a very proper expression to employ, that he <lb/>
            gave them names as being easy to name, because they were <lb/>
            near.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression: “But for Adam <lb/>
            there was not found a helper like to him ?"*</p>
          <p>23. Every thing was helping and assisting the prince of <lb/>
            the human race: the earth, the rivers, the sea, the air, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            light, the heaven. Moreover, every species of fruit and <lb/>
            plant co-operated with him, and every herd of cattle, and <lb/>
            every beast which was not savage. Nevertheless, of all <lb/>
            these things which were assisting him, there was nothing <lb/>
            like himself, inasmuch as they were none of them human <lb/>
            beings. Therefore, God gave a certain indication that he <lb/>
            might show that man ought to be an assistant to and co­ <lb/>
            operator with man, being endowed with perfect similarity to <lb/>
            one another in both body and soul.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " And God sent <lb/>
            a trance upon Adam, and caused him to sleep ?"*</p>
          <p>24. How it is that man sleeps is a question which has <lb/>
            caused an extraordinary amount of perplexity to philo­ <lb/>
            sophers. But yet our prophet has distinctly explained this <lb/>
            question; for sleep is in itself properly a trance, not of that <lb/>
            kind which is more nearly allied to insanity, but of that <lb/>
            which is in accordance with the dissolution of the senses <lb/>
            and the absence of counsel; for then the senses withdraw <lb/>
            from those things which are their proper object, and the <lb/>
            intellect withdraws from the senses, not strengthening their <lb/>
            nerves, nor giving any motion to those parts which have <lb/>
            received the power of action, inasmuch as they are with­ <lb/>
            drawn from the objects perceptible by the outward senses.</p>
          <p>What the rib is which God took from the man whom he <lb/>
            had formed out of the earth, and which he made into a <lb/>
            woman ?</p>
          <p>25. The letter of this statement is plain enough; for it is <lb/>
            expressed according to a symbol of the part, a half of the <lb/>
            whole, each party, the man and the woman, being as sections <lb/>
            of nature co-equal for the production of that genus which is <lb/>
            called man. But with respect to the mind, man is under­ <lb/>
            stood in a symbolical manner, and his. one rib is virtue, <lb/>
            proceeding from the senses; but woman, who is the sensation <lb/>
            of counsel, will be more variable.</p>
          <p>But some think that the rib means valour and vigour, on <lb/>
            which account men call a boxer who has strong loins <lb/>
            eminently strong.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the lawgiver relates that the woman was <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            formed out of the rib of the man, indicating by that expres­ <lb/>
            sion, that one half of the body of the man is woman. And <lb/>
            this is testified to by the formation of the body, by the way <lb/>
            in which it is put together, by its motions and vigour, by <lb/>
            the force of the soul, and its strength; for all things are <lb/>
            regarded as in a twofold light; since, as the formation of the <lb/>
            man is more perfect, and, if one may so say, more double <lb/>
            than the formation of the woman, so also it required half the <lb/>
            time, that is to say forty days ; when, for the imperfect, and, <lb/>
            if I may so call it, half section of the man, that is to say the <lb/>
            woman, there was need of a double allowance, that is to say, <lb/>
            of eighty days, so that the doubling of the time required for <lb/>
            the nature of the man might be changed, in order to the <lb/>
            formation of the peculiar properties of the woman; for that <lb/>
            body, and that soul, the nature of which is in a twofold ratio, <lb/>
            the body and soul, that is, of the man, require but half of <lb/>
            the delineation and formation: but that body of which the <lb/>
            nature and construction is in the ratio of one half, namely, <lb/>
            that of the woman, her formation and delineation is in a <lb/>
            twofold ratio.</p>
          <p>Why Moses calls the form of the woman a building ?*</p>
          <p>26. The union and plenitude of concord formed by the <lb/>
            man and woman is symbolically called a house; but every <lb/>
            thing is altogether imperfect and destitute of a home, which <lb/>
            is deserted by a woman; for to the man the public affairs of <lb/>
            the state are committed, but the particular affairs of the <lb/>
            house belong to the woman; and a want of the woman will <lb/>
            be the destruction of the house; but the actual presence of <lb/>
            the woman shows the regulation of the house.</p>
          <p>Why, as other animals and as man also was made, the <lb/>
            woman was not also made out of the earth, but out of the <lb/>
            rib of the man ?</p>
          <p>27. This was so ordained in the first place, in order that <lb/>
            the woman might not be of equal dignity with the man. In <lb/>
            the second place, that she might not be of equal age with <lb/>
            him, but younger; since those who marry wives more <lb/>
            advanced in years than themselves deserve blame, as having <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 22. The margin of our bible points out that the <lb/>
            Hebrew word translated “made,” means strictly “builded.” </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            overturned the law of nature. Thirdly, the design of God <lb/>
            was, that the husband should take care of his wife, as of a <lb/>
            necessary part of himself; but that the woman should <lb/>
            requite him in turn with service, as a portion of the <lb/>
            universe. In the fourth place, he admonishes mail by this <lb/>
            enigmatical intimation, that he should take care of his wife <lb/>
            as of his daughter; and he admonishes the woman that she <lb/>
            should honour her husband as her father. And very rightly, <lb/>
            since the woman changes her habitation, passing from her <lb/>
            own offspring to her husband. On which account, it is <lb/>
            altogether right and proper that he who has received should <lb/>
            take upon himself the liability in respect of what has been <lb/>
            given; and that she who has been removed should worthily <lb/>
            give the same honour to her husband which she has pre­ <lb/>
            viously given to her parents; for the husband receives his <lb/>
            wife from her parents, as a deposit which is entrusted to <lb/>
            him; and the woman receives her husband from the law.</p>
          <p>Why, when the man saw the woman who had been formed <lb/>
            in this manner, he proceeded to say: "She" (or "this," <foreign xml:lang="grc">του̃το</foreign>) <lb/>
            " is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh: she shall <lb/>
            be called woman, because she has been taken out of man?"*</p>
          <p>28. He might have been amazed at what he had seen, and <lb/>
            have said in a negative manner: How can this exquisite <lb/>
            and desirable beauty have been derived from bones and from <lb/>
            flesh which are endowed with neither beauty nor elegance, <lb/>
            being of a form so far more beautiful, and endowed with <lb/>
            such excessive life and grace ? The matter is incredible <lb/>
            because she is like; and yet it is credible, because God him­ <lb/>
            self has been her creator and painter.</p>
          <p>Again, he might have said affirmatively: Truly she is a <lb/>
            living being, my bone and my flesh, for she exists by having <lb/>
            been taken from that bone and flesh of mine. But he <lb/>
            makes mention of his bone and flesh in a very natural <lb/>
            manner; for the human or corporeal tabernacle is the com­ <lb/>
            bination of bones, and flesh, and entrails, and veins, and <lb/>
            nerves, and ligaments, and blood-vessels, and breathing <lb/>
            tubes, and blood. And she is called woman (in Greek <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνη̃</foreign>) with great correctness, as the power of producing <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 23. Woman, virgo, or virago, is here looked upon as <lb/>
            derived from vir, “man ;” he also derives <foreign xml:lang="grc">γυνὴ</foreign>) from <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεννάω</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            with fertility, either because she becomes pregnant through <lb/>
            the reception of the seed, and so brings forth; or, as the <lb/>
            prophet says, because'she was made out of man, not out <lb/>
            of the earth, as he was; nor from seed, as all mankind after <lb/>
            them; but of a certain intermediate nature; and like a <lb/>
            branch, brought out of one vine to produce another vine.</p>
          <p>Why he says, " Therefore shall a man leave his father <lb/>
            and his mother, and cleave to his wife, and they shall be two <lb/>
            in one flesh ?”*</p>
          <p>29. He here orders man to behave himself towards his <lb/>
            wife with such excess of affection in their intercourse, that <lb/>
            he is willing to leave his parents, not in order that by that <lb/>
            means it may be more suitable, but as they would scarcely <lb/>
            be a motive for his fidelity to his wife. And we must <lb/>
            remark, that it is very excellent and prudently done, that he <lb/>
            has avoided saying that the woman is to leave her parents <lb/>
            and cleave to her husband, since the character of the man is <lb/>
            bolder than the nature of the woman; but he says that the <lb/>
            man ought to do this for the sake of the woman; for he is <lb/>
            borne on by a cheerful and willing impulse to the concord <lb/>
            of knowledge, to which, becoming wholly devoted, he re­ <lb/>
            strains and regulates his desires, and clings to his wife alone <lb/>
            like bird-lime. Especially because he himself, delighting in <lb/>
            his master-like authority, is to be respected for his pride: <lb/>
            but the woman, being in the rank of a servant, is praised, <lb/>
            for assenting to a life of communion.</p>
          <p>And when it is said that the two are one flesh, that indi­ <lb/>
            cates that the flesh is very tangible and fully endowed with <lb/>
            outward senses, on which it depends to be afflicted with <lb/>
            pain and delighted with pleasure, so that both the man and <lb/>
            woman may derive pleasure and pain from the same sources, <lb/>
            and may feel the same; aye, and may still more think the <lb/>
            same.</p>
          <p>Why both of them, the man and the woman, are said to <lb/>
            have been naked, and not to have been ashamed ?†</p>
          <p>30. They were not ashamed, in the first place, because <lb/>
            they were in the neighbourhood of the world, and the <lb/>
            different parts of the world are all naked, each of them <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 24. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis ii. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            indicating some peculiar qualities, and having peculiar <lb/>
            coverings of their own. In the second place, on account of <lb/>
            the sincerity and simplicity of their manners and of their <lb/>
            natural disposition, which had no taint of pride about it. <lb/>
            For ambition had as yet no existence. Thirdly, because the <lb/>
            climate and the mildness of the atmosphere was a sufficient <lb/>
            covering for them, so as to prevent either cold or heat from <lb/>
            hurting them. In the fourth place, because they, by reason <lb/>
            of the relationship existing between themselves and the <lb/>
            world, could not receive injury from any part of it whatever, <lb/>
            as being related to them.</p>
          <p>Why does Moses say that the serpent was more cunning <lb/>
            than all the beasts of the field ?*</p>
          <p>31. One may probably affirm with truth that the ser. <lb/>
            pent in reality is more cunning than any beast whatever. <lb/>
            But the reason why he appears to me to be spoken of in <lb/>
            these terms here is on account of the natural proneness of <lb/>
            mankind to vice, of which he is the symbol. And by vice I <lb/>
            mean concupiscence, inasmuch as those who are devoted to <lb/>
            pleasure are more cunning, and are the inventors of stra­ <lb/>
            tagems and means by which to indulge their passions. Being, <lb/>
            forsooth, very crafty in devising plans, both such as favour <lb/>
            pleasure and also such as procure means of enjoying it. <lb/>
            But it appears to me that since that animal, so superior in <lb/>
            wisdom, was about to seduce man, it is not the whole race <lb/>
            that is here meant to be spoken of as so exceedingly wise, <lb/>
            but only that single serpent, for the reason above mentioned.</p>
          <p>Did the serpent speak with a human voice ?†</p>
          <p>32. In the first place, it may be the fact that at the <lb/>
            beginning of the world even the other animals besides man <lb/>
            were not entirely destitute of the power of articulate speech, <lb/>
            but only that man excelled them in a greater fluency and <lb/>
            perspicuity of speech and language. In the second place, <lb/>
            when anything very marvellous requires to be done, God <lb/>
            changes the subject natures by which he means to operate. <lb/>
            Thirdly, because our soul is entirely filled with many errors, <lb/>
            and rendered deaf to all words except in one or two lan­ <lb/>
            guages to which it is accustomed; but the souls of those who <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 1. </note><note type="footnote">f Genesis iii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            were first created were rendered acute to thoroughly under­ <lb/>
            stand every voice of every kind, in order that they might be <lb/>
            pure from evil and wholly unpolluted. Since we indeed are <lb/>
            not endowed with senses in such perfection, for those which <lb/>
            we have received are in some degree depraved, just as the <lb/>
            construction of our bodies too is small; but the first created <lb/>
            men, as they received bodies of vast size reaching to a <lb/>
            gigantic Leight, must also of necessity have received more <lb/>
            accurate senses, and, what is more excellent still, a power of <lb/>
            examining into and hearing things in a philosophical manner. <lb/>
            For some people think, and perhaps with some reason, that <lb/>
            they were endowed with such eyes as enabled them to <lb/>
            behold even those natures, and essences, and operations, <lb/>
            which exist in heaven, as also ears by which they could <lb/>
            comprehend every kind of voice and language.</p>
          <p>Why did the serpent accost the woman, and not the man ?*</p>
          <p>33. The serpent, having formed his estimate of virtue, <lb/>
            devised a treacherous stratagem against them, for the sake <lb/>
            of bringing mortality on them. But the woman was more <lb/>
            accustomed to be deceived than the man. For his counsels <lb/>
            as well as his body are of a masculine sort, and competent <lb/>
            to disentangle the notions of seduction; but the mind of <lb/>
            the woman is more effeminate, so that through her softness <lb/>
            she easily yields and is easily caught by the persuasions of <lb/>
            falsehood, which imitate the resemblance of truth.</p>
          <p>Since therefore, in his old age, the serpentt strips himself <lb/>
            of his scales from the top of his head to his tail, he, by his <lb/>
            nakedness, reproaches man because he has exchanged death <lb/>
            for immortality. His nature is renewed by the beast, and <lb/>
            made to resemble every time. The woman, when she sees <lb/>
            this, is deceived; when she ought rather to have looked <lb/>
            upon him as an example, who, while showing his ingenuity <lb/>
            towards her, was full of devices, but she was led to desire <lb/>
            to acquire a life which should be free from old age, and <lb/>
            from all decay. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> + The ancients believed that the serpent became young again by <lb/>
            casting his skin. Ovid says— <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>Why the serpent tells the woman lies, saying, " God has <lb/>
            said, Ye shall not eat of every tree in the Paradise," when, <lb/>
            on the contrary, what God really had said was, " Ye shall <lb/>
            eat of every tree in the Paradise, except one ? ”*</p>
          <p>34. It is the custom for contending arguers to speak <lb/>
            falsely in an artful manner, in order to produce ignorance of <lb/>
            the real facts, as was done in this case, since the man and <lb/>
            woman had been commanded to eat of all the trees but one. <lb/>
            But this insidious prompter of wickedness coming in, says <lb/>
            that the order which they had received was that they should <lb/>
            not eat of them all. He brought forward an ambiguous <lb/>
            statement as a slippery stumbling-block to cause the soul to <lb/>
            trip. For this expression, “Ye shall not eat of every tree," <lb/>
            means in the first place either, not even of one, which is <lb/>
            false; or, secondly, not of every one, as if he intended to <lb/>
            say, there are some of which you may not eat, which is <lb/>
            true. Therefore he asserts such a falsehood more explicitly.</p>
          <p>Why, when it was commanded them to avoid eating of <lb/>
            one plant alone, the woman made also a further addition to <lb/>
            this injunction, saying, “He said, Ye shall not eat of it, <lb/>
            neither shall ye touch it ? "t</p>
          <p>35. In the first place she says this, because taste and <lb/>
            every other sense after its kind consists in the touch appro­ <lb/>
            priate to it. In the second place she says it that it may <lb/>
            seem to condemn them themselves, who did what they had <lb/>
            been forbidden. For if even the mere act of touching it <lb/>
            was prohibited, how could they who, besides touching the <lb/>
            tree, presumed to eat of the fruit, and so added a greater <lb/>
            transgression to the lesser one, be anything but condemners <lb/>
            and punishers of themselves ?</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Ye shall be as <lb/>
            gods, knowing good and evil? ”‡</p>
          <p>36. Whence was it that the serpent found the plural <lb/>
            word " gods," when there is only one true God, and when <lb/>
            this is the first time that he names him ? But perhaps <lb/>
            this arises from there having been in him a certain prescient <lb/>
            wisdom, by which he now declared the notion of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude of gods which was at a future time to prevail amongst <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 4. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis iii, 3. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis iii. 5 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            men; and, perhaps, history now relates this correctly at its <lb/>
            first being advanced not by any rational being, nor by any <lb/>
            creature of the higher class, but as having derived its origin <lb/>
            from the most virulent and vile of beasts and serpents, <lb/>
            since other similar creatures lie hid under the earth, and <lb/>
            their lurking places are in the holes and fissures of the <lb/>
            earth.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it is the inseparable sign of a being endowed <lb/>
            with reason to look upon God as essentially one being, but <lb/>
            it is the mark of a beast to imagine that there are many <lb/>
            gods, and these too devoid of reason, and who can scarcely <lb/>
            be said with propriety to have any existence at all.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the devil proceeds with great art, speaking by <lb/>
            the mouth of the serpent. For not only is there in the <lb/>
            Divinity the knowledge of good and evil, but there is also an <lb/>
            approval of what is good and a repudiation of what is evil; <lb/>
            but he does not speak of either of these feelings because <lb/>
            they were useful, but only suggested the mere knowledge of <lb/>
            the two contrary things, namely, of good and evil. In the <lb/>
            second place, the expression, " as gods," in the plural <lb/>
            number, is in this place not used inconsiderately, but in <lb/>
            order to give the idea of there being both a bad and a good <lb/>
            God. And these are of a twofold quality. Therefore it is <lb/>
            suitable to the notion of particular gods to have a know­ <lb/>
            ledge of contrary things; but the Supreme Cause is above <lb/>
            all others.</p>
          <p>Why the woman first touched the tree and ate of its <lb/>
            fruit, and the man afterwards, receiving it from her ?*</p>
          <p>37. The words used first of all, by their own intrinsic <lb/>
            force, assert that it was suitable that immortality and every <lb/>
            good thing should be represented as under the power of the <lb/>
            man, and death and every evil under that of the woman. <lb/>
            But with reference to the mind, the woman, when under­ <lb/>
            stood symbolically, is sense, and the man is intellect. More­ <lb/>
            over, the outward senses do of necessity touch those things <lb/>
            which are perceptible by them ; but it is through the medium <lb/>
            of the outward senses that things are transmitted to the <lb/>
            mind. For the outward senses are influenced by the objects <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            which are presented to them; and the intellect by the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And she gave <lb/>
            it to her husband to eat with her ? "*</p>
          <p>38. What has been just said bears on this point also, <lb/>
            since the time is nearly one and the same in which the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses are influenced by the object which is presented <lb/>
            to them, and the intellect has an impression made on it by <lb/>
            the outward senses.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And the eyes <lb/>
            of both of them were opened ? "t</p>
          <p>39. That they were not created blind is manifest even <lb/>
            from this fact that as all other things, both animals and <lb/>
            plants, were created in perfection, so also man must have <lb/>
            been adorned with the things which are his most excellent <lb/>
            parts, namely, eyes. And we may especially prove this, <lb/>
            because a little while before the earth-born Adam was giving <lb/>
            names to all the animals on the earth. Therefore it is per­ <lb/>
            fectly plain that he saw them before doing so. Unless, <lb/>
            indeed, Moses used the expression " eyes" in a figurative <lb/>
            sense for the vision of the soul, by which alone the percep­ <lb/>
            tion of good and evil, of what is elegant or unsightly, and, in <lb/>
            fact, of all contrary natures, arise. But, if the eye is to be <lb/>
            taken separately as counsel, which is called the warning of <lb/>
            the understanding, then again there is a separate eye, which <lb/>
            is a certain something devoid of sound reason, which is <lb/>
            called opinion.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Because they <lb/>
            knew that they were naked ? "t</p>
          <p>40. They first arrived at the knowledge of this fact, that <lb/>
            is to say, of their nakedness, after they had eaten of the <lb/>
            forbidden fruit. Therefore, opinion was like the beginning <lb/>
            of wickedness, when they perceived that they had not as yet <lb/>
            used any covering, inasmuch as all parts of the universe are <lb/>
            immortal and incorruptible; but they themselves imme­ <lb/>
            diately found themselves in need of some corruptible cover­ <lb/>
            ings made with hands. But this knowledge was in the <note type="footnote"> I Genesis iii. 6. </note><note type="footnote">f Genesis iii. 7. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            nakedness itself, not as having been in itself the cause of <lb/>
            any change, but because their mind now conceived a novelty <lb/>
            unlike the rest of the universal world.</p>
          <p>Why they sewed fig-leaves into girdles ?*</p>
          <p>41. They did this in the first place, because the fruit of <lb/>
            the fig is very pleasant and agreeable to the taste. There­ <lb/>
            fore the sacred historian here, by a symbolical expression, <lb/>
            indicates those who sew together and join pleasures to plea­ <lb/>
            sures by every means and contrivance imaginable. Therefore <lb/>
            they bind them around the place where the parts of generation <lb/>
            are seated, as that is the instrument of important transactions.</p>
          <p>And they do this, secondly, because although the fruit of <lb/>
            the fig-tree is, as I have already said, sweeter than any <lb/>
            other, yet its leaves are harder. And, therefore, Moses here <lb/>
            wishes by this symbol to intimate that the motions of plea­ <lb/>
            sure are slippery and smooth in appearance, but that they, <lb/>
            nevertheless, are in reality hard, so that it is impossible that <lb/>
            he who feels them should be delighted, unless he was pre­ <lb/>
            viously sorrowful, and he will again become sorrowful. For <lb/>
            to be always sorrowing is a melancholy thing between a <lb/>
            double grief, the one being at its beginning, and the other <lb/>
            coming before the first is ended.</p>
          <p>What is meant by the statement that the sound was <lb/>
            heard of God walking in the Paradise ? was it the sound <lb/>
            of his voice, or of his feet ? and can God be said to walk ?t</p>
          <p>42. Those gods who are in heaven, perceptible to our <lb/>
            outward senses, walk in a ring, proceeding onwards by a <lb/>
            circuitous track; but the Supreme Cause is steadfast and <lb/>
            immoveable, as the ancients have decided. But the true <lb/>
            God gives some indication also, as if he wished to give a <lb/>
            sense of motion. For in truth even without his uttering <lb/>
            any words, the prophets hear him, by a certain virtue of <lb/>
            some diviner voice sounding in their ears, or perhaps being <lb/>
            even articulately uttered.</p>
          <p>As therefore God is heard without uttering any sound, <lb/>
            so also he gives an idea of walking when he is not walking, <lb/>
            nay, though he is altogether immoveable. But do you not <lb/>
            see that before they had tasted of wickedness, as they were <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 8. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note> <note type="footnote"> TOL. IT. </note> <note type="footnote"> X </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            stable and constant, and immoveable and tranquil, and <lb/>
            uniform, so also in an equal manner must they have looked <lb/>
            upon the Deity as immoveable, as in fact he is. But they <lb/>
            once had become endued with cunning, they, by judging from <lb/>
            themselves, began to strip him of his attributes of immo­ <lb/>
            bility and unchangeableness, and conjectured that he too <lb/>
            was subject to variation and change.</p>
          <p>Why while they are hiding themselves from the face o <lb/>
            God, the woman is not mentioned first, since she was the <lb/>
            first to eat of the forbidden fruit: but why the man is <lb/>
            spoken of in the first place; for the sacred historian's <lb/>
            words are, " And Adam and his wife hid themselves ?"*</p>
          <p>43. The woman, being imperfect and depraved by nature, <lb/>
            made the beginning of sinning and prevaricating; but the <lb/>
            man, as being the more excellent and perfect creature, was <lb/>
            the first to set the example of blushing and of being <lb/>
            ashamed, and indeed, of every good feeling and action.</p>
          <p>Why they did not hide themselves in some other place, <lb/>
            but in the middle of the trees of the Paradise ?f</p>
          <p>44. Every thing is not done by sinners with wisdom and <lb/>
            sagacity, but it often happens that while thieves are watch­ <lb/>
            ing for an opportunity of plunder, having no thoughts of <lb/>
            the Deity who presides over the world, the booty which is <lb/>
            close to them and lying at their feet is by some admirable <lb/>
            management wrested from them without delay : and some­ <lb/>
            thing of this kind took place on the present occasion. For <lb/>
            when they ought rather to have fled to a distance from the <lb/>
            garden in which their offence had taken place, they still were <lb/>
            arrested in the middle of the Paradise itself, in order that <lb/>
            they might be convicted of their sin too clearly to find any <lb/>
            refuge even in flight itself. And this statement indicates <lb/>
            in a figurative manner that every wicked man takes refuge <lb/>
            in wickedness, and that every man who is wholly devoted to <lb/>
            his passions flies to those passions as to an asylum.</p>
          <p>Why God asks Adam, "Where art thou?" when he <lb/>
            knows everything: and why he does not also put the same <lb/>
            question to the woman ?J</p>
          <p>45. The expression, "Where art thou ?" does not here <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 9. </note><note type="footnote">1 Ibid. </note><note type="footnote">J Genesis iii. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="307"/>
            seem to be a mere interrogatory, but rather a threat and a <lb/>
            conviction : " Where art thou now, 0 man ? from how many <lb/>
            good things art thou changed ? having forsaken immortality <lb/>
            and a life of the most perfect happiness, you have become <lb/>
            changed to death and misery in which you are buried."</p>
          <p>But God did not condescend to put any question to the <lb/>
            woman at all, looking upon her as the cause of the evil <lb/>
            which had occurred, and as the guide to her husband to a <lb/>
            life of shame.</p>
          <p>But there is an allegorical meaning in this passage, <lb/>
            because the principal part is the man, his guide, the mind, <lb/>
            having in itself the masculine principle, when it gives ear to <lb/>
            any one introduces also the defect of the female part, <lb/>
            namely that of the outward sense.</p>
          <p>Wby the man says, " The woman gave me of the tree, and <lb/>
            I did eat;"* but the'woman does not say, " The serpent <lb/>
            gave to me, but, " The serpent beguiled me and I did eat ?</p>
          <p>46. The literal expression here affords grounds for that <lb/>
            probable opinion that woman is accustomed rather to be <lb/>
            deceived than to devise anything of importance out of her <lb/>
            own head ; but with the man the case is just the contrary. <lb/>
            But as regards the intellect, everything which is the object <lb/>
            of the outward senses beguiles and seduces each. particular <lb/>
            sense of every imperfect being to which it is adapted. And <lb/>
            the sense then, being vitiated by the object, infects the <lb/>
            dominant and principal part, the mind, with its own taint. <lb/>
            Therefore the mind receives the impression from the outward <lb/>
            sense, giving it that which it has received itself. For the <lb/>
            outward sense is deceived and beguiled by the sensible <lb/>
            object submitted to it, but the senses of the wise man are <lb/>
            infallible, as are also the cogitations of his mind.</p>
          <p>Why God curses the serpent first, then the woman, and <lb/>
            the man last of all ?"t</p>
          <p>47. The reason is that the order of the curses followed <lb/>
            the order in which the offences were committed. The first <lb/>
            offence was the deceit practised by the serpent; the second <lb/>
            was the sin of the woman which was owing to him when <lb/>
            bhe abandoned herself to his seduction; the third thing <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 12, </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iiL 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="308"/>
            was the guilt of the man in yielding rather to the inclination <lb/>
            of the woman than to the commandment of God. But <lb/>
            this order is very admirable, containing within itself a <lb/>
            perfect allegory; inasmuch as the serpent is the emblem of <lb/>
            desire, as is proved, and the woman of the outward sense; <lb/>
            but the man is the symbol of intellect. Therefore the <lb/>
            infamous author of the sin is desire; and that first deceives <lb/>
            the outward sense, and then the outward sense captivates <lb/>
            the mind.</p>
          <p>Why the curse is pronounced on the serpent in this <lb/>
            manner, that he shall go on his breast and on his belly, and <lb/>
            eat dust, and be at enmity with the woman ? *</p>
          <p>48. The words in themselves are plain enough, and we <lb/>
            have evidence of them in what we have seen. But the real <lb/>
            meaning contains an allegory concealed beneath it; since <lb/>
            the serpent is the emblem of desire, representing under a <lb/>
            figure a man devoted to pleasure. For he creeps upon his <lb/>
            breast and upon his belly, being filled with meat and drink <lb/>
            like cormorants, being inflamed by an insatiable cupidity, <lb/>
            and being incontinent in their voracity and devouring of <lb/>
            flesh, so that whatever relates to food is in every article some­ <lb/>
            thing earthly, on which account he is said to eat the dust.</p>
          <p>But desire has naturally a quarrel with the outward sense, <lb/>
            which Moses here symbolically calls the woman ; but where <lb/>
            the passions appear to be as it were guardians and champions <lb/>
            in behalf of the senses, nevertheless they are beyond all <lb/>
            question still more clearly flatterers forming devices against <lb/>
            them like so many enemies; and it is the custom of those <lb/>
            who are contending with one another to perpetrate greater <lb/>
            evils by means of those things which they concede. Forsooth <lb/>
            they turn the eyes to the ruin of the sight, the ears to <lb/>
            hearing what is unwelcome; and the rest of the outward <lb/>
            senses to insensibility. Moreover they cause dissolution and <lb/>
            paralysis to the entire body, taking away from it all sound­ <lb/>
            ness, and foolishly building up instead a great number of <lb/>
            most mischievous diseases.</p>
          <p>Why the curse pronounced against the woman is the <lb/>
            multiplication of her sadness and groans, that she shall bring <lb/>
            forth children in sorrow, and that her desire shall be to her <lb/>
            husband, and that she shall be ruled over by him ?† <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 16. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <pb n="309"/>
            </p>
          <p>49. Every woman who is the companion for life of a hus­ <lb/>
            band suffers all those things, not indeed as a curse but as <lb/>
            necessary evils. But speaking figuratively, the human sense <lb/>
            is wholly subjected to severe labour and pain, being stricken <lb/>
            and wounded by domestic agitations. Now the following <lb/>
            are the train in the service of the outward senses : the <lb/>
            sight is the servant of the eyes, hearing of the ears, smelling <lb/>
            of the nostrils, taste of the mouth, feeling of the touch.</p>
          <p>Since the life of the worthless and wicked man is full of pain <lb/>
            and want, it arises of necessity from these facts that every <lb/>
            thing which is done in accordance with the outward sense <lb/>
            must be mingled with pain and fear. In respect of the <lb/>
            mind a conversion of the outward sense takes place towards <lb/>
            the man not as to a companion, for it, like the woman, is <lb/>
            subject to authority as being depraved, but as to a master, <lb/>
            because it has chosen violence rather than justice.</p>
          <p>Why God, as he had pronounced a curse on the serpent <lb/>
            and on the woman which bore a relation to themselves and <lb/>
            to one another, he did not pronounce a similar one upon the <lb/>
            man, but connected the earth with him, saying," Cursed is <lb/>
            the earth for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it, thorns <lb/>
            and thistles shall it bring forth unto thee, and thou shalt <lb/>
            eat the grass of the field: in the sweat of thy brow shalt <lb/>
            thou eat thy bread.?"*</p>
          <p>50. Since allintellect is a divine inspiration, God did not <lb/>
            judge it right to curse him in the manner deserved by his <lb/>
            offence; but converted his curse so as to fall upon the earth <lb/>
            and his cultivation of it. But man, as a body of co-equal <lb/>
            nature and similar character to that of the earth and under­ <lb/>
            standing, is its cultivator. When the cultivator is endowed <lb/>
            with virtue and diligence, then the body produces its <lb/>
            proper fruit, namely sanity, an excellent state of the outward <lb/>
            senses, strength, and beauty. But if the cultivator be a <lb/>
            savage, then every thing is different. For the body becomes <lb/>
            liable to a curse, since it has for its husbandman an intellect <lb/>
            unchastised and unsound. And its fruit is nothing useful, <lb/>
            but only thorns and thistles, sorrow and fear, and other vices <lb/>
            which every thought strikes down, and as it were pierces the <lb/>
            intellect with its darts. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 17. </note> <pb n="310"/>
            </p>
          <p>Bat grass here is symbolically used for food; since man <lb/>
            has changed himself from a rational animal into a brute <lb/>
            beast, having neglected all divine food, which is given by <lb/>
            philosophy, by means of distinct words and laws to regulate <lb/>
            the will.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Until thou re­ <lb/>
            turnest to the earth from which thou wast taken;” for man <lb/>
            was not created out of the earth alone, but also of the divine <lb/>
            Spirit ?*</p>
          <p>51. In the first place it is clear, that the first man who <lb/>
            was formed out of the earth was made up both of earth and <lb/>
            heaven; but because he did not continue uncorrupt, but <lb/>
            despised the commandment of God, fleeing from the most <lb/>
            excellent part, namely, from heaven, he gave himself up <lb/>
            wholly as a slave to the earth, the denser and heavier <lb/>
            element.</p>
          <p>In the second place, if any one burns with a desire of <lb/>
            virtue, which makes the soul immortal, he, beyond all ques­ <lb/>
            tion, attains to a heavenly inheritance; but because he was <lb/>
            covetous of pleasure, by which spiritual death is engendered, <lb/>
            he again gives himself over a second time to the earth, on <lb/>
            which account it is said to him, ‟ Dust thou art, and unto <lb/>
            dust shalt thou return;” therefore the earth, as it is the <lb/>
            beginning of a wicked and depraved man, so also it is his <lb/>
            end; but heaven is the beginning and end of him who is <lb/>
            endowed with virtue.</p>
          <p>Why Adam called his wife Life, and affirmed to her, <lb/>
            " Thou art the mother of all living ?"t</p>
          <p>52. In the first place, Adam gave to the first created <lb/>
            woman that familiar name of Life, inasmuch as she was des­ <lb/>
            tined to be the fountain of all the generations which should <lb/>
            ever arise upon the earth after their time.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he called her by this name because <lb/>
            she did not derive the existence of her substance out of the <lb/>
            earth, but out of a living creature, namely, out of one part <lb/>
            of the man, that is to say, out of his rib, which was formed <lb/>
            into a woman, and on that account she was called " life," <lb/>
            because she was first made out of a living creature, and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 18. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis iii 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            because the first beings who were endowed with reason were <lb/>
            to be generated from her. Nevertheless, it is possible that <lb/>
            this may have been a metaphorical expression ; for is not the <lb/>
            outward sense, which is a figurative emblem of the woman, <lb/>
            called with peculiar propriety " life ?” because it is by the <lb/>
            possession of these senses that the living being is above all <lb/>
            other means distinguished from that which is not alive, as it <lb/>
            is by that that the imaginations and impulses of the soul <lb/>
            are set in motion, for the senses are the causes of each; and, <lb/>
            in real truth the outward sense is the mother of all living <lb/>
            creatures, for as there could be no generation without a <lb/>
            mother, so also there could be no living creature without <lb/>
            sense.</p>
          <p>Why God made garments of skins for Adam and his wife, <lb/>
            and clothed them ?*</p>
          <p>53. Perhaps some one may laugh at the expressions here <lb/>
            used, considering the small value of the garments thus <lb/>
            made, as if they were not at all worthy of the labour of a <lb/>
            Creator of such dignity and greatness; but a man who has <lb/>
            a proper appreciation of wisdom and virtue will rightly and <lb/>
            deservedly look upon this work as one very suitable for a <lb/>
            God, that, namely, of teaching wisdom to those who were <lb/>
            before labouring to no purpose; and who, having but little <lb/>
            anxiety about procuring useful things, being seized with an <lb/>
            insane desire for miserable honours, have given themselves <lb/>
            up as slaves to convenience, looking upon the study of wis­ <lb/>
            dom and virtue with detestation, and being in love with <lb/>
            splendour of life and skill in mean and handicraft arts, <lb/>
            which is in no way connected with a virtuous man.</p>
          <p>And these unhappy men do not know that a frugality, <lb/>
            which is in need of nothing, becomes, as it were, a relation and <lb/>
            neighbour to man, but that luxurious splendour is banished <lb/>
            to a distance as an enemy; therefore the garment made of <lb/>
            skins, if one should come to a correct judgment, deserves to <lb/>
            be looked upon as a more noble possession than a purple <lb/>
            robe embroidered with various colours.</p>
          <p>Therefore this is the literal meaning of the text; but if <lb/>
            we look to the real meaning, then the garment of skins is a <lb/>
            figurative expression for the natural skin, that.is to say, our <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            body; for God, when first of all he made the intellect, called <lb/>
            it Adam; after that he created the outward sense, to which <lb/>
            he gave the name of Life. In the third place, he of necessity <lb/>
            also made a body, calling that by a figurative expression, a <lb/>
            garment of skins; for it was fitting that the intellect and <lb/>
            the outward sense should be clothed in a body as in a gar­ <lb/>
            ment of skins; that the creature itself might first of all <lb/>
            appear worthy of divine virtue; since by what power can <lb/>
            the formation of the human body be put together more ex­ <lb/>
            cellently, and in a more becoming manner, than by God <lb/>
            on which account he did put it together, and at the same <lb/>
            time he clothed it; when some prepare articles of human <lb/>
            clothing and others put them on; but this natural clothing, <lb/>
            contemporary with the man himself, namely, the body, be­ <lb/>
            longed to the same Being both to make and to clothe the <lb/>
            man in after it was made.</p>
          <p>Who those beings are to whom God says, " Behold, Adam <lb/>
            has become as one of us, to know good and evil ?”*</p>
          <p>54. The expression, " one of us," indicates a plurality of <lb/>
            beings; unless indeed we are to suppose, that God is con­ <lb/>
            versing with his own virtues, which he employed as instru­ <lb/>
            ments, as it were, to create the universe and all that is in <lb/>
            it; but that expression " as," resembles an enigma, and a <lb/>
            similitude, and a comparison, but is not declaratory of any <lb/>
            dissimilarity; for that which is intelligible and sensibly <lb/>
            good, and likewise that which is of a contrary character, is <lb/>
            known to God in a different manner from that in which it is <lb/>
            known to man; since, in the same way in which the natures <lb/>
            of those who inquire and those who comprehend, and the <lb/>
            things themselves too which are inquired into, and per­ <lb/>
            ceived, and comprehended, are distinguished, virtue itself is <lb/>
            also capable of comprehending them. But all these things <lb/>
            are similitudes, and forms, and images, among men; but <lb/>
            among the gods they are prototypes, models, indications, <lb/>
            and more manifest examples of things which are somewhat <lb/>
            obscure; but the unborn and uncreated Father joins himself <lb/>
            to no one, except with the intention of extending the honour <lb/>
            of his virtues.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, " Lest perchance he <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            put forth his hand and take of the tree of life, and eat and <lb/>
            live for ever;"* for there is no uncertainty and no envy <lb/>
            in God ?</p>
          <p>55. It is quite true that God never feels either uncer­ <lb/>
            tainty or envy; nevertheless he often employs ambiguous <lb/>
            things and expressions, assenting to them as a man might <lb/>
            do; for, as I have said before, the supreme providence is of <lb/>
            a twofold nature, sometimes being God, and not acting in <lb/>
            any respect as a man; but, on some occasions, as a man <lb/>
            instructs his son, so likewise should the Lord God give <lb/>
            warning to you.</p>
          <p>Therefore the first of these circumstances belongs to his <lb/>
            sovereign power, and the second to his disciplinary, and to <lb/>
            the first introduction to instruction, so as to insinuate into <lb/>
            man's heart a voluntary inclination, since that expression, <lb/>
            " lest perchance," is not to be taken as a proof of any hesi­ <lb/>
            tation on the part of God, but in relation to man, who, by <lb/>
            his nature, is prone to hesitation, and is a denunciation of <lb/>
            the inclinations which exist in him.</p>
          <p>For when any appearance of anything whatever occurs to <lb/>
            any man, immediately there arises within him an impulse <lb/>
            towards that which appears, being caused by that very thing <lb/>
            which appears. And from this arises the second hesitating <lb/>
            kind of uncertainty, distracting the mind in various direc­ <lb/>
            tions, as to whether the thing is fit to be accepted, or <lb/>
            acquired, or not. And very likely present circumstances <lb/>
            have a respect to that second feeling; for, in truth, the <lb/>
            Divinity is incapable of any cunning, or malevolence, or <lb/>
            wickedness: it is absolutely impossible that God should <lb/>
            either envy the immortality or any other good fortune be­ <lb/>
            longing to any being. And we can bring the most unde­ <lb/>
            niable proof of this; for it was not in consequence of any <lb/>
            one's entreaties that he created the world; but, being a <lb/>
            merciful benefactor, rendering an essence previously un­ <lb/>
            tamed and unregulated, and liable to suffering, gentle and <lb/>
            pleasant, he did so by a vast harmony of blessings, and a <lb/>
            regulated arrangement of them, like a chorus; and he being <lb/>
            himself the only sure being, planted the tree of life by his <lb/>
            own luminous character. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 23. </note> <pb n="314"/>
            </p>
          <p>Moreover, he was not influenced by the mediation or <lb/>
            exhortation of any other being in communicating incor­ <lb/>
            ruptibility to man. But while man existed as the purest <lb/>
            intellect, displaying no appearance either of work or of any <lb/>
            evil discourse, he was certain to have a fitting guide, to lead <lb/>
            him in the paths of piety, which is undoubted and genuine <lb/>
            immortality. But from the time when he began to be <lb/>
            converted to depravity, wishing for the things which belong <lb/>
            to mortal life, he wandered from immortality; for it is not <lb/>
            fitting that craft and wickedness should be rendered im­ <lb/>
            mortal, and moreover it would be useless to the subject; <lb/>
            since the longer the life is which is granted to the wicked <lb/>
            and depraved man, the more miserable is he than others, so <lb/>
            that his immortality becomes a grave misfortune to him.</p>
          <p>Why now he calls the Paradise "pleasure," when he is <lb/>
            sending man forth out of it to till the ground from which <lb/>
            ne was taken.*</p>
          <p>56. The distinction of agriculture is conspicuous, when <lb/>
            man in the state of paradise, practising the cultivation of <lb/>
            wisdom as if he were employed in the cultivation of trees, <lb/>
            and enjoying the food of imperishable and most useful <lb/>
            fruits, was himself endowed with immortality likewise. <lb/>
            After that, being expelled from the place of wisdom, he <lb/>
            experienced the opposite effects of ignorance, by which the <lb/>
            body is polluted, and at the same time the intellect is <lb/>
            blinded, and, being exposed to a want of proper food, he <lb/>
            wastes away, and yields to a miserable death.</p>
          <p>On which account, now, in contempt of the foolish man, <lb/>
            God calls the Paradise "pleasure," in order to put it in <lb/>
            opposition to a life of pain, and misery, and savageness. In <lb/>
            truth, the life which is passed in wisdom is a pleasure, full <lb/>
            of liberal joy, and is the constant enjoyment of a rational <lb/>
            soul; but that life which is destitute of wisdom is found to <lb/>
            be both savage and miserable, although it is excessively <lb/>
            deceived by the appetites, which pain both precedes and <lb/>
            follows.</p>
          <p>Why God places a cherubim in front of the Paradise, and <lb/>
            a flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way <lb/>
            of the tree of life ?f <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 23 </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iii. 24. </note> <pb n="315"/>
            </p>
          <p>57. The name cherubim designates the two original vir­ <lb/>
            tues which belong to the Deity, namely, his creative and <lb/>
            his royal virtues. The one of which has the title of God, <lb/>
            the other, or the royal virtue, that of Lord. Now the form <lb/>
            of the creative power is a peaceable, and gentle, and benefi­ <lb/>
            cent virtue; but the royal power is a legislative, and <lb/>
            chastising, and correcting virtue. Moreover, by the <lb/>
            flaming sword he here symbolically intimates the heaven: <lb/>
            for the air is of a flaming colour, and turns itself round, <lb/>
            revolving about the universe.</p>
          <p>Therefore, all these things assumed to themselves the <lb/>
            guardianship of the Paradise, because they are the presi­ <lb/>
            dents over wisdom, like a mirror; since, to illustrate my <lb/>
            meaning by an example, the wisdom of the world is a sort of <lb/>
            mirror of the divine virtues, in the similitude of which it <lb/>
            was perfected, and by which the universe and all the things <lb/>
            in it are regulated and arranged. But the way to wisdom is <lb/>
            called philosophy (a word which means the love or the <lb/>
            pursuit of philosophy). And since the creative virtue is <lb/>
            endued with philosophy, being both philosophical and royal, <lb/>
            so also the world itself is philosophical.</p>
          <p>Some persons however have fancied that it is the sun <lb/>
            which is indicated by the flaming sword; because, by its <lb/>
            constant revolutions and turnings every way, it marks out <lb/>
            the seasons of the year, as being the guardian of human life <lb/>
            and of every thing which serves to the life of all men.</p>
          <p>Whether it was properly said with respect to Cain: " I <lb/>
            have gotten a man from the Lord ?” *</p>
          <p>58. Here there is a distinction made, as to-from some one, <lb/>
            and out of some one, and by some thing. Out of some one, <lb/>
            as out of materials; from some one, as from a cause; and by <lb/>
            some thing, as by an instrument. But the Father and <lb/>
            Creator of all the world is not an instrument, but a cause. <lb/>
            Therefore he wanders from right wisdom who says, " That <lb/>
            what has been made has been made, not from God, but by <lb/>
            God."</p>
          <p>Why the sacred historian first describes the employment <lb/>
            of the younger brother, Abel, saying: " He was a keeper of <lb/>
            sheep ; but Cain was a cultivator of the earth ? " t <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 1. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iv. 2. </note> <pb n="316"/>
            </p>
          <p>59. Since, although the virtuous son was in point of time <lb/>
            younger than the wicked son, yet in point of virtue he was <lb/>
            older. On which account, on the present occasion, when <lb/>
            their actions are to be compared together, he is placed first. <lb/>
            Therefore one of them exercises a business, and takes care <lb/>
            of living creatures, although they are devoid of reason, gladly <lb/>
            taking upon himself the employment of a shepherd, which <lb/>
            is a princely office, and as it were a sort of rehearsal of royal <lb/>
            power; but the other devotes his attention to earthly and <lb/>
            inanimate objects.</p>
          <p>Why Cain after some days offers up the first-fruits of his <lb/>
            fruits, but when it is said that "Abel offered up first-fruits of <lb/>
            the first-born of his flock and of the fat," * "after some days" <lb/>
            is not added ?</p>
          <p>60. Moses here intimates the difference between a lover <lb/>
            of himself, and one who is thoroughly devoted to God; for <lb/>
            the one took to himself the first-fruits of his fruits, and very <lb/>
            impiously looked upon God as worthy only of the secondary <lb/>
            and inferior offerings; for the expression, "after some days," <lb/>
            implies that he did not do so immediately; and when it is <lb/>
            said that he offered of the fruits, that intimates that he did <lb/>
            not offer of the best fruits which he had, and herein displays <lb/>
            his iniquity.</p>
          <p>But the other, without any delay, offered up the first-born <lb/>
            and eldest of all his flocks, in order that in this the Father <lb/>
            might not be treated unworthily.</p>
          <p>Why, when he had begun with Cain, he still mentions <lb/>
            him here in the second place, when he says: " And God <lb/>
            had respect unto Abel and unto his offerings; but unto <lb/>
            Cain and unto his sacrifices he paid no attention ?”†</p>
          <p>61. In the first place, because the good man, who is by <lb/>
            nature first, is not at first perceived by the outward senses <lb/>
            of any man except in his own turn, and by people of virtuous <lb/>
            conduct. Secondly, because the good and the wicked man <lb/>
            are two distinct characters; he accepts the good man, seeing <lb/>
            that- he is a lover of what is good, and an eager student of <lb/>
            virtue ; but he rejects and regards with aversion the wicked <lb/>
            man, presuming that he will be prone to that side by the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 3. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            order of nature. Therefore he says here with exceeding <lb/>
            fitness, that God had regard, not to the offerings, but to <lb/>
            those who offered them, rather than to the gifts themselves; <lb/>
            for men have regard to and regulate their approbation by <lb/>
            the abundance and richness of offerings, but God looks at <lb/>
            the sincerity of the soul, having no regard to ambition or <lb/>
            illusion of any kind.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the distinction here made be­ <lb/>
            tween a gift and a sacrifice ?*</p>
          <p>62. The man who slays a sacrifice, after having made a <lb/>
            division, pours the blood around the altar and takes the flesh <lb/>
            home; but he who offers it as a gift, offers as it should seem <lb/>
            the whole to him who accepts it. Therefore, the man who <lb/>
            is a lover of self is a distributor, like Cain; but he who is a <lb/>
            lover of God is the giver of a free gift, as was Abel.</p>
          <p>How it was that Cain became aware that his offering had <lb/>
            not pleased God?†</p>
          <p>63. Perhaps he resolved his doubts, an additional cause <lb/>
            being added, for sorrow seized upon him and his counte­ <lb/>
            nance fell. Therefore, he took the sorrow which he felt as <lb/>
            an indication that be had been sacrificing what was not <lb/>
            pleasing or approved of, when joy and happiness would have <lb/>
            been suited to one who was sacrificing with purity of heart <lb/>
            and spirit.</p>
          <p>Why is it that the expression used is not, because you do <lb/>
            not offer rightly; but, because (or unless) you do not divide <lb/>
            rightly ? ‡</p>
          <p>64. In the first place, we must understand that right <lb/>
            division and improper division are nothing else but order <lb/>
            and the want of it. And it is by order that the universal <lb/>
            world and its parts were made; since the Creator of the <lb/>
            world, when he began to arrange and regulate the pre­ <lb/>
            viously untamed and unarranged power which was liable to <lb/>
            suffering, employed section and division. For he placed the <lb/>
            heavy elements which were prone to descend downwards by <lb/>
            their own nature, namely, the earth and the water, in the <lb/>
            centre of the universe; but he placed the air and the fire at <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 4. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis iv. 5. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis iv. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            a greater altitude, as they were raised on high by reason of <lb/>
            their lightness.</p>
          <p>But separating and dividing the pure nature, namely <lb/>
            heaven, he carried it round and diffused it over the universe, <lb/>
            so that it should be completely invisible to all men; con­ <lb/>
            taining within itself the whole universe in all its parts.</p>
          <p>Again, the statement that animals and plants are pro­ <lb/>
            duced out of seeds, some moist and some dry, what else <lb/>
            does it mean but the inevitable dissection and separation of <lb/>
            distinction ? Therefore it follows inevitably, that this order <lb/>
            and arrangement of the universe must be imitated in all <lb/>
            things, especially in feeling and acknowledging gratitude; <lb/>
            by which we are invited to requite in some degree and <lb/>
            manner the kindnesses of those who have showered greater <lb/>
            benefits liberally on us. Moreover, to pay one's thanks to <lb/>
            God is an action which is intrinsically right in itself: and <lb/>
            it is not to be disapproved of that he should receive the <lb/>
            offerings due to him at the earliest moment, and fresh gifts <lb/>
            from the first-fruits of every thing, not being dishonoured by <lb/>
            any negligence on our part. Since it is not fitting that man <lb/>
            should reserve for himself the first and most excellent things <lb/>
            which are created, and should offer what is only second best <lb/>
            to the all-wise God and Creator; for that division would be <lb/>
            faulty and blameworthy, showing a most preposterous and <lb/>
            unnatural arrangement.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression: "You have done <lb/>
            wrongly; now rest ? " *</p>
          <p>65. He is here giving very useful advice; since, to do no <lb/>
            wrong at all is the greatest of all good things: but he who <lb/>
            sins, and who thus blushes and is overwhelmed with shame, <lb/>
            is near akin to him, being, if I may use such a phrase, as the <lb/>
            younger brother to the elder; for those persons who pride <lb/>
            themselves on their errors as if they had not done wrong, are <lb/>
            afflicted with a disease which is difficult to cure, or rather <lb/>
            which is altogether incurable.</p>
          <p>Why he seems to be giving what is good into the hand of <lb/>
            a wicked man, when he says, " And unto thee shall be his <lb/>
            desire ?" t <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 8. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note> <pb n="319"/>
            </p>
          <p>66. He does not deliver good into his hand; but the <lb/>
            expression is heard with different feelings; since he is <lb/>
            speaking, not of a pious man, but after the action is accom­ <lb/>
            plished, saying of him: The desire and respect of the <lb/>
            impiety of this man's wickedness will be towards you. Do <lb/>
            not therefore talk about necessity, but about your own <lb/>
            habits, in order that thus he may represent the voluntary <lb/>
            action.</p>
          <p>And again, the sentence, " And you shall be his ruler <lb/>
            over him," has a reference to the operation. In the first, <lb/>
            place, you begin to act with wickedness; and now behold, <lb/>
            another iniquity follows that great and injurious iniquity. <lb/>
            Therefore, he both thinks and affirms that this is the <lb/>
            principal part of all voluntary injury.</p>
          <p>Why he slew his brother in the field ?*</p>
          <p>67. That as all infecundity and sterility arises from a <lb/>
            neglect of sowing and planting land a second time, he may <lb/>
            be kept continually in mind of his wicked murder, and self­ <lb/>
            blamed for it; since the ground was not to be the same for <lb/>
            the future, after it was compelled, contrary to its nature, to <lb/>
            drink of human blood, to bring forth food to that man who <lb/>
            imbued it with the polluted stain of blood.</p>
          <p>Why he who knows all things asks the fratricide: " Where <lb/>
            is tby brother Abel ?”†</p>
          <p>68. He puts this question to him because he wishes the <lb/>
            man to confess voluntarily and spontaneously, of his own <lb/>
            accord, so that he may not imagine that every thing is done <lb/>
            out of necessity; for he who had slain another through <lb/>
            necessity, would have confessed unwillingly, as having done <lb/>
            the deed unwillingly; since that which does not depend <lb/>
            upon ourselves does not deserve accusation; but the man <lb/>
            who has done wrong intentionally denies it; for those who <lb/>
            do wrong are liable to repentance. Therefore, he has inter­ <lb/>
            woven this principle in all parts of his legislation, because <lb/>
            the Deity himself is never the cause of evil.</p>
          <p>Why he who had slain his brother makes answer as if he <lb/>
            were replying to a man; and says, " I do not know: am I <lb/>
            my brother's keeper ?”‡ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 9. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis iv. 10. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis iv. 9. </note> <pb n="320"/>
            </p>
          <p>69. It is the opinion of an atheist to think that the eye of <lb/>
            God does not penetrate through every thing, and behold all <lb/>
            things at the same time; piercing not only through what is <lb/>
            visible, but also through every thing which lurks in the <lb/>
            deepest and bottomless unfathomable abysses.</p>
          <p>Suppose a person, said to him, " How can you be ignorant <lb/>
            where your brother is, and how is it that you do not know <lb/>
            that, when as yet he is one out of the only four human beings <lb/>
            which exist in the world? He being one with both his parents, <lb/>
            and you his only brother." To this question the reply made <lb/>
            is: "I am not my brother's keeper." 0 what a beautiful <lb/>
            apology! And whose keeper and protector ought you to have <lb/>
            been, rather than your brother's ? But if you have excited <lb/>
            your diligence to give effect to violence, and injury, and fraud, <lb/>
            and homicide, which are the foulest and most abominable of <lb/>
            actions, why did you consider the safety of your brother a <lb/>
            secondary object ? ”</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expresssion, " The voice of thy <lb/>
            brother's blood cries to me out of the earth ? " *</p>
          <p>70. This is especially an example by which to take warning; <lb/>
            for the Deity listens to those who are worthy, although they <lb/>
            be dead, knowing that they are alive as to an incorporeal life. <lb/>
            But he averts his countenance from the prayers of the <lb/>
            wicked, although they are living a flourishing life, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he looks upon them as dead to any real life, carrying <lb/>
            about their bodies like a sepulchre; and having buried their <lb/>
            miserable souls in it.</p>
          <p>Why he is said to be cursed upon the earth ? t</p>
          <p>71. The earth is the last portion of the world, therefore if <lb/>
            that utters curses, we must consider that the other elements <lb/>
            do likewise pour forth adequate maledictions ; for instance, <lb/>
            the fountains, and rivers, and sea, and the air, and the land, <lb/>
            and the fire, and the light, and the sun, and moon, and stars, <lb/>
            and in short the whole heaven. For if inanimate and <lb/>
            earthly nature, throwing off the yoke, wars against injury, <lb/>
            why may not still rather those natures do so which are of a <lb/>
            purer character? But as for him, against whom the parts <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 10. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis iv. 11</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            of the world carry on war, what hope of safety he can have <lb/>
            for the future, I know not.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the curse, "You shall be groaning <lb/>
            and trembling upon the earth?" *</p>
          <p>72. This also is a general principle ; for in all evils there <lb/>
            are some things which are perceived immediately, and some <lb/>
            which are felt at a later period; for those which are future <lb/>
            cause fear, and those which are felt at once bring sorrow.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of Cain saying, " My punishment is <lb/>
            too great for you to dismiss me ? +</p>
          <p>73. In truth there is no misery greater than to be deserted <lb/>
            and despised by God; for the anarchy of fools is cruel and <lb/>
            very intolerable ; but to be despised by the great King, and <lb/>
            to fall down as an abject person cast down from the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of the- Supreme Power is an indescribable affliction.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of Cain, when he says, " Everyone <lb/>
            who shall find me will kill me:" when there was scarcely <lb/>
            another human being in the world except his parents ?‡</p>
          <p>74. In the first place he might have received injury from <lb/>
            the parts of the world which indeed were made for the <lb/>
            advantage of the good and that they might partake of them, <lb/>
            but which nevertheless, derived from the wicked no slight <lb/>
            degree of revenge. In the second place it may be that he <lb/>
            said this, because he was apprehensive of injury from beasts, <lb/>
            and reptiles; for nature has brought forth these animals with <lb/>
            the express object of their being instruments of vengeance <lb/>
            on the wicked.</p>
          <p>In the third place, some people may imagine that he is <lb/>
            speaking with reference to his parents, on whom he had <lb/>
            inflicted an unprecedented sorrow, and the first evil which <lb/>
            had happened to them, before they knew what death was.</p>
          <p>Why whoever should slay Cain should be liable to bear a <lb/>
            sevenfold punishment ?§</p>
          <p>75. As our soul consists of eight portions, being accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to be divided in its rational and irrational individuality <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 13. Our translation is, ‟My punishment is greater <lb/>
            than I can bear." </note><note type="footnote"> + Genesis iv. 12. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis iv. 14. </note><note type="footnote">§ Genesis iv. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            into seven subordinate parts, namely into the five outward <lb/>
            senses, and the instrument of vice, and the faculty of gene­ <lb/>
            ration ; those seven parts exist among the causes of wicked­ <lb/>
            ness and evil, on which account they likewise fall under <lb/>
            judgment; but the death of the principal and dominant <lb/>
            portion of man, namely of the mind, is principally the <lb/>
            wickedness which exists in it. Whoever therefore slays the <lb/>
            mind, mingling in it folly, and insensibility, instead of sense, <lb/>
            will cause dissolution also of the seven irrational parts; since, <lb/>
            just as the principal and leading part had a portion from <lb/>
            virtue, in the same manner likewise are its subject divisions <lb/>
            composed.</p>
          <p>Why a sign is put on him who had slain his brother, that <lb/>
            no one should kill him who found him : when it would have <lb/>
            been natural to do the contrary, namely, to give him over to <lb/>
            the hands of an executioner to be put to death ?*</p>
          <p>76. This is said because, in the first place, the change of <lb/>
            the nature of living is one kind of death; but continual <lb/>
            sorrow and unmixed fear are destitute of joy and devoid of all <lb/>
            good hope, and so they bring on many terrible and various <lb/>
            evils which are so many sensible deaths.</p>
          <p>In the second place, the sacred historian designs at the <lb/>
            very beginning of his work to enunciate the law about the <lb/>
            incorruptibility of the soul, and to confute as deceitful those <lb/>
            who look upon the life which is contained in this body as the <lb/>
            only happy life ; for behold one of the two brothers is guilty <lb/>
            of those enormous crimes which have already been men­ <lb/>
            tioned, namely, impiety and fratricide ; and he is still alive, <lb/>
            and begetting offspring, and building cities. But the other <lb/>
            who was praised in respect of his piety is treacherously put <lb/>
            to death; while the voice of the Lord not only clearly cries <lb/>
            out that that existence which is perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses is not good, and that such a death is not evil, but <lb/>
            also that that life which is in the flesh is not life, but that <lb/>
            there is another given to man free from old age, and more <lb/>
            immortal, which the incorporeal souls have received; for that <lb/>
            expression of the poet about Scylla, <lb/>
            "That is not mortal but an endless woe,” + <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> t The line occurs, Homer, Odyss. xii. 118: ἡ δέ τοι οὐ θνήτα ἀλλ' ἀθάνατον κακὀν ἐστιν. </note>  <lb/>
               <pb n="323"/>
              is asserted in the same familiarity about a person who lives <lb/>
              ill and passes a long life for many years in the practice of <lb/>
              wickedness.</p>
          <p>In the third place, since Cain had perpetrated this fra­ <lb/>
            tricide of enormous guilt above all other crimes, he* presents <lb/>
            himself to him, quite forgetful of the injury that he has done, <lb/>
            imposing on all judges a most peaceful law for the first crime; <lb/>
            not that they are not to destroy malefactors, but that resting <lb/>
            for a while with great patience and long suffering, they shall <lb/>
            study compassion rather than severity.</p>
          <p>But God himself, with the most perfect wisdom, has laid <lb/>
            down the rule of familiarity and intelligence with reference <lb/>
            to the first sinner : not slaying the homicide, but destroying <lb/>
            him in another manner; since he scarcely permitted him to <lb/>
            be enumerated among the generations of his father, but shows <lb/>
            him proscribed not only by his parents but by the whole <lb/>
            race of mankind, allotting him a state separate from that of <lb/>
            others, and secluded from the class of rational animals, as <lb/>
            one who had been expelled, and banished, and turned into <lb/>
            the nature of beasts.</p>
          <p>Why Lamech, after the fifth generation, blames himself <lb/>
            for the fratricide of his elder Cain ; saying, as the scripture <lb/>
            reports, to his wives, Adah and Zillah ; " I have slain a man <lb/>
            to my injury and a young man to my hurt; since if vengeance <lb/>
            is taken upon Cain sevenfold, it shall certainly be taken on <lb/>
            Lamcch seventy and sevenfold ? " *</p>
          <p>77. In numerals one is before ten, both in order and in <lb/>
            virtue, for it is the first beginning and element and measure <lb/>
            of all things. But the number ten is subsequent, and is <lb/>
            measured by the other, being inferior to it, both in order <lb/>
            and virtue ; therefore, also, the number seven is antecedent <lb/>
            in its origin to and more ancient than the number seventy, <lb/>
            but the number seventy is younger than the number seven, <lb/>
            and contains the calculation of generations.</p>
          <p>These premises being laid down, he who first committed <lb/>
            sin, as if he had been really always ignorant of evil, like <lb/>
            the first odd number, namely, the unit, is chastised more <lb/>
            simply ; but the second offender, because he had the first <lb/>
            for an example, so that there cannot possibly be any excuse <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            made for him, is guilty of a voluntary crime, and because <lb/>
            he did not receive honourable wisdom from that more sim­ <lb/>
            ple punishment, the consequence will be that he will both <lb/>
            suffer all that first punishment, and will, moreover, receive <lb/>
            this second one, which is contained in the number ten.</p>
          <p>For as in the horse-races they pay the groom who has <lb/>
            trained the horse twice as great a reward as they give to the <lb/>
            driver, so some wicked men, inclined to acts of injustice, <lb/>
            gain the miserable triumph of victory and then are punished <lb/>
            with a double punishment, both by the first one which is <lb/>
            contained in the unit, and also by the second which is <lb/>
            contained in the number ten; besides, Cain being the <lb/>
            author of a homicide, when he was ignorant of the great­ <lb/>
            ness of the pollution which he was incurring, because no <lb/>
            death had hitherto taken place in the world, suffered a more <lb/>
            simple punishment, namely, only a sevenfold penalty in the <lb/>
            order of the unit; but as his imitator could not take refuge <lb/>
            in the same plea of ignorance, he ought to be subjected to <lb/>
            a twofold punishment, not only to one equal and similar to <lb/>
            that which had been inflicted on the first offender, but also <lb/>
            another, which should be the seventh among the decades. <lb/>
            In truth, according to the law, the trial which is before the <lb/>
            tribunal is a sevenfold one; first of all, the eyes are put <lb/>
            on their trial, because they beheld what was not lawful; <lb/>
            secondly, the ears are impeached, because they heard what <lb/>
            they ought not to have heard ; thirdly, the smell is brought <lb/>
            into question, as having been reduced by smoke and vapour; <lb/>
            fourthly, the taste is accused, as being subservient to the <lb/>
            pleasures of the belly ; fifthly, a charge is brought against <lb/>
            the taste, by means of which, besides the operations of the <lb/>
            senses above-mentioned, in respect of those things which <lb/>
            prevail over the spirit, other things, also, are superadded <lb/>
            separately, such as the takings of cities, the captivities of <lb/>
            men. the destructions of those citadels of cities in which <lb/>
            wisdom dwells ; sixthly, an accusation is urged against the <lb/>
            tongue and other instruments of speech, for being silent <lb/>
            as to what should be spoken of, and speaking of what <lb/>
            should be buried in silence ; and, in the seventh place, the <lb/>
            lower part of the belly is impeached for inflaming and <lb/>
            exciting the passions by immoderate lust.</p>
          <p>This is the meaning of that expression, according to which <lb/>
            a sevenfold vengeance was taken upon Cain, but a seventy <lb/>
             <pb n="325"/>
            and sevenfold vengeance upon Lamech for the causes above <lb/>
            mentioned, because he was the second offender, not having <lb/>
            been taught by the punishment of the first delinquent, and <lb/>
            therefore he is altogether worthy to receive his punishment, <lb/>
            which is the more simple one, like the unit in numerals, <lb/>
            and, also, a manifold punishment too equal to the number ten.</p>
          <p>Why Adam, when he begat Seth, introduces him saying, <lb/>
            ‟ God has raised up for me another seed in the place of <lb/>
            Abel whom Cain slew ? "*</p>
          <p>78. In real truth Seth is another seed and the beginning <lb/>
            of a second nativity of Abel, in accordance with a certain <lb/>
            natural principle; for Abel is like to one who comes down <lb/>
            below from above, on which account it was that he perished <lb/>
            injuriously ; but Seth resembles one who is proceeding up­ <lb/>
            wards from below, on which account he also increases. <lb/>
            And in proof of this argument Abel is explained as having <lb/>
            been brought back and offered upwards to God. But it <lb/>
            is not proper that everything should be raised and borne <lb/>
            upwards, but only that which is good, for God is in no <lb/>
            respect whatever the cause of evil.</p>
          <p>Therefore, whatever is indistinct and uncertain, and <lb/>
            mingled, and in confusion and disorder, has also, very <lb/>
            properly, blame and praise mingled together: praise, be­ <lb/>
            cause it honours the cause, and blame, since as the occurrence <lb/>
            happened fortuitously, so it is without any plans having been <lb/>
            formed or any gratitude expressed. Moreover, nature also <lb/>
            separated the two sons from him; it rendered the good one <lb/>
            worthy of immortality, resolving him into a voice inter­ <lb/>
            ceding with God; but the wicked one it gave over to <lb/>
            corruption.</p>
          <p>But the name Seth is interpreted ‟ watered," according <lb/>
            to the variation of plants which grow by being watered, <lb/>
            and put forth shoots and bear fruit. But these things are <lb/>
            the symbols of the soul, so that it is not lawful to assert <lb/>
            that the Divinity is the cause of all things equally, of the <lb/>
            bad as well as of the good, but only of the good, and that <lb/>
            alone ought to be planted alive.</p>
          <p>Why Enos, the son of Seth, hoped to call upon the name <lb/>
            of the Lord God ?t <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 25. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis iv. 26. </note> <pb n="326"/>
            </p>
          <p>79. The name Enos is interpreted ‟ man;” and it is <lb/>
            received as meaning, not the whole of the combined man, <lb/>
            but as the rational part of the soul, namely, the intellect, <lb/>
            to which it is peculiarly becoming to hope, for irrational <lb/>
            animals are devoid of hope; but hope is a sort of presage <lb/>
            of joy, and before joy there is an expectation of good <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Why, after the mention of hope, Moses says, " This is <lb/>
            the book of the generations of men ? "*</p>
          <p>SO. It is by this that he made what has been said before <lb/>
            worthy of belief. What is man ? Man is a being which, <lb/>
            beyond all other races of animals, has received a copious <lb/>
            and wonderful portion of hope; and this is as it were <lb/>
            inscribed on his very nature, and celebrated there; for the <lb/>
            human intellect hopes by its own nature.</p>
          <p>Why, in the genealogy of Adam, Moses no longer men­ <lb/>
            tions Cain, but only Seth, who, he says, was according to <lb/>
            his appearance and form; on which account he proceeds <lb/>
            to retain the generations which descend from him in his <lb/>
            genealogy ?t</p>
          <p>81. It can neither be lawful to enumerate a wicked and <lb/>
            sinful murderer either in the list of reason or in that of <lb/>
            number; for he must be cast out like dung, as some one <lb/>
            said, looking upon him as one of such a character; and on <lb/>
            this account the sacred historian neither points him out as <lb/>
            the successor of his father who had been formed out of the <lb/>
            dust, nor as the head of succeeding generations; but he <lb/>
            distributes both these characteristics to him who was with­ <lb/>
            out pollution, and names Seth, who is a drinker of water, <lb/>
            as having been watered by his father, and as begetting hope <lb/>
            in his own increase and progress; on which account it is not <lb/>
            inconsiderately and foolishly that he says that he was born <lb/>
            according to the form and appearance of his father, to the <lb/>
            reproof of his elder brother, who, on account of the foulness <lb/>
            of the murder which he had committed, has nothing in him <lb/>
            resembling his father, either in body or soul.</p>
          <p>And on this account Moses has separated him from the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 1. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis v. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            family, and has given his share to his brother, being the <lb/>
            noble privilege of the birthright of the first-born.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the verse, Enoch pleased God <lb/>
            after he begat Methuselah, two hundred years ?*</p>
          <p>82. God appointed by the law the fountains of all good <lb/>
            things to be under the principles of generation itself. And <lb/>
            what I mean is something of this sort. A little while before <lb/>
            he appointed mercy and pardon to exist, now again he de­ <lb/>
            crees that penitence shall exist, not in any degree mocking <lb/>
            or reproaching these men, who are believed to have offended, <lb/>
            and at the same time giving the soul an opportunity to mount <lb/>
            up from wickedness to virtue, like the conversion of those <lb/>
            who are proceeding towards a snare. For behold, the man <lb/>
            being made a husband and a father together with his birth, <lb/>
            makes a beginning of honesty.</p>
          <p>And he is said to please God, for although he does not <lb/>
            persevere in piety from the moment that he is born, never­ <lb/>
            theless, all that remaining period is counted to him as having <lb/>
            been spent in a praiseworthy mode of life, because he pleased <lb/>
            God for so many years. And these things are said, not be­ <lb/>
            cause it perhaps was, but it might perhaps have seemed <lb/>
            different; but he approves of the order of things, for <lb/>
            indulgence having been exemplified, in this case of Cain, <lb/>
            after no long interval of time, he introduces this statement, <lb/>
            that Enoch practised repentance, warning us by it that <lb/>
            repentance alone can procure indulgence.</p>
          <p>Why Enoch, who cultivated repentance, is said to have <lb/>
            lived before his repentance a hundred and sixty-five years, <lb/>
            but two hundred after his repentance ?†</p>
          <p>83. This number of a hundred and sixty-five is combined <lb/>
            of the singular addition of ten numbers from the unit to <lb/>
            ten; as one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, <lb/>
            ten, the total of which is fifty-five. And again, from that <lb/>
            by the addition of ten numbers, which, removing the unit <lb/>
            proceed upwards by twos, as two, four, six, eight, ten, <lb/>
            twelve, fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, which make a <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> t Ibid. This is at variance with the statement in the Bible, which <lb/>
            says he lived sixty-five years before the birth of Methuselah, and <lb/>
            walked with God three hundred years. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            hundred and ten ; the combination of which, with the num­ <lb/>
            bers first mentioned, produces a hundred and sixty-five; <lb/>
            and in this addition the even numbers amount to twice as <lb/>
            much as the odd numbers; for the woman is more violent <lb/>
            than the man, in the preposterous manner in which the <lb/>
            wicked man rules over the virtuous man, the outward sense <lb/>
            over the mind, the body over the outward sense, and matter <lb/>
            over its cause.</p>
          <p>But the number two hundred, in which repentance was <lb/>
            practised, is combined of two numbers of one hundred, the <lb/>
            first hundred of which intimates a purification from injustice, <lb/>
            but the other indicates the plenitude of perfect virtue. In <lb/>
            truth, before anything else is done, the first thing is to cut off <lb/>
            from a sick body every diseased part, and after that means of <lb/>
            cure are to be applied to it, for this is the first step, and <lb/>
            the other the second. Moreover, the number two hundred <lb/>
            consists of fours, for it is produced as from seed, from four <lb/>
            triangular numbers, and from four tetragons, and from four <lb/>
            pentagons, and from four hexagons, and from four heptagons; <lb/>
            and, as one may say, it fixes its step on the number seven. <lb/>
            Now the four triangles are these, one, three, six, ten, which <lb/>
            make twenty; the four tetragons are one, four, nine, six­ <lb/>
            teen, which make thirty; from the four pentagons, one, five, <lb/>
            twelve, twenty-two, is made the number forty. Moreover, the <lb/>
            four hexagons, one, six, fifteen, twenty-eight, make fifty; and <lb/>
            the four heptagons, one, seven, eighteen, thirty-four, make <lb/>
            sixty; and all these numbers put together make two hundred.</p>
          <p>Why the man who lives a life of repentance is said to have <lb/>
            lived three hundred and sixty-five years?*</p>
          <p>84. In the first place, the year contains three hundred and <lb/>
            sixty-five days; therefore, by the symbol of the solar orbit, the <lb/>
            sacred historian here indicates the life of the repentant man. <lb/>
            In the second place, as the sun is the cause of day and night, <lb/>
            performing his revolutions by day above the hemisphere of the <lb/>
            earth, and his course by night under the earth, so also the life <lb/>
            of the man of repentance consists of alternations of light and <lb/>
            darkness ; of darkness, that is, of times of agitation and cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances of injury; and of light, when the light of virtue <lb/>
            and its radiant brilliancy arises. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 23. </note> <pb n="329"/>
            </p>
          <p>In the third place, he has assigned to him a complete num­ <lb/>
            ber, as the sun is ordained to be the chief of the stars of <lb/>
            heaven, under an appointed number, in the time which came <lb/>
            before the period of his repentance, to lead to the oblivion of <lb/>
            the sins previously committed; since, as God is good, he be. <lb/>
            stows the greatest favours most abundantly, and, at the same <lb/>
            time, he effaces the former offences of those who devote them­ <lb/>
            selves to him, and which might deserve chastisement, by a <lb/>
            recollection of their virtues.</p>
          <p>Why, when Enoch died, the sacred historian adds the <lb/>
            assertion, " He pleased God?"*</p>
          <p>85. In the first place, he says this because, by such a <lb/>
            statement, he implies that the soul is immortal, inasmuch as <lb/>
            after it is stripped of the body, it still pleases a second time.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he honours the repentant man with <lb/>
            praise, because he has persevered in the same alteration of <lb/>
            manners, and has never receded till he has arrived at com­ <lb/>
            plete perfection of life; for behold, some men appear to be <lb/>
            readily sated after they have only tasted of excellence; and <lb/>
            after a hope of recovery has been given to them, they relapse <lb/>
            again into the same disease.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, ‟ He was not found <lb/>
            because God translated him ?"t</p>
          <p>86. In the first place, the end of virtuous and holy men is <lb/>
            not death but a translation and migration, and an approach to <lb/>
            some other place of abode.</p>
          <p>In the second place, in this instance something marvellous <lb/>
            did take place; for he was supposed to be carried off in such a <lb/>
            way as to be invisible, for then he was not found : and a proof <lb/>
            of this is, that he was sought for as being invisible, not only <lb/>
            as having been carried away from their sight, since translation <lb/>
            into another place is nothing else than a placing of a person <lb/>
            in another situation; but it is here suggested, that he was <lb/>
            translated from a visible place, perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, into an incorporeal idea, appreciable only by the intel­ <lb/>
            lect. This mercy also was bestowed on the great prophet, for <lb/>
            his sepulchre also was known to no one.</p>
          <p>And besides these two there was another, Elijah, whc <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 24. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="330"/>
            ascended from the things of earth into heaven, according to <lb/>
            the divine appearance which was then presented to him, and <lb/>
            who thus followed higher things, or, to speak with more exact <lb/>
            propriety, was raised up to heaven.</p>
          <p>How it was that immediately upon the nativity of Noah his <lb/>
            father says, " He will make us rest from labours and sorrows, <lb/>
            and from the earth, which the Lord God has cursed ?”*</p>
          <p>87. The fathers of the saints did not prophesy except for <lb/>
            grave reasons and on important occasions; for although those <lb/>
            who were rendered worthy of prophetical panegyric did not <lb/>
            prophecy at all times or on all subjects, they did so at all <lb/>
            events on one occasion and on one subject, with which they <lb/>
            were acquainted. Nor is this of no importance, but it is an <lb/>
            emblem and an example, since Noah is a kind of surname of <lb/>
            righteousness, of which, when the intellect is made a partaker, <lb/>
            it causes us to rest from all wicked works, and releases us from <lb/>
            sorrows and from fears, and renders us secure and joyful.</p>
          <p>It also causes us to rest from that earthly nature which has <lb/>
            been previously laid under a curse, which this body, when <lb/>
            affected by pain, is connected with, especially in those persons <lb/>
            who give cause for it, and who wear out their lives with <lb/>
            pleasure. Nevertheless, if we examine attentively the events <lb/>
            and circumstances, and compare them with the letter of the <lb/>
            scriptures, the prophecy which has been already produced is <lb/>
            deceived, because, in the time of this man, there did not arise <lb/>
            any putting down of evils, but a more vehement obstinacy in <lb/>
            sin and great afflictions, and the unprecedented event of the <lb/>
            deluge. But you must note carefully, that Noah is the tenth <lb/>
            in generation from the earth-born Adam.</p>
          <p>What is meant by the three sons of Noah being named <lb/>
            Shem, Ham, and Japhet?*</p>
          <p>88. These names are the symbols of three human things, <lb/>
            what is good, what is bad, and what is indifferent; Shem <lb/>
            is the symbol of what is good, Ham of what is bad, and <lb/>
            Japhet of what is indifferent.</p>
          <p>Why from the time that the deluge drew near, the human <lb/>
            race is said to have increased so as to become a multitude? ‡</p>
          <p>89. Divine mercies do always precede judgment; since <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 29. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis v. 32. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis vi. 1 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            the first work of God is to do good, and to destroy <lb/>
            follows afterwards; but he himself (when terrible evils are <lb/>
            about to happen) loves to provide and is accustomed to <lb/>
            provide that previously an abundance of many and great <lb/>
            blessings shall be produced. On this principle also Egypt, <lb/>
            when there was about to be a barrenness and famine for seven <lb/>
            years as the prophet himself says,* was for an equal number <lb/>
            of years continuously made exceedingly fertile by the benefi­ <lb/>
            cent and saving power of the Creator of the universe.</p>
          <p>And in the same way in which he showers benefits upon <lb/>
            men, he also teaches them to depart and to abstain from sin ; <lb/>
            that these blessings may not be turned into the contrary. <lb/>
            And on this account now, by the freedom of their institutions, <lb/>
            the cities of the world have increased in generous virtue, so <lb/>
            that if any corruption supervenes subsequently they may dis­ <lb/>
            approve of their own acts of wickedness as extraordinary and <lb/>
            irremediable ; not at all looking upon the divinity as the cause <lb/>
            of them, for that has no connection with wickedness or misery, <lb/>
            for the task of the Deity is only to bestow blessings.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " My spirit shall <lb/>
            not always strive with man, because he is but flesh? ” t</p>
          <p>90. An oracle is here promulgated as if it were a law; for <lb/>
            the divine spirit is not a motion of the air, but intellect and <lb/>
            wisdom; just as it also flows over the man who with great <lb/>
            skill constructed the tabernacle of the Lord, namely upon <lb/>
            Bezaleel, when the scripture says, "And he filled him with <lb/>
            the divine spirit of wisdom and understanding." Therefore <lb/>
            that spirit comes upon men, but does not abide or persevere <lb/>
            in them; and the Lord himself adds the reason, when he says, <lb/>
            " Because they are flesh." For the disposition of the flesh is <lb/>
            inconsistent with wisdom, inasmuch as it makes a bond of <lb/>
            alliance with desire ; on which account it is evident that <lb/>
            nothing important can be in the way of incorporeal and light <lb/>
            souls, or can be any hindrance to their discerning and com­ <lb/>
            prehending the condition of nature, because a pure disposition <lb/>
            is acquired together with constancy.</p>
          <p>Why it is said that the days of man shall be a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty years ? ‡</p>
          <p>91. God appears here to fix the limit of human life by <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xli. 28. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis vi. 3. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis vi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            this number, indicating by it the manifold prerogative of <lb/>
            honour; for in the first place this number proceeds from the <lb/>
            units, according to combination, from the number fifteen: <lb/>
            but the principle of the number fifteen is that of a more <lb/>
            transparent appearance, since it is on the fifteenth day that <lb/>
            the moon is rendered full of light, borrowing its light of the <lb/>
            sun at the approach of evening, and restoring it to him again <lb/>
            in the morning; so that during the night of the full moon the <lb/>
            darkness is scarcely visible, but it is all light.</p>
          <p>In the second place, the number a hundred and twenty is a <lb/>
            triangular number, and is the fifteenth number consisting of <lb/>
            triangles.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, it is so because it consists of a combination of odd <lb/>
            and even numbers, being contained by the power of the faculty <lb/>
            of the concurring numbers, sixty-four and fifty-six; for the <lb/>
            equal number of sixty-four is compounded of the uniting of <lb/>
            these eight odd numbers, one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, <lb/>
            thirteen, fifteen; the reduction of which, by their parts into <lb/>
            squares, makes a sum total of sixty-four, and that is a cube, <lb/>
            and at the same time a square number.</p>
          <p>But again from the seven double units there arises the <lb/>
            unequal number of fifty-six, being compounded of seven double <lb/>
            pairs, which generate other productions of them, two, four, six, <lb/>
            eight, ten, twelve, fourteen; the sum total of which is fifty-six.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place, it is compounded of four numbers, of <lb/>
            one triangle, namely fifteen; and of another square, namely <lb/>
            twenty-five ; and of a third quinquangular figure, thirty-five; <lb/>
            and of a fourth a sexangular figure forty-five, by the same <lb/>
            analogy: for the fifth is always received according to each <lb/>
            appearance; for from the unity of the triangles the fifth num­ <lb/>
            ber becomes fifteen; again the fifth of the quadrangular <lb/>
            number from the unit makes twenty-five; and the fifth of <lb/>
            the quinquangular number from the unit makes thirty-five; <lb/>
            and the fifth of the sexangular number from the unit makes <lb/>
            forty-five.</p>
          <p>But every one of these numbers is a divine and sacred <lb/>
            number, consisting of fifteens as has been already shown; and <lb/>
            the number twenty-five belongs to the tribe of Levi.* And <lb/>
            the number thirty-five comes from the double diagram of <lb/>
            arithmetic, geometry, and harmony; but sixteen, and eighteen, <note type="footnote"> * See Numbers viii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            and nineteen, and twenty-one, the combination of which <lb/>
            numbers amounts to seventy-four, is that according to which <lb/>
            seven months’ children are born. And forty-five consists of a <lb/>
            triple diagram ; but to this number, sixteen, nineteen, twenty- <lb/>
            two, and twenty-eight, belong: the combination of which <lb/>
            makes eighty-five, according to which nine months’ children <lb/>
            are produced.</p>
          <p>Fifthly, this diagram has fifteen parts, and a twofold compo­ <lb/>
            sition, peculiarly belonging to itself; forsooth when divided <lb/>
            by two it gives sixty, the measure of the age of all mankind ; <lb/>
            when divided by three it gives forty, the idea of prophecy; <lb/>
            when divided by four it gives thirty, a nation; when divided <lb/>
            by five, it makes twenty-four, the measure of day and night; <lb/>
            when divided by six, it gives twenty, a beginning ; when <lb/>
            divided by eight, we have fifteen, the moon in the fulness of <lb/>
            brilliancy; when divided by ten, it makes twelve, the <lb/>
            zodiac embellished with living animals; when divided by <lb/>
            twelve, it makes ten, holy; when divided by fifteen, it gives <lb/>
            eight, the first ark ; when divided by twenty, it leaves six, the <lb/>
            number of creation; when divided by twenty-four, it makes <lb/>
            five, the emblem of the outward sense; when divided by <lb/>
            thirty it makes four, the beginning of solid measure ; when <lb/>
            divided by forty, it gives three, the symbol of fulness, the <lb/>
            beginning, the middle, and the end; when divided by sixty, <lb/>
            it makes two, which is woman; and when divided by the <lb/>
            whole number of a hundred and twenty, the product is one, or <lb/>
            man.</p>
          <p>And every one of all these numbers is more natural, as is <lb/>
            proved in each of them, but the composition of them is twofold, <lb/>
            for the product is two hundred and forty, which is a sign that <lb/>
            it is worthy of a twofold life; for as the number of years is <lb/>
            doubled, so also we may imagine that the life is doubled too ; <lb/>
            one being in connection with the body, the other being <lb/>
            detached from the body, according to which every holy and <lb/>
            perfect man may receive the gift of prophecy.</p>
          <p>Sixthly, because the fifth and sixth figures arise, the three <lb/>
            numbers being multiplied together, three times four times five, <lb/>
            since three times four times five make sixty ; so in like mail­ <lb/>
            ner the next following numbers four times five times six make <lb/>
            a hundred and twenty, for four times five times six make <lb/>
            a hundred and twenty.</p><pb n="334"/>
            
          <p>Seventhly, when the number twenty has been taken in, <lb/>
            which is the beginning of the reduction of mankind, I mean <lb/>
            twenty, and being added to itself two or three times, so as to <lb/>
            make twenty, forty, and sixty, these added together make a <lb/>
            hundred and twenty. But perhaps the number a hundred and <lb/>
            twenty is not the general term of human life, but only of the <lb/>
            life of those men who existed at that time, and who were to <lb/>
            perish by the deluge after an interval of so many years, which <lb/>
            their kind Benefactor prolonged, giving them space for repent­ <lb/>
            ance; when, after the aforesaid term, they lived a longer time <lb/>
            in the subsequent ages.</p>
          <p>On what principle it was that giants were born of angels and <lb/>
            women ?*</p>
          <p>92. The poets call those men who were born out of the <lb/>
            earth giants, that is to say, sons of the earth.† But Moses <lb/>
            here uses this appellation improperly, and he uses it too very <lb/>
            often merely to denote the vast personal size of the principal <lb/>
            men, equal to that of Hajkt or Hercules.</p>
          <p>But he relates that these giants were sprung from a <lb/>
            combined procreation of two natures, namely, from angels and <lb/>
            mortal women ; for the substance of angels is spiritual; but it <lb/>
            occurs every now and then that on emergencies occurring they <lb/>
            have imitated the appearance of men, and transformed them­ <lb/>
            selves so as to assume the human shape; as they did on this <lb/>
            occasion, when forming connexions with women for the <lb/>
            production of giants. But if the children turn out imitators <lb/>
            of the wickedness of their mothers, departing from the virtue <lb/>
            of their fathers, let them depart, according to the determination <lb/>
            of the will of a depraved race, and because of their proud <lb/>
            contempt for the supreme Deity, and so be condemned as <lb/>
            guilty of voluntary and deliberate wickedness.</p>
          <p>But sometimes Moses styles the angels the sons of God. <lb/>
            inasmuch as they were not produced by any mortal, but are <lb/>
            incorporeal, as being spirits destitute of any body; or rather <lb/>
            that exhorter and teacher of virtue, namely Moses, calls those <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> + T he Greek name <foreign xml:lang="grc">Γίγας</foreign> is said to be derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="grc">γεννάω</foreign>. <lb/>
            “ to bring forth." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Hajk is an addition of the Armenian translator; it is the name of <lb/>

            men who are very excellent and endowed with great virtue the <lb/>
            sons of God; and the wicked and depraved men he calls <lb/>
            bodies, or flesh.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression: " God considered <lb/>
            anxiously, because he had made man upon the earth; and he <lb/>
            resolved the matter in his mind ?" *</p>
          <p>93. Some persons imagine that it is intimated by these <lb/>
            words that the Deity repented; but they are very wrong to <lb/>
            entertain such an idea, since the Deity is unchangeable. <lb/>
            Nor are the facts of his caring and thinking about the matter, <lb/>
            and of his agitating it in his mind, any proofs that he is <lb/>
            repenting, but only indications of a kind and determinate <lb/>
            counsel, according to which he displays care. revolving in his <lb/>
            mind the cause why he had made man upon the eartb.</p>
          <p>But since this earth is a place of misery, even that heavenly <lb/>
            being, man, who is a mixture compounded of soul and body, <lb/>
            from the very hour of his birth to that of bis death, is nothing <lb/>
            else but the slave of the body. That the Deity therefore <lb/>
            should meditate and deliberate on these matters is nothing <lb/>
            surprising; since most men take to themselves wickedness <lb/>
            rather than virtue, being influenced by the twofold impulse <lb/>
            mentioned above; namely, that of a body by its nature <lb/>
            corruptible. and placed in the terrible situation of earth, which <lb/>
            is the lowest of all places.</p>
          <p>Why God. after having threatened to destroy mankind, says <lb/>
            that he will also destroy all the beasts likewise; using the <lb/>
            expression, " from man to beast,t and from creeping things to <lb/>
            flying creatures ;” for how could irrational animals have com­ <lb/>
            mitted sin ?</p>
          <p>94. This is the literal statement of the holy scripture, and <lb/>
            it informs us that animals were not necessarily and in their <lb/>
            primary cause created for their own sake, but for the sake of <lb/>
            mankind and to act as the servants of men ; aud when the <lb/>
            men were destroyed, it followed necessarily and naturally that <lb/>
            they also should be destroyed with them. as soon as the men, <lb/>
            for whose sake they had been made, had ceased to exist. <note type="footnote"> * Genesi, vi. 6. The translation of our bible is, "It repented God <lb/>
            that he had made man upon the earth." </note><note type="footnote"> + Genesis vi. 7. </note> <pb n="336"/>
            </p>
          <p>But as to the hidden meaning conveyed by the statement, <lb/>
            since man is a symbol for the intellect which exists in us, and <lb/>
            animals for the outward sense, when the chief creature has <lb/>
            first been depraved and corrupted by wickedness, all the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense also perishes with him, because he had no relies <lb/>
            whatever of virtue, which is the cause of salvation.</p>
          <p>Why God says, I am indignant that I made them?*</p>
          <p>95. In the first place, Moses is here again relating what <lb/>
            took place, as if he were speaking of some illustrious action of <lb/>
            man, but, properly speaking, God does not feel anger, but is <lb/>
            exempt from, and superior to, all such perturbations of spirit. <lb/>
            Therefore Moses wishes here to point out, by an extravagant <lb/>
            form of expression, that the iniquities of man had grown to <lb/>
            such a height, that they stirred up and provoked to anger even <lb/>
            that very Being who by his nature was incapable of anger.</p>
          <p>In the second place he warns us, by a figure, that foolish <lb/>
            actions are liable to punishment, but that those which proceed <lb/>
            from wise and deliberate counsel are praiseworthy.</p>
          <p>Why it is afterwards said, that Noah found grace in the <lb/>
            sight of the Lord ? t</p>
          <p>96. In the first place, the time calls for a comparison ; since <lb/>
            all the rest of mankind has been rejected for their ingratitude, <lb/>
            he places the just man in the place of them all, asserting that <lb/>
            he had found favour with God, not because he alone was <lb/>
            deserving of favour, when the whole universal body of the <lb/>
            human race had had benefits and mercies heaped on them, but <lb/>
            because he alone had seemed to be mindful of the kindnesses <lb/>
            which he had received.</p>
          <p>In the second place, when the whole generation had been <lb/>
            given over to destruction, with the exception of one single <lb/>
            family, it followed inevitably that that remaining household <lb/>
            should be asserted to have shown itself worthy of the divine <lb/>
            grace, that it might be, as it were, a seed and spark of a new <lb/>
            race of mankind. And what could be a greater grace and <lb/>
            mercy than that the man, of whom this is said, should be at <lb/>
            the same time the end and beginning of the family of <lb/>
            mankind ? <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi 7. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis viA 8, </note></p><pb n="337"/>
            
          <p>Why does Moses enumerate the generations of Noah with <lb/>
            reference not to his ancestors but to his virtues ?*</p>
          <p>97. He does this in the first place, because all the men of <lb/>
            that age were wicked: secondly, he is here imposing a law <lb/>
            upon the will, because, to an anxious follower of virtue, virtue <lb/>
            itself stands in the place of a real generation, if indeed men <lb/>
            are the means of the generation of men, but the virtues of <lb/>
            minds. And on this account it is that he says, be was a <lb/>
            just man, perfect, and one who pleased God; but justice, and <lb/>
            perfection, and grace before God, are the greatest of virtues.</p>
          <p>What was the meaning of Moses when he says, " And all <lb/>
            the earth was corrupt in the sight of God, and the earth was <lb/>
            filled with iniquity ?"f</p>
          <p>98. Moses himself has given us the reason why he speaks <lb/>
            thus, in the sentence in which he asserts that iniquity had <lb/>
            arisen by reason of the corruption of the earth; for deliverance <lb/>
            from iniquity is righteousness, both in all the parts of the <lb/>
            world, in heaven, that is, and earth, and among men.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of his saying, " All flesh had cor­ <lb/>
            rupted his way upon the earth ?”‡</p>
          <p>99. In the first place, the sacred historian calls the man who <lb/>
            is devoted to the love of himself, flesh; therefore, when he <lb/>
            had already said he was flesh, he introduces not the same <lb/>
            flesh, but the flesh of the same being, namely, of man, or per­ <lb/>
            haps he is speaking even of man abstractedly considered; for <lb/>
            every one who passes a life destitute of all civilisation, and <lb/>
            bewildered by intemperance, is flesh.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he supposes here the cause of spiritual <lb/>
            corruption to be, as in truth it is, the flesh, because that is <lb/>
            the seat of desire; and from it, as from a living spring, arise <lb/>
            all the peculiar appetites, and passions, and other affections.</p>
          <p>In the third place, he very naturally says, that all flesh had <lb/>
            corrupted his way; for " his" is a partial case, declined from <lb/>
            the nominative case of the pronoun " he, she, or it;" for as for <lb/>
            the being to whom we refer honour, we scarcely dare to speak <lb/>
            of him by his own name, but we call him He. And it is from <lb/>
            this that the principle of the Pythagorean philosophers was <lb/>

            glorious manner, since they feared to speak of him by name. <lb/>
            And the same custom has obtained in cities and in private <lb/>
            houses; for the servants, when speaking of the arrival of their <lb/>
            master, say, " Here he comes;" and so when the prince of any <lb/>
            individual city arrives, they use the same form of speech, " He <lb/>
            comes," when they speak of him.</p>
          <p>But what is the purpose of this prolix enumeration of all <lb/>
            these instances on my part? The truth is, that I wished to <lb/>
            show that it is the Father of the universe who is spoken of <lb/>
            here; since, indeed, all his good qualities, and all his marvel­ <lb/>
            lous names, are widely celebrated by the praise bestowed upon <lb/>
            the virtues; and, therefore, out of reverence he has used that <lb/>
            name more cautiously, because he was about to bring on the <lb/>
            world the destruction of the flood; but the case of the pronoun <lb/>
            " He" is used by way of honour in these phrases. " All flesh <lb/>
            had corrupted His way," inasmuch as it is truly convicted of <lb/>
            having corrupted the way of the Father, in accordance with <lb/>
            the lusts, and desires, and pleasures of the body; for these are <lb/>
            the enemies and opposers of the laws of continence, and par­ <lb/>
            simony, and chastity, and fortitude, and justice; by which the <lb/>
            road which leads to God is found out and widened, so that it <lb/>
            should everywhere be a beaten and plain road.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, "All the time of man <lb/>
            has come against me, because the earth is filled with iniquity?"*</p>
          <p>100. Those who resist the order of fate proceed upon these <lb/>
            and many other arguments, especially in that of sudden death, <lb/>
            which oftentimes produces great slaughter in a short period of <lb/>
            time; as, for instance, in the overthrow of houses, in confla­ <lb/>
            grations, in shipwrecks, in civil tumults, in battles of cavalry, <lb/>
            in wars by land and in wars by sea, and in pestilences. To <lb/>
            all those who advance arguments of this kind we repeat the <lb/>
            same assertions which are here made by the prophet, on the <lb/>
            principle which is derived from himself. If indeed that ex­ <lb/>
            pression, " All the time of man has come against me," has a <lb/>
            meaning of this kind, the term which has been determined as <lb/>
            the period of living for all mankind, behold it is now brought <lb/>
            to one point and terminated at once by the deluge; and since <lb/>
            this is the case, they will not live any longer according to the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 13. The version given here does not in the least <lb/>
            resemble that in our Bible. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            principle of fate which has been fixed; so that the time of <lb/>
            each separate individual is now reduced to one, and has <lb/>
            received its destined termination at the same time, by I know <lb/>
            not what harmony and periodical revolution of the stars, by <lb/>
            which bodies the whole race of mankind is continually pre­ <lb/>
            served or destroyed. Let those, therefore, all receive these <lb/>
            things in any manner in which they choose who study these <lb/>
            things, and those too who argue against them.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless we must first of all make this statement, that <lb/>
            nothing can be found so contrary to, so opposite to, so wholly <lb/>
            repugnant to, the wonderful virtue of the Deity as iniquity; <lb/>
            therefore, after he said, " All the time of all mankind has come <lb/>
            up against me," he adds also the reason of its contrariety to <lb/>
            him, that the earth is filled with iniquity.</p>
          <p>In the second place, Time, under the name of Chronos or <lb/>
            Saturn, is looked upon as a god by the wickedest of men, who <lb/>
            are desirous to lose sight of the one essential Being, on which <lb/>
            account he says, " The time of all mankind has come up <lb/>
            against me," because in fact the heathen make human time <lb/>
            into a god, and oppose him to the real true God. But, how­ <lb/>
            ever, it is now insinuated, in other passages also of scripture, <lb/>
            which run thus, " Time has departed to a distance from them, <lb/>
            but the Lord is in us just as if he were to say, time is <lb/>
            looked upon by wicked men as the cause of the world, but by <lb/>
            wise men and virtuous men time is not looked upon in this <lb/>
            light, but God only, from whom all times and seasons do <lb/>
            proceed.</p>
          <p>Again, God is the cause, not of all things, but only of good <lb/>
            things and good men, and of those men and things which are <lb/>
            in accordance with virtue; for as he is free from all wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, so likewise he cannot be the cause of it.</p>
          <p>In the third place, by that expression which he uses in this <lb/>
            manner, he indicates the excess of impiety, saying, ‟ that the <lb/>
            time of all mankind has arrived," that is to say, that all men, <lb/>
            in every part of the world, have agreed together, with one <lb/>
            mind, to work wickedness; but the other assertion which is <lb/>
            here made, that the whole earth is filled with iniquity, amounts <lb/>
            to this, that there is no part of it whatever free from wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, and which is also to receive and to bear righteousness. <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xiv. 9. Compare with this Isaiah viii., Jeremiah xlvi. <lb/>

             <pb n="340"/>
            And the expression, " against me," establishes the proof of <lb/>
            what has been said, inasmuch as it is only the judgment of <lb/>
            divine election which is altogether firm and lasting.</p>

          <p>WHAT is the preparation of Noah ?*</p>
          <p>1. If any one should wish to make an examination of the <lb/>
            question of that ark of Noah's on more natural principles, he <lb/>
            will find it to have been the preparation of the human body, <lb/>
            as we shall see by the examination of each particular respect­ <lb/>
            ing it separately.</p>
          <p>Why does he make the ark of squared pieces of wood ?f</p>
          <p>2. He does this in the first place, because the figure of a <lb/>
            square, wherever it may be placed, is steady and firm, consist­ <lb/>
            ing as it does of right angles, and it is confirmed in a purer and <lb/>
            clearer manner by the nature of the human body.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he does this because, although our body <lb/>
            is an instrument, and although every portion of it is rounded <lb/>
            off, nevertheless the limbs which are compounded of all these <lb/>
            portions do, by some manner or other, evidently reduce that <lb/>
            circular orb to the figure of a quadrangle or square. For ex­ <lb/>
            ample, take the breast which is rather square than circular; <lb/>
            in the same manner take the belly, after it is swollen with <lb/>
            food or by any natural excess, for there are some men pot­ <lb/>
            bellied by nature, who are to be excepted from our present <lb/>
            argument. But if any one looks upon the arms and hands, <lb/>
            and back and thighs, and feet of a man, he will find all these <lb/>
            limbs compounded of a mixture of the square, with the cir­ <lb/>
            cular figure at the same time.</p>
          <p>In the third place, a quadrangular piece of wood shows in its <lb/>
            extension nearly every sort imaginable of uneven distinction, <lb/>
            inasmuch as its length is greater than its breadth, and its <lb/>
            breadth greater than its depth. And such also is the forma­ <lb/>
            tion of our bodies, which are compounded of one extension <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 14. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis vi. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            which is great, of another which is of moderate size, of another <lb/>
            which is small, great in its length and small in its depth.</p>
          <p>Why does God say, you shall make the ark in nests ?*</p>
          <p>3. He gives this order very naturally, for the human body <lb/>
            is formed of holes like nests ; every one of which is nourished <lb/>
            and grows like a young bird, a certain spiritual force which ex­ <lb/>
            ists in it from its earliest origin penetrating through it, as, for <lb/>
            instance, some of the holes and nests are the eyes, in which <lb/>
            the faculty of sight has its abode; other nests are the ears, <lb/>
            which are the place where hearing is situated. A third class <lb/>
            of nests are the nostrils, in which the sense of smell is <lb/>
            lodged. The fourth nest, which is of larger dimensions than <lb/>
            those already mentioned, is the mouth, which is the seat of <lb/>
            the taste; and it has been made of large size, since, besides <lb/>
            taste, there is also another still more important instrument, <lb/>
            which is that of articulate speech, reposing in it, namely, the <lb/>
            tongue, which, as Socrates was wont to say, by beating in <lb/>
            every direction in various manners, and by touching different <lb/>
            parts, composes and forms a word, being, in truth, an instru­ <lb/>
            ment under the immediate guidance of reason.</p>
          <p>And the nest is placed under the skull, and that which is <lb/>
            called the membrane of the brain is a certain nest, as it were, <lb/>
            of the genius of each man: as also the chest is a nest, in <lb/>
            which abide the lungs and the heart, and both these things <lb/>
            are receptacles of other internal organs; the lungs being the <lb/>
            place in which the power of breathing is lodged, and the heart <lb/>
            being the abode of both the blood and the breath, for it has <lb/>
            two venticles, which are, as it were, a certain kind of nests or <lb/>
            receptacles in the breast; blood, from which the veins, as if <lb/>
            they could perceive its operations, are irrigated; and a breath­ <lb/>
            ing-hole, which again is extended over and irrigates the per­ <lb/>
            ceptive channels of respiration.</p>
          <p>And both the harder as well as the softer parts do, like <lb/>
            nests prepared for the purpose, nourish the bones as real nests <lb/>
            nourish young birds; the harder portion of which, namely, <lb/>
            the marrow, is the nest, and the softer flesh is the nest of <lb/>
            pleasure and pain; and if any one should wish to investigate <lb/>
            the other parts, he will find that, in every respect, the nature <lb/>
            of man has much the same foundation as the ark. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 14. The word in our Bible is rooms, not nests. </note> <pb n="342"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why does God command the ark to be smeared with pitch, <lb/>
            both on the inside and on the outside ?*</p>
          <p>4. Pitch is so called by reason of its bird-lime like tenacity, <lb/>
            because it glues together whatever was disunited before, so as <lb/>
            to form one indissoluble and indivisible joint. For everything <lb/>
            which is held together by bird-lime is immediately held to a <lb/>
            natural union; but our body being composed of many parts is <lb/>
            united on the outside, and is held together by its own proper <lb/>
            habit, but the previous habit of connection which binds those <lb/>
            things together is the soul, which, being situated in the middle, <lb/>
            penetrates through every part till it reaches the surface, and <lb/>
            then is turned back again from the surface to the centre, so <lb/>
            that our spiritual nature is rolled up compactly in a double <lb/>
            fold, being united in a firm solidity and union.</p>
          <p>Therefore this ark is smeared with pitch, both on the inside <lb/>
            and the outside, for the reason here given.</p>
          <p>But that ark which is placed in the holy of holies, and is <lb/>
            covered over with gold, is the similitude of the world ap­ <lb/>
            preciable only by the intellect, as is declared in the account <lb/>
            given of it: since just as there is a world appreciable by the <lb/>
            intellect incarnate in incorporeal figures existing at the same <lb/>
            time, consisting of a union of all figures by a certain invisible <lb/>
            harmony ; for, in proportion as gold is a more noble material <lb/>
            than pitch, in the same ratio is that ark, which is in the holy <lb/>
            of holies, superior to this one of which we are now speaking.</p>
          <p>And again, God ordained that its measure should be qua­ <lb/>
            drangular, from a regard to usefulness; but his object in the <lb/>
            other ark was not so much that it should be useful as that it <lb/>
            should be exempt from all possibility of decay; for the nature <lb/>
            of incorporeal things, appreciable only by the intellect, is to be <lb/>
            exempt from decay, being incorruptible and permanent. The <lb/>
            one ark is tossed to and fro by the winds and the waters, but <lb/>
            the other has its station constantly in the holy of holies; and <lb/>
            being stable it is akin to divine nature, as the other, which is <lb/>
            tossed about in every direction, and moved from one place to <lb/>
            another, is akin to and the emblem of created nature. Besides <lb/>
            this, that ark of the flood being, as it were, an example of cor­ <lb/>
            ruption, is raised on high, but the other, which is in the holy <lb/>
            of holies, imitates the incorruptible condition of eternity <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 14. </note> <pb n="343"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why did God give the measures of the ark in the following <lb/>
            manner; the length to be of three hundred cubits, and the <lb/>
            breadth thereof to be fifty cubits, and the height to be thirty <lb/>
            cubits : and above it was to be raised to a point in one cubit, <lb/>
            being brought together gradually like an obelisk ? *</p>
          <p>5. It was necessary that so vast a work should be con­ <lb/>
            structed in conformity with literal directions, in order that so <lb/>
            many animals, some of them of vast size, should be received <lb/>
            into it, as indviduals of each class were introduced with the <lb/>
            food necessary for them; but if the matter is considered pro­ <lb/>
            perly with reference to its symbolical meaning, then, for the <lb/>
            comprehension of the formation of our body, we shall require <lb/>
            to make use not of the quantity of cubits, but of the certain <lb/>
            principles and proportions which are observed in them.</p>
          <p>But the proportions which are contained in them are of <lb/>
            sixfold, and double, and other portions are added. For three <lb/>
            hundred is six times as many as fifty, and ten times as many <lb/>
            as thirty; and again fifty is by two thirds a larger number than <lb/>
            thirty. Such then are also the proportions of the body; for if <lb/>
            any one should choose to investigate the matter and inquire <lb/>
            into it carefully in all its points, he will find that man is <lb/>
            made in an exact proportion of measurement, neither being <lb/>
            too long or too little; and if a string be let down from his <lb/>
            head to his feet, he will find that to reach that distance it <lb/>
            requires a string six times as long as the width of his chest, <lb/>
            and ten times as long as the depth of his ribs and thei r <lb/>
            breadth as a second part of depth added thereto. Such is the <lb/>
            certain proportion, received in accordance with nature, of the <lb/>
            human body formed on exact measurement of the most excel­ <lb/>
            lently made men, who are incorrect neither in the way of <lb/>
            excess nor of defect.</p>
          <p>But again, it was with great wisdom and propriety that God <lb/>
            ordained the summit to be completed in cne cubit; for the <lb/>
            upper part of the ark imitates the unity of the body; the <lb/>
            head being forsooth as the citadel of the king, having for its <lb/>
            inhabitant the chief of all, the intellect.</p>
          <p>But those parts which are below the head are divided into <lb/>
            separate portions, as for instance into the hands, and in an <lb/>
            especial degree into the lower parts, since the thighs, and legs, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            and feet are all kept distinct from one another, therefore who­ <lb/>
            ever should wish to understand these matters, on the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple which I have pointed out, will easily comprehend the <lb/>
            analogy of the cubits as I have related it.</p>
          <p>But above all things he must not be ignorant that each of <lb/>
            these different numbers of cubits has separately a certain ne­ <lb/>
            cessary proportion and principle, beginning with the first, <lb/>
            those in the length of the ark. Therefore in its length it is <lb/>
            composed of three hundred units, placed next to one another <lb/>
            in continuation, according to the augmentation of units, from <lb/>
            these twenty-four numbers, one, two, three, four, five, six, <lb/>
            seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, <lb/>
            fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty- <lb/>
            one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four. But the twenty- <lb/>
            fourth number is above all others a natural number, being <lb/>
            distributed among the hours of day and night, and also among <lb/>
            the characters of language,* and literal speech; and it is also com­ <lb/>
            pounded of three cubes, being complete, full, and compacted <lb/>
            in equality.</p>
          <p>For the number three constantly exhibits, as belonging to <lb/>
            itself, the first equality of all, having a beginning, and a mid­ <lb/>
            dle, and an end, all of which are equal to one another; and <lb/>
            eight is the first cube, because it again has declared its first <lb/>
            equality with the rest.</p>
          <p>But the number twenty-four has likewise a great number of <lb/>
            other virtues, since it is the substance of the number three <lb/>
            hundred, as has been already pointed out; this then is its first <lb/>
            virtue; and it has another, since it is compounded of twelve <lb/>
            quadrangular figures, joined to one another by a continuous <lb/>
            unity; and besides of two long figures, and twelve double <lb/>
            figures, being forsooth compounded of twos separately increased <lb/>
            by two and two.</p>
          <p>Therefore the angular numbers which make up together the <lb/>
            twelve quadrangular figures are these; one, three, five, seven, <lb/>
            nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, <lb/>
            and twenty-three; but the quadrangular figure combines the <lb/>
            following numbers, one, four, nine, sixteen, twenty-five, <lb/>
            thirty-six, forty-nine, sixty-four, eighty-one, a hundred, a <lb/>
            hundred and twenty-one, and a hundred and twenty-four. <note type="footnote"> * He is referring to the Greek alphabet, which consists of twenty- <lb/>
            four letters. </note> <pb n="345"/>
            </p>
          <p>But those angular numbers which compose the other long <lb/>
            figures are these; one, four, six, eight, ten, twelve, fourteen, <lb/>
            sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, being <lb/>
            twelve in all; and after these come the compound numbers, <lb/>
            two, six, twelve, twenty, thirty, forty-two, fifty-six, seventy-two, <lb/>
            ninety, a hundred and ten, a hundred and thirty-two, and a <lb/>
            hundred and fifty-six; being also twelve. And if you put <lb/>
            together the twelve quadrangular figures, you will find a hun­ <lb/>
            dred and forty-four, and if you add the other twelve long <lb/>
            figures, you will find a hundred and fifty-six; and from the <lb/>
            combination of the two you will get the number three hundred, <lb/>
            and the concord of full, and complete, and perfect nature <lb/>
            rising up to the equal and infinite harmony; for a complete and <lb/>
            perfect nature is the maker of equality, according to the <lb/>
            nature of a triangle; but the equal and the infinite are the <lb/>
            factors of inequality, according to the composition of the other <lb/>
            long figure.</p>
          <p>But the universe consists of a combination of equality and <lb/>
            inequality, on which account the Creator himself, even amid <lb/>
            the destruction of all earthly things, placed a sort of fixed <lb/>
            pattern of stability in the ark.</p>
          <p>This then is enough to say about the number three hundred. <lb/>
            We must now proceed to speak of the fifty cubits, on the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing principle ; for in the first place it is composed of the <lb/>
            right angle of the quadrangular figures; for a right angle is <lb/>
            compounded of three, four, and five ; and the square of these, <lb/>
            is nine, sixteen, and twenty-five, the sum total of which when <lb/>
            added together is fifty; in the second place, the perfect <lb/>
            number fifty is composed of these four triangles linked toge­ <lb/>
            ther, one, three, six, ten; and again of these four equal <lb/>
            quadrangles also united together, one, four, nine, sixteen ; <lb/>
            therefore these triangles when collected together make twenty; <lb/>
            and the quadrangles make thirty; and twenty and thirty <lb/>
            added together make fifty.</p>
          <p>But if the triangle and the quadrangle are added together, <lb/>
            they make a heptangular figure: so that it is contained by its <lb/>
            virtue in the number of fifty, that divine and holy number; to <lb/>
            which the prophet had regard when he proclaimed the jubilee <lb/>
            festival; and the whole of the jubilee year is free and a deliverer.</p>
          <p>The third theorem is three triangles beginning with the <lb/>
            unit, connected together in a continuous series, and three <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            cubes beginning also with the unit, and connected together in <lb/>
            a similar manner, which together make fifty; the examples of <lb/>
            the first are one, four, and nine, which make fourteen ; the ex­ <lb/>
            amples of the second are, one, eight, and twenty-seven, which <lb/>
            together make thirty-six ; and the sum total of the two when <lb/>
            added together is fifty.</p>
          <p>Again, thirty is in an especial manner a natural number, for <lb/>
            as in the series of units the number three is, so is the number <lb/>
            thirty in the series of decimals ; and that makes up the cycle <lb/>
            of the moon, being the collection of separate months in full <lb/>
            delineation ; secondly, it is composed of four numbers, which are <lb/>
            united in the continual series of these quadrangular figures, <lb/>
            one, four, nine, and sixteen, which together make up thirty; <lb/>
            on which account it was not without some foundation and <lb/>
            sufficient reason that Heraclitus called that number " genera­ <lb/>
            tion," when he said: a man in thirty years from the time of <lb/>
            his birth can become a grandfather, inasmuch as he arrives at <lb/>
            the age of puberty in his fourteenth year, at which age he is <lb/>
            capable of becoming a father; and at the end of the year his <lb/>
            offspring arrives at the birth, and again in fifteen years more <lb/>
            begets another offspring like himself; and out of these names <lb/>
            of grandfathers, fathers, and sons, as also out of the names of <lb/>
            grandmothers, mothers, and daughters, a generation complete <lb/>
            in its offspring is produced.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of a door in the side: for he says, <lb/>
            ‟Thou shalt make a door in the side ? ” *</p>
          <p>6. That door in the side very plainly betokens a human <lb/>
            building, which he has becomingly indicated by calling it, ‟ in <lb/>
            the side," by which door all the excrements of dung are cast <lb/>
            out. In truth, as Socrates says, whether because he learnt it <lb/>
            from Moses or because he was influenced by the facts them­ <lb/>
            selves, the Creator, having due regard to the decency of our <lb/>
            body, has placed the exit and passage of the different ducts of <lb/>
            the body back out of the reach of the sense, in order that <lb/>
            while getting rid of the fetid portions of bile, we might not be <lb/>
            disgusted by beholding the full appearance of our excrements. <lb/>
            Therefore he has surrounded that passage by the back and <lb/>
            posteriors, which project out like hills, as also the buttocks arc <lb/>
            made soft for other objects. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 16. </note> <pb n="347"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why has he said that the lower part of the ark was to be <lb/>
            made with two and with three stories ?*</p>
          <p>7. He has here admirably indicated the receptacles of food, <lb/>
            calling them the inner parts of the house ; since food is corrup­ <lb/>
            tible, and what is corruptible belongs to the inward part, be­ <lb/>
            cause it is borne downwards, since some small portions of <lb/>
            meat and drink which we take are borne upwards, but the <lb/>
            greater part is secreted and cast out into dung; and the intes­ <lb/>
            tines have been made in two and in three stories, because of the <lb/>
            providence of the Creator in order to supply abundant support <lb/>
            to his creatures; for if he had made the receptacles of food <lb/>
            and its passage having a direct communication between the <lb/>
            bowels and the buttocks, some awkward circumstances must <lb/>
            have taken place ; in the first place there would have been a <lb/>
            frequent deficiency, and want and hunger, and sudden <lb/>
            evacuations also arising from divers unseasonable events; in <lb/>
            the second place there would have been an immense hunger, <lb/>
            for when the receptacles are emptied, it is inevitable that hun­ <lb/>
            ger and thirst must immediately supervene, like absolute mis­ <lb/>
            tresses in difficulty from pregnancy, and then it follows also <lb/>
            that the pleasant appetite for food must be perverted into <lb/>
            greediness and into an unphilosophical state; for nothing is <lb/>
            so very inconvenient as for the belly to be empty.</p>
          <p>And in the third place, there will be death waiting at the <lb/>
            door; since those persons must speedily be overtaken by death <lb/>
            who the very moment that they have done eating begin again <lb/>
            to be hungry, and the moment that they have drunk are again <lb/>
            thirsty, and who before they are thoroughly filled are again <lb/>
            evacuated and oppressed by hunger ; but owing to the long <lb/>
            coils and windings of the bowels we are delivered from all <lb/>
            feelings of hunger, from all greediness, and from being prema­ <lb/>
            turely overtaken by death; for while the food which has been <lb/>
            taken remains within us, not for such a time only as the dis­ <lb/>
            tance to be passed requires, but for so long as was necessary <lb/>
            for us, a change in it is effected; since by the pressure to <lb/>
            which it is subjected, the strength of the food is extracted in <lb/>
            the first instance in the belly; then it is warmed in the liver, <lb/>
            and drawn out; after that whatever predominant flavour there <lb/>
            was is emitted upwards to the separate parts, in the case of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            boys in order to contribute to their growth, and in the case of <lb/>
            full-grown men to add to their strength ; and then nature, col­ <lb/>
            lecting the remaining portions into dung and excrement, casts <lb/>
            them out.</p>
          <p>Therefore a great deal of time is necessarily required for the <lb/>
            arrangement of so many and such important affairs, nature <lb/>
            effecting its operations without difficulty by perseverance.</p>
          <p>Moreover the ark itself appears to me to be very fitly com­ <lb/>
            pared to the human body; for as nature is exceedingly prolific <lb/>
            of living creatures, for that very reason it has prepared an <lb/>
            opposite receptacle similar to the earth for the creatures cor­ <lb/>
            rupted and destroyed by the flood; for whatever was alive and <lb/>
            supported on the earth, the ark now bore within itself in a <lb/>
            more general manner, and on that account God ordained it, <lb/>
            being borne upon the waters as it was, to be as it were like the <lb/>
            earth, a mother and a nurse, and to exhibit the fathers of the <lb/>
            subsequent race as if pregnant with it, together with the sun <lb/>
            and moon, and the remaining multitude of the stars, and all <lb/>
            the host of heaven; because men beholding by means of that <lb/>
            which was made by art, a comparison and analogy to the human <lb/>
            body, might in that manner be more manifestly taught, for <lb/>
            this was the cause of the various disputes among mankind; <lb/>
            since there is nothing which has so much contributed to keep <lb/>
            man in a servile condition as the essential humours of the <lb/>
            body, and the defects which arise in consequence of them, and <lb/>
            most especially the vicious pleasures and desires.</p>
          <p>Why does he say that the deluge will be to the corrupting of all <lb/>
            flesh in which there is the breath of life beneath the heaven?*</p>
          <p>8. One may almost say that what he had previously spoken <lb/>
            in riddles he has now made plain; for there was no other <lb/>
            cause for the corruption of mankind, except that, being slaves <lb/>
            to pleasure and to desire, they did everything, and were <lb/>
            anxious about everything for that reason only ; moreover they <lb/>
            passed a life of extreme misery.</p>
          <p>But he added also, in a very natural manner, the place <lb/>
            where the breath of life is, using the expression, " under hea­ <lb/>
            ven," because forsooth there are living beings also in heaven; <lb/>
            for a happy body has not been made out of a heavenly sub­ <lb/>
            stance, as if in truth it had received some peculiar and admi­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            rable condition, superior to that of other living creatures, but <lb/>
            heaven appears to have been made especially worthy of and for <lb/>
            the sake of these admirable and divine living beings, all of <lb/>
            which are intellectual spirits; so that they give a share and <lb/>
            participation in themselves and in the essence of vitality even <lb/>
            to the creatures which exist upon the earth, and give life to <lb/>
            all those which are capable of receiving it.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, all things which existed upon the earth shall <lb/>
            be consumed ; for what sin can the beasts commit? *</p>
          <p>9. In the first place, as, when a sovereign is slain in battle <lb/>
            the military valour of the kingdom is also crushed, so also he <lb/>
            now has thought it reasonable that when the whole human <lb/>
            race, bearing analogy to a sovereign, is destroyed, he should <lb/>
            also destroy simultaneously with it the species of beasts like­ <lb/>
            wise, on which account also in pestilences the beasts die first, <lb/>
            and especially those which are bred up with and associate <lb/>
            with men, such as dogs and similar animals, and afterwards <lb/>
            the men die too.</p>
          <p>In the second place, as, when the head is cut off, no one <lb/>
            blames nature if the other portions of the body also, numerous <lb/>
            and important as they are, are destroyed along with it, so too <lb/>
            now no one can find fault with anything, since man is as it <lb/>
            were the head and chief of all animals, and when he is de­ <lb/>
            stroyed it is not at all strange if all the rest of the beasts are <lb/>
            destroyed also along with him.</p>
          <p>In the third place, animals were originally made, not for <lb/>
            their own sakes, as has been said by the philosophers, but in <lb/>
            order to do service to mankind, and for their use and glory; <lb/>
            therefore it is very reasonable that when those beings are de­ <lb/>
            stroyed for the sake of whom they had their existence, they <lb/>
            also should be deprived of life, and this is the reason of this <lb/>
            assertion in its literal sense; but with respect to its hidden <lb/>
            meaning we may say, when the soul is exposed to a deluge <lb/>
            from the overflow of vices, and is in a manner stifled by them, <lb/>
            those portions also which are on the earth, the earthly parts I <lb/>
            mean of the body, must of necessity likewise perish along with <lb/>
            it; for life passed in wickedness is death; the eyes though <lb/>
            they see perish, inasmuch as they see wrongly; the ears also <lb/>
            though they hear perish, inasmuch as they hear wrongly; and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            the whole body of the senses perishes, inasmuch as they are all <lb/>
            exercised wrongly.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, I will set up my <lb/>
            treaty with you ?*</p>
          <p>10. In the first place, he here warns us that no man is the <lb/>
            inheritor of the divine substance, except him who is endowed <lb/>
            with virtue; since the inheritance of men is possessed when <lb/>
            they themselves are no longer in existence, but when they are <lb/>
            dead ; but as God is everlasting he grants a participation in <lb/>
            his inheritance to wise men, rejoicing at their entering into <lb/>
            possession of it; for he who has entered into possession of <lb/>
            everything is in want of nothing, but they who are in distress <lb/>
            from a want of all things are in the possession of no portion <lb/>
            of truth.</p>
          <p>And on this account God, showing himself favourable to the <lb/>
            virtuous, benefits them, bestowing on them those things of <lb/>
            which they have need.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he bestows on the wise man a certain <lb/>
            and more ample inheritance ; for he does not say, I will set up <lb/>
            my treaty for you, but with you ; that is to say, you are your­ <lb/>
            self a just and true treaty, which I will set up for the race <lb/>
            endued with reason, who have need of virtue, for a possession <lb/>
            and a glory to them.</p>
          <p>Why does he say : " Enter thou and all thy house into the <lb/>
            ark, because I have seen that thou art a just man before me in <lb/>
            that generation ? " †</p>
          <p>11. In the first place, certain faith receives approbation, <lb/>
            inasmuch as for the sake of one man who is just and worthy <lb/>
            many men are saved by reason of their relationship to him; <lb/>
            as is the case too with sailors and armies, when the one have <lb/>
            a good captain and the others an excellent and skilful general.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he extols the just man with praise, who <lb/>
            thus acquires virtues, not for himself alone, but also for his <lb/>
            whole family, which in this way deserves safety. And it is <lb/>
            with peculiar propriety that this expression is added, namely, <lb/>
            " I have seen that thou art a just man before me;" for men <lb/>
            approve of the life of any one upon one principle, and God on <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi..9. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis vii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            quite a different one; for they judge by what is visible, but he <lb/>
            derives his tests from the invisible designs of the soul.</p>
          <p>Moreover, that is a very remarkable expression which is <lb/>
            added as an insertion, namely, the one which says, " I have <lb/>
            seen that thou art a just man in this generation;" that he <lb/>
            might not appear to condemn those who had gone before, nor <lb/>
            cut off the future hope of coming generations. This is the <lb/>
            sense of the passage taken according to the letter.</p>
          <p>But if we look at its inward meaning, when God will save <lb/>
            the intellect of the soul, which is the principal part of the <lb/>
            man, that is to say, the head of the family, then also he will <lb/>
            save the whole family along with him; I mean all the parts, <lb/>
            and all those who bear an analogy to the parts, and to the <lb/>
            word which is uttered, and to the circumstances of the body; <lb/>
            for what the intellect is in the soul, that also is the soul in the <lb/>
            body. All the parts of the soul are in good condition, owing <lb/>
            to the result of counsels, and all its family derives the benefit <lb/>
            along with it. But when the whole soul is in a good condition, <lb/>
            then also its habitation is again found to be benefited by its <lb/>
            advantages, that is to say, the body is benefited by purity of <lb/>
            morals and sobriety, those overstrained desires which are the <lb/>
            causes of diseases being cut off.</p>
          <p>Why does he order seven of each of the clean animals, male <lb/>
            and female, to be taken into the ark, but of the unclean animals <lb/>
            only two, male and female, in order to preserve seed upon all <lb/>
            the earth?</p>
          <p>12. By divine ordinance he has asserted the number <lb/>
            seven to be clean, and the number two to be unclean; since <lb/>
            the number seven is clean by nature, inasmuch as that is <lb/>
            a virgin number, free from all admixture, and without any <lb/>
            parent. Nor does it generate any thing, nor is it generated, <lb/>
            as each of those numbers which are below the number ten, on <lb/>
            account of their similitude to the unit, because it is uncreated <lb/>
            and unbegotten, and nothing is generated by it, although it is <lb/>
            itself the cause of creation and generation; because it rouses <lb/>
            the virtues of all things which are well-arranged, for the gene­ <lb/>
            ration of created beings.</p>
          <p>But the number two is not clean. In the first place, <lb/>
            because it is empty, not solid; and because it is not full, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            therefore neither is it clean; because it is likewise the begin. <lb/>
            ning of infinite immensity by reason of its materiality. It also <lb/>
            labours under inequality on account of the other long numbers; <lb/>
            for all the other numbers after two which are increased in a <lb/>
            twofold proportion are long numbers. But that which is un­ <lb/>
            equal is not clean, as neither is that which is material; but <lb/>
            that which proceeds from such is fallible and inelegant, being <lb/>
            destitute of the purity of reason to conduct it to completeness <lb/>
            and perfection; and it conducts it to such by its own intrinsic <lb/>
            power, and by songs of harmony and equality.</p>
          <p>This is enough to say on the physical part of the subject; it <lb/>
            remains for us to speak of its moral bearings.</p>
          <p>The irrational parts of our soul which are destitute of <lb/>
            intellect are divided into seven; that is to say, into the five <lb/>
            senses, and the vocal organ, and the seminal organ. Now <lb/>
            these in a man endued with virtue are all clean, and by nature <lb/>
            feminine, inasmuch as they belong to the irrational species; <lb/>
            but to a man who has come into full possession of his inherit­ <lb/>
            ance they are masculine; for men endued with virtue are also <lb/>
            the parents of the virtue of counsel to themselves, the best part of <lb/>
            them not permitting them to come to the external senses in a <lb/>
            precipitate and unbridled manner, but repressing them and <lb/>
            leading them back to right reason.</p>
          <p>But in the wicked man there exists a twofold wickedness; <lb/>
            since the unjust man is full of doubts and perplexities, as a <lb/>
            hesitating person, mingling things which ought not to be mixed, <lb/>
            and connecting them with one another, confounding those <lb/>
            things which may very easily be kept separate. Such are <lb/>
            those passions which imbue the soul with some particular <lb/>
            colour, like a man spotted and leprous in body, the originally <lb/>
            sound counsel being infected and contaminated by that which <lb/>
            is destructive and fatal. But the principle of the entrance and <lb/>
            of the custody of animals is added in a natural manner; for <lb/>
            he says, " for the sake of nourishing seed." If we take the <lb/>
            expression according to the letter, inasmuch as, although <lb/>
            particular individuals may be destroyed, still at least a race is <lb/>
            preserved to be the seed of future generations; forsooth that <lb/>
            the intention of God, conceived at the formation of the world, <lb/>
            might remain for ever and ever unextinguishable, the different <lb/>
            races of creatures being preserved.</p>
          <p>But if we regard the inward meaning of the words, it is <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            necessary that in the irrational parts of the soul, likewise, <lb/>
            there should be motions which are clean, as certain seminal <lb/>
            principles, although the animals themselves are not clean; <lb/>
            since the nature of mankind is capable of admitting contrarieties, <lb/>
            for instance, virtue and wickedness ; each of which he deline­ <lb/>
            ated at the creation of the world, by the tree bearing the name <lb/>
            of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Forsooth our <lb/>
            intellect, in which there is both knowledge and intelligence, <lb/>
            comprehends both good and evil; but good is akin to the <lb/>
            number seven, and evil is the brother of duality.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the law of wisdom, which abounds in beauty, says <lb/>
            expressly and carefully, that seed is to be nourished, not in <lb/>
            one place only, but in all the earth, both naturally, in the first <lb/>
            instance, and also morally, in its peculiar sense; because it is <lb/>
            very natural, and suitable to the character of God, to cause <lb/>
            that which in all parts and divisions of the world is said again <lb/>
            to be the seed of living beings, to fill places which have been <lb/>
            evacuated a second time with similar creatures, by a repeated <lb/>
            generation; and not altogether to desert our body, inasmuch <lb/>
            as it is an earthly substance, as if it were a thing deserted by <lb/>
            and void of all principle of life.</p>
          <p>Since, if we practise the drinking of wines and the eating of <lb/>
            meats, and indulge in the ardent desire of the female, and in <lb/>
            short practise in all things a delicate and luxurious life, we are <lb/>
            then only the bearers of a corpse in the body; but if God, <lb/>
            taking compassion on us, turns away the overflow of vices and <lb/>
            renders the soul dry, he will then begin to make the body <lb/>
            living, and to animate it with a purer soul, the governing <lb/>
            principle of which is wisdom.</p>
          <p>Why, after the entrance of Noah into the ark, did seven days <lb/>
            elapse, after which the deluge came?"*</p>
          <p>13. The kind Saviour of the world allows a space for the <lb/>
            repentance of sinners, in order that when they see the ark <lb/>
            placed in front of them as a sort of type, made with respect to <lb/>
            the then present time, and when they see all the different <lb/>
            kinds of living creatures shut up in it which the earth used to <lb/>
            bear on its surface, according to its parts adapted to the <lb/>
            different species, they might believe the predictions of the <lb/>
            deluge which had been made to them, so that, fearing total <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            destruction above all things, they might be speedily converted, <lb/>
            destroying and eradicating all their iniquity and wickedness.</p>
          <p>In the second place, thislanguage is a most manifest repre­ <lb/>
            sentation of the exceeding great abundance of the kind mercy <lb/>
            of the beneficent Saviour, by destroying the wickedness of <lb/>
            many years, which from the time of their birth to old age has <lb/>
            extended itself over their conduct in those persons who practise <lb/>
            penitence for a few days, for the divine nature forgets all evil <lb/>
            and is a lover of virtue. When therefore it beholds faithful <lb/>
            virtue in the soul, it gives it honour in a wonderful degree, in <lb/>
            order, in the first place, to take away all kinds of evil which <lb/>
            impend over it from its sins.</p>
          <p>In the third place, the number of seven days after the <lb/>
            entrance of Noah into the ark, during which the command of <lb/>
            God kept off the flood, is a recollection of the creation of the <lb/>
            world, the birthday festival of which is kept on the seventh <lb/>
            day, showing manifestly the authority of the Father; just as <lb/>
            if he were to say, " I am the Creator of the world, commanding <lb/>
            things to exist which have no existence; and at the same time <lb/>
            I am he who am now about to destroy the world with a great <lb/>
            flood. But the original cause of the creation of the world was <lb/>
            the goodness which is in me, and my kindness; and the cause <lb/>
            of its impending destruction is the ingratitude and impiety of <lb/>
            those persons who have been loaded by benefits by me."</p>
          <p>Therefore he causes an interval of seven days, in order that <lb/>
            the unbelieving may remember, and that those who have <lb/>
            abandoned their faith in the Parent of the world may in a <lb/>
            suppliant spirit return to the Creator of all things, and so may <lb/>
            entreat him again that his works may be everlasting; and that <lb/>
            they may offer their entreaty, not with mouth and tongue, but <lb/>
            rather with the heart of amendment and penitence.</p>
          <p>Why did the rain of the deluge last forty days and an equal <lb/>
            number of nights?*</p>
          <p>14. In the first place, the word day is used in a double <lb/>
            sense. The one meaning that time which is from morning to <lb/>
            evening, that is to say, from the first rising of the sun in the <lb/>
            east to his sinking in the west. Therefore they who make <lb/>
            definitions, say, " That is day, as long as the sun shines on <lb/>
            the eoxth." <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 4. </note> <pb n="355"/>
            </p>
          <p>In another sense, the word day is used of the day and night <lb/>
            together. And in this sense we say that a month consists of <lb/>
            thirty days, combining together and computing the period of <lb/>
            night in the same calculation.</p>
          <p>These premises having been first laid down thus, I say that <lb/>
            the word now spoken of has not been incorrectly employed, <lb/>
            inasmuch as it implies forty days and forty nights; but is also <lb/>
            so used in order to suggest a double number determined for the <lb/>
            generation of mankind, namely, forty and eighty, as many <lb/>
            men skilled in medicine, and indeed also in physical science, <lb/>
            have suggested; but it is especially described in the sacred law, <lb/>
            which was to them also the first principle of natural science.</p>
          <p>Since therefore destruction was on the point of overwhelming <lb/>
            all men and women every where on account of the excessive <lb/>
            combination of iniquities and quarrels, the Judge of all con­ <lb/>
            sidered it becoming to allot an equal time to their destruction <lb/>
            to that which he had consumed in the original creation of <lb/>
            nature and to the work of giving life to the world; for the <lb/>
            principle of procreation is the perseverance of seed in the <lb/>
            different parts; but it was necessary to honour the male creature <lb/>
            with pure light, which knows not the shade; but the woman <lb/>
            bad a mixture in her body of night and darkness.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in the creation of the whole world, the excess of <lb/>
            the male or the unequal number, being composed of unity, <lb/>
            becomes the parent of square numbers; but the woman who is <lb/>
            an unequal number, being compounded of duality, becomes the <lb/>
            parent of other long numbers. Moreover, the square is <lb/>
            splendour and light combining together by the equality of the <lb/>
            sides; but the other numbers being long necessarily exhibit <lb/>
            night and darkness by reason of their inequality, since that <lb/>
            which is in excess throws a shade over that which lies beneath <lb/>
            the excess.</p>
          <p>In the second place, the number forty is the produce of <lb/>
            many virtues, as has been suggested in another place. It is <lb/>
            also often used for the judgment of legislation, both with <lb/>
            reference to those persons who have done any thing rightly <lb/>
            deserving of praise and honour, and also with reference to <lb/>
            those who on account of their sins meet with reproaches and <lb/>
            punishments; so that it is superfluous to adduce proofs to <lb/>
            demonstrate what is evident.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " I will destroy <note type="footnote"> A A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            every living substance that I have made from off the face of <lb/>
            the earth?"*</p>
          <p>15. Do you not all shrink back in astonishment when you <lb/>
            hear these words, by reason of the beauty of the sentence ? for <lb/>
            he has not said, " destroy from the earth," but " from the face <lb/>
            of the earth," that is to say from its surface; in order, that is, <lb/>
            that in the lowest depth of the earth the vital efficacy of all <lb/>
            seeds might be preserved unhurt, and free from all injury <lb/>
            which could possibly bring damage to it; since the Creator <lb/>
            was not forgetful of his original design, but destroys those <lb/>
            only who come in his way, and who move only on the surface <lb/>
            of the earth, but leaves the roots in the depth, in order to <lb/>
            produce the generation of other causes.</p>
          <p>Moreover, that expression, ‟ I will destroy," was also <lb/>
            written by divine inspiration; for it happens that if we <lb/>
            remove the letters which require to be removed, the whole <lb/>
            table for the reception of letters remains the same. By which <lb/>
            he proves that he will destroy the fickle generation on account <lb/>
            of their impiety, but the conversation and essence of the <lb/>
            human race he will preserve for ever and ever to be the seed of <lb/>
            future generations. And what follows agrees with this, since <lb/>
            to the expression, "I will destroy," this other is also added, all <lb/>
            natural existence, every thing which exists, or rises upon the <lb/>
            earth; but existence is the destruction of the opposite cha­ <lb/>
            racteristics ; and that which is dissolved loses quality, but <lb/>
            retains body and materiality. This is the letter of what is <lb/>
            said.</p>
          <p>But in the inward meaning, the flood is symbolically repre­ <lb/>
            sentative of spiritual dissolution. When therefore by the <lb/>
            grace of the Father we desire to throw away and to wash off <lb/>
            all sensible and corporeal qualities by which the intellect was <lb/>
            infected as by swelling sores, then the muddy slime is got rid <lb/>
            of as by a deluge, sweet waters and wholesome fountains <lb/>
            supervening.</p>
          <p>Why does he say: " Noah did every thing which the Lord <lb/>
            commanded (or ordered) him ?</p>
          <p>16. A noble panegyric for the just man. In tne first place, <lb/>
            because with an ingenuous mind and a purpose full of affection <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis vii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            towards God he performed, not a part of what he had been <lb/>
            commanded, but the whole of God's commands. But the <lb/>
            second is the more true expression, because he does not choose <lb/>
            so much to command as to order him; for masters command <lb/>
            their slaves, but friends order friends, and especially elder <lb/>
            friends order younger ones. Therefore it is a marvellous gift <lb/>
            to be found even in the rank of servants, and in the list of <lb/>
            ministers of God; and it is a superabundant excess of kind­ <lb/>
            ness for any one to be a beloved friend to the most glorious <lb/>
            Uncreated Essence.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the sacred writer has here carefully employed <lb/>
            both names, the Lord God, as declaratory of his superior <lb/>
            powers of destroying and benefiting, using the word Lord <lb/>
            first, and placing the name God, giving the idea of bene­ <lb/>
            ficence, second; since it was a time of judgment let the <lb/>
            name which is the indication of his destroying power come <lb/>
            first. But still, as he is a kind and merciful king, he leaves <lb/>
            as relics the seminal elements by which the vacant places <lb/>
            may be replenished, for which reason, at the first beginning <lb/>
            of the account of the creation, the expression, " Let there be," <lb/>
            was not an exterminating act of power, but a beneficent one.</p>
          <p>Therefore, at the creation, he changed the appellations and <lb/>
            use of names; but as the name God is an indication of his <lb/>
            beneficent power, the sacred writer has more frequently em­ <lb/>
            ployed that in his account of the creation of the universe, <lb/>
            but after everything was perfected then he called him Lord, <lb/>
            in reference to the creation itself, for this name betokens <lb/>
            royal power and the ability to destroy; since, where the act <lb/>
            of generation is God is used first in order, but when punish­ <lb/>
            ment is spoken of the name Lord is placed before the name <lb/>
            God.</p>
          <p>Why did the deluge take place in the six hundredth year of <lb/>
            the life of Noah, and in the seventh month, and on the twenty- <lb/>
            seventh day of the month ? *</p>
          <p>17. Perhaps it happened that the just man was born at <lb/>
            the beginning of the month, at the first beginning of the <lb/>
            commencement of that very year which they are accustomed <lb/>
            to call the sacred year, out of honour, otherwise the sacred <lb/>
            historian would not have been so carefully accurate in fixing <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            the day and month when the deluge began to the seventh <lb/>
            month and the twenty-seventh day of the month.</p>
          <p>But, perhaps, by this minuteness he intended manifestly <lb/>
            to indicate the precise time of the vernal equinox, for that <lb/>
            always occurs on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month.</p>
          <p>But why was it that the deluge fell on the day of the vernal <lb/>
            equinox ? Because about that time the birth and increase <lb/>
            of everything take place, whether living creatures or plants; <lb/>
            therefore the vengeance and punishment inflicted brings with <lb/>
            it the more terrible and dreadful threats, as happening at the <lb/>
            period of plenty and fertility of the sheaves of corn, and <lb/>
            indeed, in the very midst of that productiveness, and bringing <lb/>
            the evil of utter destruction as a reproof of the impiety of <lb/>
            those who are exposed to the punishment.</p>
          <p>For behold, says he, all nature contains its own productions <lb/>
            within itself in the greatest abundance, namely, wheat and <lb/>
            barley, and everything else which is produced from seed, <lb/>
            brought on to complete generation, as, also, it begins to <lb/>
            generate the fruits of trees; but you, like mortals, corrupt <lb/>
            its mercies, perverting the divine gifts, and purposes, and <lb/>
            mysteries.</p>
          <p>But if the deluge had taken place at the autumnal equinox, <lb/>
            when there was nothing growing on the earth, but when all <lb/>
            the crops were collected into their proper storehouses, it would <lb/>
            not have, in any degree, been looked upon as a punishment, <lb/>
            but rather as a benefit, as the water would have cleansed the <lb/>
            plains and the mountains. But as the first man who was <lb/>
            produced out of the earth was also created at the same season <lb/>
            of the year, he whom the divine writer calls Adam, because <lb/>
            in fact it was on every account proper that the grandfather, <lb/>
            or original parent, or father of the human race, or by what­ <lb/>
            ever name we may choose to designate that original founder <lb/>
            of our kind, should be created at the season of the venial <lb/>
            equinox, when all earthly productions were full of their fruit; <lb/>
            but the vernal equinox takes place in the seventh month, <lb/>
            which is also called the first in other passages, with reference <lb/>
            to a different idea.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, the first beginning of the generation of our <lb/>
            race, after the destruction caused by the deluge, commenced <lb/>
            with Noah, men being again sown and procreated, therefore <lb/>
            lie also is recognised as resembling the first man born of the <lb/>

            earth, as far as such resemblance or recognition is possible. <lb/>
            And the six hundredth year has for its origin the number <lb/>
            six ; and the world was created under the number six, there­ <lb/>
            fore, by this same number does he reprove the wicked, putting <lb/>
            them to shame because he would, unquestionably, never, after <lb/>
            he had created the universe by means of the number six, have <lb/>
            destroyed all the men who lived on the earth under the form <lb/>
            of six, if it had not been for the preposterous excess of their <lb/>
            iniquities. For the third power of six and the minor power <lb/>
            is the number six hundred, and the mean between both is <lb/>
            sixty, since the number ten more evidently represents the <lb/>
            likeness of unity, and the number a hundred represents the <lb/>
            minor power.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And the fountains <lb/>
            of the deep were broken, and the springs of heaven were <lb/>
            opened ?"*</p>
          <p>18. The literal meaning is plain enough, for it suggests <lb/>
            the two extremities of the universe, the heaven and the earth, <lb/>
            to have met together for the destruction of mortals deserving <lb/>
            of condemnation, the waters running forth to meet one another <lb/>
            from all quarters, for part of them bubbled up from out of the <lb/>
            earth, and part descended downwards from heaven ; and in <lb/>
            truth, that expression is very explicit, " The fountains were <lb/>
            broken up," for when a rupture is effected then the thing <lb/>
            confined rushes forth without any hindrance.</p>
          <p>But with reference to the interior meaning of the expression <lb/>
            we may as well say this: the heaven is symbolically the hu­ <lb/>
            man intellect, and the earth is the sense and body, therefore <lb/>
            there is great distress and calamity when neither remains, but <lb/>
            when each threatens a secret attack. But what is the exact <lb/>
            meaning of my words ?</p>
          <p>It often happens that acuteness of intellect exhibits cunning <lb/>
            and wickedness, and bears itself with bitterness in every re­ <lb/>
            spect when the lusts of the body are restrained and bridled; <lb/>
            but the contrary fact often prevails, and the lusts rejoice in <lb/>
            their opportunities and proceed onward, gaining strength from <lb/>
            luxury and abundance of means ; therefore, the gate of these <lb/>
            lusts is the outward sense combined with the body; but when <lb/>
            the intellect, neglecting outward circumstances, is consistent <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            with itself, then the senses lie harmless, as if completely <lb/>
            abandoned; but when both are united, the intellect in exert­ <lb/>
            ing all cunning and wickedness, and the body irrigated with <lb/>
            all the senses and gorged with every kind of vice to satiety, <lb/>
            then we are exposed to a deluge ; and this is in fact a great <lb/>
            deluge, when the streams of the intellect are opened by <lb/>
            iniquity, and folly, and greedy desire, and injustice, and <lb/>
            arrogance, and impiety, and when the fountains of the body <lb/>
            are opened by lust, and desire, and intemperance, and obscenity, <lb/>
            and gluttony, and lasciviousness, with relations and sisters, and <lb/>
            all irremediable diseases.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, And the Lord shut <lb/>
            him in, closing the doors of the ark ? ”*</p>
          <p>19. Since we have said that the structure of the human <lb/>
            body is symbolically indicated by the ark, we must take notice. <lb/>
            also, that on the outside this body is enclosed by a hard and <lb/>
            dense skin, to be a covering to all its parts; for nature has <lb/>
            made this as a sort of coat, to prevent either cold or heat <lb/>
            from being able to do man injury.</p>
          <p>The literal meaning of the expression is plain enough, for <lb/>
            the door of the ark is carefully shut by divine virtue for the <lb/>
            sake of security, lest the water should enter in at any part, <lb/>
            as it was to be tossed about by the waves for an entire year.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And the water <lb/>
            was greatly increased, and bore up the ark which floated upon <lb/>
            the water? "t</p>
          <p>20. The literal meaning is plain enough, but it contains an <lb/>
            allegorical reference to our bodies, which ought to be borne <lb/>
            up as if on the water, and by fluctuating with our necessities <lb/>
            to subdue hunger and thirst, cold and heat, by which it is <lb/>
            agitated, disturbed, and kept in motion.</p>
          <p>Why did the water overflow fifteen cubits above all the <lb/>
            highest mountains ?‡</p>
          <p>21. With respect to the literal statement we must remark <lb/>
            that the excess was not merely one of fifteen cubits above all <lb/>
            high mountains but above those which were a great deal more <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 16. </note><note type="footnote">† Genesis vii. 17. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis vii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            lofty and high than some others ; therefore it was a great deal <lb/>
            more than that height above the lower ones.</p>
          <p>But we must interpret this statement allegorically; for the <lb/>
            loftier mountains shadow forth the senses in our body, because <lb/>
            it has been permitted to them to occupy the abode of stability <lb/>
            in the lofty region of our head. And there are five numbers <lb/>
            of these, each to be considered separately, so that they amount <lb/>
            in all to fifteen.</p>
          <p>As, there is the faculty of sight, the thing which is visible, <lb/>
            the act of seeing.</p>
          <p>The faculty of hearing, the thing which is audible, and the <lb/>
            act of hearing.</p>
          <p>The faculty of smelling, the thing which can be smelled, <lb/>
            and the act of smelling.</p>
          <p>The faculty of taste, the thing which can be tasted, and the <lb/>
            act of tasting.</p>
          <p>The faculty of touch, the thing which can be touched, and <lb/>
            the act of touching.</p>
          <p>These are the fifteen cubits in excess; for they also are <lb/>
            overwhelmed by the overflow, being destroyed by the un­ <lb/>
            seasonable influx of infinite vices and evils.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And all flesh <lb/>
            capable of motion perished ? ” *</p>
          <p>22. It is with especial propriety, and strictly in accordance <lb/>
            with natural truth, that the sacred historian has here pro­ <lb/>
            nounced all flesh capable of motion devoted to destruction ; <lb/>
            for flesh excites pleasures, and is excited by pleasures; and <lb/>
            such affections are the causes of the destruction of souls, as <lb/>
            on the other hand sobriety and patience are the causes of <lb/>
            safety.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " And everything <lb/>
            which was on the dry land died ? "t</p>
          <p>23. The literal meaning is notorious, because in that great <lb/>
            deluge everything which was upon the earth was destroyed <lb/>
            and perished; but with respect to the secret meaning, as, <lb/>
            since the material of timber, when it is parched and dry, is <lb/>
            readily consumed by fire, so, likewise, when the soul is not <lb/>
            mingled with wisdom, and justice, and piety, and the other <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 21. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis vii. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="362"/>
            enduring virtues, which alone are able to impart real joy to <lb/>
            the thoughts, then it, being parched up and dried like a plant <lb/>
            which is deprived of any power of budding or producing seed, <lb/>
            or like a withered trunk, dies, being handed over to the mercy <lb/>
            of the overwhelming overflow of the body.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, " It destroyed every <lb/>
            living substance which was on the face of the earth?"*</p>
          <p>24. The literal meaning of these words only announces a <lb/>
            plain statement of a fact, but it may be turned into an alle­ <lb/>
            gory in this manner. It is not without reason that the sacred <lb/>
            historian has used the words ‟ a living substance," for that <lb/>
            is characteristic of ambition and pride, which lead men to <lb/>
            despise both divine and human laws ; but ambition and arro­ <lb/>
            gance do rather appear on the face of our earthly and corporeal <lb/>
            nature with an elated countenance and contracted brows.</p>
          <p>Since there are some persons who come nearer to one with <lb/>
            their feet, but with their chests, and necks, and heads lean <lb/>
            back, and are actually borne backwards and bend away like <lb/>
            a balance, so that with one half of their body, in consequence <lb/>
            of the position of their feet, they project forward, but back­ <lb/>
            ward with the upper portion of their chests, drawing them­ <lb/>
            selves back like those persons whose muscles and nerves are in <lb/>
            pain, by which they are prevented from stooping in a natural <lb/>
            manner. But men of this kind it was determined to put an <lb/>
            end to, as one may see from the records of the Lord and the <lb/>
            divine history of the scriptures.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, ‟ Noah remained alone, <lb/>
            and they who were with him in the ark ?" t</p>
          <p>25. The literal meaning of this is evident; but with re­ <lb/>
            spect to its concealed sense we may advance an opinion, that <lb/>
            the intellect which is desirous of studying justice and wisdom <lb/>
            does, like a tree, discard all noxious shoots which bud forth <lb/>
            about it, and rejects all extravagant humours of superfluous <lb/>
            vigour, I mean immoderate excess of the affections, and <lb/>
            wickedness, and all the effects of such.</p>
          <p>Therefore he is here said to have been left alone with those <lb/>
            of his own kindred, and his kindred are properly all those <lb/>
            designs and thoughts of each individual, which are regulated <note type="footnote"> * Genssis vii. 23. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis vii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            in accordance with virtue, on which account the statement is <lb/>
            added " And he remained alone, and they who were with <lb/>
            him," in order to reveal a more genuine joy; but he remained <lb/>
            in the ark, that is to say, in the body, because it was purified <lb/>
            from every vice and spiritual disease, as the intellect was not <lb/>
            yet put in such a condition as to be wholly incorporeal.</p>
          <p>And on this account also, we must render thanks to the <lb/>
            merciful Father, because he received his consort and colleague <lb/>
            no longer as one endowed with superior power, but to be sub­ <lb/>
            ordinate to his own power, on which account also the body is <lb/>
            not submerged in the deluge, but rising above the flood is not <lb/>
            at all destroyed by the eddies of the cataracts, which a cra­ <lb/>
            pulous, libidinous, vanity-loving will, overflowing all things, <lb/>
            raises to an eminence.</p>
          <p>Why is it that the sacred writer says, " And God was <lb/>
            mindful of Noah, and of the beasts, and of the cattle," but <lb/>
            does not add that he remembered his wife and children ?*</p>
          <p>26. As the husband agrees with and is equal to his wife, <lb/>
            and as the father is equal to his sons, there is no need of men­ <lb/>
            tioning more names than one, but one, the first, is sufficient; <lb/>
            therefore, by naming Noah he, in effect, names all those who <lb/>
            were with him of his family; for when husband, and wife, <lb/>
            and children, and relations are all agitated by discord, then <lb/>
            it is no longer possible for such to be called one family, but <lb/>
            instead of being one they are many; but when harmony exists <lb/>
            then one family is exhibited by one superior of the house, and <lb/>
            all are seen to depend upon that one, like the branches of a <lb/>
            tree which shoot out from it, or the fruit upon a vine branch <lb/>
            which does not fall off from it.</p>
          <p>And in another part, also, the prophet has said, " Have a <lb/>
            regard to Abraham your father, and to Sarah who brought <lb/>
            you forth," where, because in fact it was one family, he displays <lb/>
            the agreement by mentioning the woman.</p>
          <p>Why is it that the sacred writer made mention first of the <lb/>
            beasts and afterwards of the cattle, saying that God re­ <lb/>
            membered Noah, and the beasts, and the cattle ?f</p>
          <p>27. In the first place, that poetical rule has not been <lb/>
            expressed in vain, that be led the bad into the middle; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 1. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            therefore he places the beasts in the middle, between the <lb/>
            domestic animals, that is to say the men and the cattle, in <lb/>
            order that they might be tamed and civilized by having an <lb/>
            intimate association with both.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he thought it scarcely reasonable to <lb/>
            bestow a provident benefit on the beasts by themselves, because <lb/>
            he was about immediately to add a statement of the beginning <lb/>
            of the diminution of the deluge. This is the explanation of <lb/>
            the statement taken literally.</p>
          <p>But with respect to the inner meaning, that just intellect, <lb/>
            dwelling in the body as if in the ark, possesses both beasts <lb/>
            and living animals, not those particular ones which bite and <lb/>
            hurt, but, that I may use such an expression, those general <lb/>
            kinds which contain in themselves the principles of seed and <lb/>
            origination ; since without these the soul cannot be manifest <lb/>
            in the body. Moreover, the soul of the foolish man employs <lb/>
            all poisonous and deadly animals, but that of the wise man <lb/>
            those only which have changed the nature of wild beasts into <lb/>
            that of domestic creatures.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, ‟He brought a <lb/>
            breath over the earth, and the water ceased ? "*</p>
          <p>28. Some people say that what is here meant by " a breath ” <lb/>
            is the wind, at which the deluge ceased. But I am not aware <lb/>
            that water is diminished by wind, but only that it is disturbed <lb/>
            and agitated into waves, for if it were otherwise the vast extent <lb/>
            of the sea would have been wholly dried up long ago.</p>
          <p>Therefore it appears to me that the sacred writer here means <lb/>
            the breath of the Deity, by which the whole universe obtains <lb/>
            security at the same time with the calamities of the world, <lb/>
            and with those things which exist in the air, and in every <lb/>
            mixture of plants and animals. Since the deluge of that <lb/>
            time was no trifling infliction of water, but an immense and <lb/>
            boundless overflow, extending almost beyond the pillars of <lb/>
            Hercules and the great Mediterranean Sea, since the whole <lb/>
            earth and all the spaces of the mountains were covered with <lb/>
            water; and it is scarcely likely that such a vast space could <lb/>
            have been cleared by a wind, but rather, as I have said, it <lb/>
            must have been done by some invisible and divine virtue. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 2. </note> <pb n="365"/>
            </p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " The fountains of <lb/>
            the deep were closed, and the cataracts of heaven ? "*</p>
          <p>29. In the first place, it is agreed upon by all that in the <lb/>
            first period of forty days the waters of punishment fell un­ <lb/>
            interruptedly, the lowest fountains of the earth being burst <lb/>
            asunder; and from above, the cataracts of heaven being <lb/>
            opened, and pouring down until all places, both level and <lb/>
            mountainous, were covered with the inundation; and for <lb/>
            another period of a hundred and fifty entire days the waters <lb/>
            did not cease to fall, nor did the streams cease to flow, nor <lb/>
            the springs to burst up, though still in milder quantities, not <lb/>
            so as to increase the existing flood, but only so as to secuie <lb/>
            the duration of the existence of the deluge, which was also <lb/>
            assisted from on high; and this is what is indicated in the <lb/>
            meantime by the statement that after a hundred and fifty <lb/>
            days the fountains and the cataracts were closed up ; therefore, <lb/>
            while as yet they were not closed up it is plain that they <lb/>
            were in action.</p>
          <p>In the second place, it was necessary that that which afforded <lb/>
            the excessive supply of waters for the deluge, namely, the <lb/>
            double reservoir of water, the one from the fountains of the <lb/>
            earth, and the other from the pourings forth of heaven, should <lb/>
            be both closed, for the more the stores from which any material <lb/>
            is supplied fail, the more it is consumed by itself, especially <lb/>
            when divine virtue has given the command.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of the expression. But with <lb/>
            respect to the inner sense of the passage, since the deluge <lb/>
            of the mind arises from two things, for it arises partly from <lb/>
            counsel, as if from heaven, and in another degree also from <lb/>
            the body and from sense, as if from earth, the vices being <lb/>
            reciprocally introduced by the passions and the passions by <lb/>
            the vices, it was inevitably necessary that the word of the <lb/>
            divine physician entering in as a salutary visitation for the <lb/>
            purpose of healing the disease, should prevent both kinds of <lb/>
            overflow for the future ; for it is the first principle of the <lb/>
            medical art to drive away the cause of the infirmity and to <lb/>
            leave no longer any materials for disease ; and the scripture <lb/>
            teaches this, also, in the case of the leper, for when the <lb/>
            leprosy is checked and is prevented from extending further, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="366"/>
            it then fixes the station and abode of the leprous man in the <lb/>
            same place by a law, because the character of being stationary <lb/>
            implies cleanliness, for that which is moved contrary to nature <lb/>
            is unclean.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement that after a hundred <lb/>
            and fifty days the water began to abate ? *</p>
          <p>30. We must here inquire whether those hundred and <lb/>
            fifty days, during which the water was abating, are to be <lb/>
            distinguished from the four months, or whether they have a <lb/>
            reference to the days previously mentioned, during which the <lb/>
            deluge went on unceasingly, as still increasing.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, " The ark settled in the seventh month <lb/>
            on the seven and twentieth day of the month ? "t</p>
          <p>31. It is reasonable here to consider how the beginning of <lb/>
            the deluge commences in the seventh month, on the twenty- <lb/>
            seventh day of the month, and how the diminution, when the <lb/>
            ark rested on the top of the mountains, again took place in <lb/>
            the seventh month and on the twenty-seventh day of the <lb/>
            month ; therefore we must say, that there is here an ho­ <lb/>
            monymy of months and days, for the beginning of the flood <lb/>
            took place in the seventh month, beginning at the birthday <lb/>
            of the just man, near the time of the vernal equinox, and <lb/>
            its diminution took place in the seventh month, beginning <lb/>
            from the highest point of the flood at the autumnal equinox, <lb/>
            since the two equinoxes are separated from one another by <lb/>
            seven months, having an interval of five months between them.</p>
          <p>For the seventh month of the equinox is also by its virtue <lb/>
            the first month, because the creation of the world took place <lb/>
            in it, on account of the abundance of all things at that season. <lb/>
            And, in like manner, the seventh month of the autumnal <lb/>
            equinox, which, according to time, is the first in dignity, having <lb/>
            its principle of that number seven derived from the air; <lb/>
            therefore. the deluge took place in the seventh month, not <lb/>
            according to time but according to nature, having for its <lb/>
            principle and commencement the spring season.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, " In the tenth month, on the first day of <lb/>
            the month, the heads of the mountains appeared ? ”‡ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 3. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis vir. 4. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Ibid. </note> <pb n="367"/>
            </p>
          <p>32. As in numerals the number ten is the extreme bound <lb/>
            of the units, being a definitive and perfect number, so too <lb/>
            it is the cycle and end of the units, and also the beginning and <lb/>
            cycle of the decades, and of infinity of numbers; thus the <lb/>
            Creator, on the cessation of the deluge, condescended that the <lb/>
            tops of the mountains should appear in the number of the <lb/>
            decade, being a definitive and perfect number.</p>
          <p>Why was it after forty days that the just man opened the <lb/>
            window of the ark ? *</p>
          <p>33. We must observe carefully that the divine historian <lb/>
            uses the same number in speaking of the influx of the deluge <lb/>
            and in mentioning the cessation and complete removal of the <lb/>
            evil; forsooth on the twenty-seventh day of the seventh month <lb/>
            in the six hundredth year of the life of Noah, that is to say in <lb/>
            the six hundredth year after his nativity, the deluge began at <lb/>
            the spring season; but on the twenty-seventh day of the <lb/>
            seventh month, the ark rested on the top of the mountains at <lb/>
            the vernal equinox.</p>
          <p>But it is plain from these circumstances that the deluge <lb/>
            became invisible in the six hundred and first year of Noah's <lb/>
            life, again on the seventh month and the twenty-seventh day <lb/>
            of it, so that after the lapse of an entire year, it again settled <lb/>
            and established the earth as it was at the moment of its de­ <lb/>
            struction, in the spring season, budding forth and covered with <lb/>
            verdure and full of all kinds of fruits.</p>
          <p>But again in a similar manner the overflow of the deluge <lb/>
            took place for forty days, the cataracts of heaven being opened <lb/>
            and fountains bursting upwards from the lowest depths of the <lb/>
            earth; and again a hope of renewal took place at intervals of <lb/>
            forty days after a sufficient cessation of the rains, when be <lb/>
            opened the window; and again the duration of the permanent <lb/>
            deluge lasted for a period of a hundred and fifty days, as also <lb/>
            its gradual diminution occupied a period of a hundred and <lb/>
            fifty days; so that we may well admire the equality of the <lb/>
            arrangement, for the evil increased and ceased according to the <lb/>
            same number, like the moon, which from its first rise proceeds <lb/>
            in its increase according to an equal number, going onward to <lb/>
            its perfect fulness of light, and then again with an equal num­ <lb/>
            ber in its decrease, returning back to its original state, after <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            having been previously full; and in like manner in the case of <lb/>
            divine chastisements, the Creator preserves a regular order, <lb/>
            banishing all irregularity from the divine borders.</p>
          <p>What is the window of the ark, which the just man opens?*</p>
          <p>34. The literal statement scarcely admits of any difficulty or <lb/>
            doubt, inasmuch as it is plain; but with reference to the inner <lb/>
            meaning we have this to say : each separate part of the senses <lb/>
            has imitated the windows of the body, since it is through them <lb/>
            as through windows that the comprehension of sensible objects <lb/>
            enters into the intellect, and again it is through them that the <lb/>
            intellect stretches forth as if escaping; but a portion of these <lb/>
            windows, the senses, the more noble portion too, I say, is the <lb/>
            sight; inasmuch as that above all the rest is akin to the soul, <lb/>
            and it is intimately acquainted with light, the, most beautiful <lb/>
            of the essences, and it is the minister of sacred things; more­ <lb/>
            over that is the one which first laid open the road to philo­ <lb/>
            sophy.</p>
          <p>For beholding the regular motion of the sun, and of the <lb/>
            moon, and the erratic course of the other planets, and the uner­ <lb/>
            ring circular motion of the whole heaven, and the order and <lb/>
            harmony there existing beyond all calculation, as if it were <lb/>
            the one real creator of the whole world, it by itself related to <lb/>
            its one chief counsellor and director all that it saw: and then <lb/>
            intellect, seeing those things with its acute eye, and by those <lb/>
            things discerning superior demonstrative ideas, and the cause <lb/>
            of all those things, immediately perceived that there was a <lb/>
            God at the same moment that it arrived at the conception of <lb/>
            generation and providence, because forsooth it was plain that <lb/>
            this visible nature was not created by itself: for it was impos­ <lb/>
            sible that such a harmony, and order, and reason, and most <lb/>
            consistent analogy, and that a concord of such a character and <lb/>
            extent, and that such true and perfect felicity should exist by <lb/>
            its own power: but it was necessary that there must be some <lb/>
            Creator and parent of it acting like a governor and director, <lb/>
            who generated these things, and then having generated them <lb/>
            preserves them safe and sound.</p>
          <p>Why did he send out a raven first ? f</p>
          <p>35. If we look to the literal statement, the raven is said to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 6. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            be an animal particularly set apart for being sent on messages <lb/>
            and employed in offices; for to this very day many people <lb/>
            watch its mode of flight and its chattering, judging that it <lb/>
            gives some intimation of unknown facts ; but with respect to <lb/>
            the hidden meaning, as a raven is a black, and arrogant, and <lb/>
            speedy animal, it is a sign of wickedness, which brings night <lb/>
            and darkness over the soul, and it is also swift to meet all the <lb/>
            things of the world in its flight.</p>
          <p>And also that it is very bold, so as at times to cause the <lb/>
            destruction of those who seek to catch it, since pride produces <lb/>
            also rash impudence, the opposite of which is virtue, which is <lb/>
            consistent with the brilliancy of light, and is by nature deco­ <lb/>
            rated with a modest bashfulness; therefore it is quite natural <lb/>
            that if there was any darkness remaining behind in the intel­ <lb/>
            lect, darkness which exists in accordance with folly, he should <lb/>
            expel that and send it out beyond his borders.</p>
          <p>Why did the raven after it had gone forth not return, when <lb/>
            there was not yet any part of the earth dried ?*</p>
          <p>36. This passage admits of an allegorical interpretation <lb/>
            since injustice is contrary to the light of justice; so that in <lb/>
            comparison of the admirable actions of the man endued with <lb/>
            virtue, it thinks it more desirable to rejoice with its kinsman <lb/>
            the deluge; for injustice is a lover of confusion and corruption.</p>
          <p>Why does he speak here in an incorrect manner, “ Till the <lb/>
            water was dried up from the earth;” when it was not the <lb/>
            water which was dried up from the earth, but the earth which <lb/>
            was dried from the water ? t</p>
          <p>37. He uses this expression in an allegorical sense, indicat­ <lb/>
            ing by the fall of the waters the immensity of vices, by which <lb/>
            when saturated and vigorous the soul is corrupted, but when <lb/>
            they are dried up and withered, it is preserved; for then they <lb/>
            cannot inflict any mischief upon it, since they are become <lb/>
            impotent and dead.</p>
          <p>Why does he in the second place fend forth the dove, and <lb/>
            why does he send it forth from himself to see whether the <lb/>
            water had ceased, when he uses no such expressions about the <lb/>
            raven ? ‡ <note type="footnote"> Genesis viii. 7. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note><note type="footnote">* Genesis viii. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B </note> <pb n="370"/>
            </p>
          <p>In the first place, the dove is a clean animal, and in the <lb/>
            second place it is tame, civilised, and one which associates <lb/>
            with mankind, on which account also the honour has been <lb/>
            allotted to it of being offered up upon the altar in sacrifices; <lb/>
            and on this account the sacred writer, sanctioning this honour <lb/>
            and adding the weight of his assertion, has said, he sent it <lb/>
            forth from himself, declaring by this expression that it dwelt <lb/>
            with him; and again, by the expression that it was to see <lb/>
            whether the water was abated, he displays the common anxiety <lb/>
            felt by both.</p>
          <p>But those birds, the raven and the dove, are symbols of <lb/>
            wickedness and virtue: for the one, whether it is wickedness <lb/>
            or the raven, has no house, nor habitation, nor city, being an <lb/>
            insolent unsociable bird ; but the other, namely virtue, has a <lb/>
            regard to humanity, and to the public good: and so the man <lb/>
            endowed with virtue sends that bird forth as his ambassador <lb/>
            for desirable and salutary objects, wishing to receive from it <lb/>
            desirable information ; and she, like an ambassador, brings us <lb/>
            back genuine pleasure, so that what is hurtful may be <lb/>
            guarded against, and what is useful may be diligently and <lb/>
            carefully admitted.</p>
          <p>Why did the dove, when it found no rest for its feet, return <lb/>
            to Noah?*</p>
          <p>39. Is not the reason of this evident, and is it not a plain <lb/>
            proof that wickedness and virtue are symbolically indicated by <lb/>
            the raven and the dove ? For behold the dove, which is the <lb/>
            last sent out, finds no rest. How, then, could the raven, who <lb/>
            departed previously, while the calamity of the deluge was still <lb/>
            prevailing, find any place, and make a settlement ? For the <lb/>
            raven was neither a swan nor an ibis, nor did he belong to the <lb/>
            class of aquatic birds.</p>
          <p>But the sacred writer here points out in an enigmatical <lb/>
            manner, that wickedness, when it has gone forth out of doors, <lb/>
            to the swelling whirlpools of the vices and passions which <lb/>
            overflow and corrupt the soul and life, joyfully admits them, <lb/>
            and dwells with and takes up its abode with them, as with its <lb/>
            nearest friends and relations; but virtue, turning away with <lb/>
            loathing from even the first sight of them, at once springs <lb/>
            back, and does not return, scarcely finding rest for its feet; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="371"/>
            finding, in fact, no standing ground anywhere, and no place <lb/>
            worthy of itself. For what other greater evil can there be <lb/>
            than this, that virtue should not be able to find in the soul <lb/>
            any place ever so small for rest and for abiding in ?</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " Putting forth his <lb/>
            hand, he received her, and brought her in to himself ?" *</p>
          <p>40. The literal meaning is plain, but with respect to the <lb/>
            hidden sense we must elicit the truth carefully. The wise <lb/>
            man employs truth as an overseer of and ambassador in im­ <lb/>
            portant affairs, which, when it perceives that those natures are <lb/>
            worthy of it, abides among and dwells with them, correcting <lb/>
            them, and making them better, since wisdom is a very common, <lb/>
            and equal, and useful thing. But when, with reference to the <lb/>
            opposite natures, it sees that in some points they are prepos­ <lb/>
            terously redundant and in others altogether deficient, it returns <lb/>
            to its proper place; and the man endowed with virtue admits <lb/>
            it in word, putting forth his hand to take it, and in fact <lb/>
            opening all his intellect for its reception, and unfolding it by <lb/>
            the perfect number, full and equal, with all imaginable prompti­ <lb/>
            tude.</p>
          <p>Nor even then, when he had sent her forth from himself to <lb/>
            examine the natures of other things, had he separated it from <lb/>
            himself, but had only acted like the sun, which sends forth his <lb/>
            beams to give light to all things, because it is not at all con­ <lb/>
            sistent with the character of his boundless light to be separated <lb/>
            at all.</p>
          <p>Why did he, after waiting yet seven other days, send forth <lb/>
            the dove a second time ?f</p>
          <p>41. This is an excellent example for life, since although it <lb/>
            will behold natures obstinate at first, still the hope of changing <lb/>
            them into better natures is scarcely allowed to drop ; and as a <lb/>
            prudent physician does not in a moment apply a perfect cure to <lb/>
            a disease, or effect a complete restoration to health, but employs <lb/>
            salutary medicines after he has given nature an opportunity of <lb/>
            first opening the way to recovery, so too the man endowed with <lb/>
            virtue behaves with respect to the employment of the word <lb/>
            which is in accordance with the law of wisdom.</p>
          <p>But the number seven is the sacred and dominical number, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 9. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis viii. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="372"/>
            according to which the Father of the universe, when he made <lb/>
            the world, is said to have looked upon his work. And the <lb/>
            contemplation of the world, and of all the things contained in <lb/>
            it, is nothing else but philosophy, and that excellent and select <lb/>
            portion of it which wisdom contains, comprehending within <lb/>
            itself also a work still more necessary to be seen.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " The dove returned <lb/>
            a second time to him about evening, having in her mouth a <lb/>
            leaf and a thin branch of olive ?"*</p>
          <p>42. All these separate points are selected and approved <lb/>
            signs-the returning, the returning about evening, the having <lb/>
            an olive-leaf and a thin branch of that tree, and oil, and the <lb/>
            having it in her mouth; but yet every one of these signs can <lb/>
            be examined with a certainty beyond certainty, for the return <lb/>
            is distinct from its previous return, for that one bore with it an <lb/>
            announcement of nature being wholly corrupted and rebellious, <lb/>
            and being wholly destroyed by the deluge, that is to say, by <lb/>
            great ignorance and insolence; but this second return brings <lb/>
            the news of the world beginning to repent, but to find repent­ <lb/>
            ance is not an easy task, but is a difficult and laborious <lb/>
            business.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that the dove arrived in the <lb/>
            evening, having passed the whole day from morning to evening <lb/>
            in its visitations; in word, indeed, examining places, but in <lb/>
            fact investigating the different parts of nature itself by con­ <lb/>
            tinual visitation, and seeing them all clearly from beginning to <lb/>
            end, for the evening is the indication of the end.</p>
          <p>The third sign, again, is its bringing a leaf; but a leaf is a <lb/>
            small part of a tree, still it does not exist without a tree. And <lb/>
            the beginning of displaying repentance is somewhat corre­ <lb/>
            spending to this, since the beginning of correction has some <lb/>
            slight indications about it, which we may call a leaf, by which <lb/>
            it appears to receive guardianship, but can easily be shaken <lb/>
            off; so that the hope shall in that case not be great of attain­ <lb/>
            ing the desired improvement, which is typified by the leaf of <lb/>
            no other tree but of the olive alone, and oil is the material of <lb/>
            light. For wickedness, as I have said before, is profound <lb/>
            darkness, but virtue is luminous brilliancy, and repentance is <lb/>
            the beginning of light. But you must not yet suppose that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            the beginning of repentance is only visible in branches just <lb/>
            germinating and beginning to look green, but that it exists too <lb/>
            while they are still dry, and while the seminal principle is dry <lb/>
            and quiescent.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that the fifth sign is shown, that, <lb/>
            namely, of the dove when it comes bearing a slender branch.</p>
          <p>And the sixth sign is that this slender branch was in its <lb/>
            mouth, for the number six is the first perfect number, since <lb/>
            virtue bears in its mouth, that is to say in its conversation, the <lb/>
            seeds of wisdom and justice, or, in one word, of honesty of the <lb/>
            soul; and not only bears this, but gives some portion of parti­ <lb/>
            cipation in it even to the foolish, by drawing up water for their <lb/>
            souls, and irrigating them with the desire of repentance for <lb/>
            their sins.</p>
          <p>Why is it said, " And Noah knew that the waters had <lb/>
            ceased from off the earth?"*</p>
          <p>43. The literal statement is plain, since if the leaf had been <lb/>
            taken up from off the water it would have been wet and soaked, <lb/>
            but now he says that it was dry and slender, as if it had <lb/>
            become dry by being on the earth which was dried. But with <lb/>
            reference to its inward meaning, the wise man takes it as a <lb/>
            symbol of repentance, and wishes to check the calamities of <lb/>
            excessive obstinacy by taking the leaf, since it was not yet green, <lb/>
            but slender, for the reason which has been already mentioned.</p>
          <p>At the same time we may admire the Father on account of <lb/>
            his exceeding kindness, for although corruption had prevailed <lb/>
            over all the men who lived on the earth from the excess of <lb/>
            their iniquities, still there remained some relics of antiquity <lb/>
            and of that which was from the beginning, and a slight seed of <lb/>
            previous virtues; by which it is intimated nevertheless that <lb/>
            the memory of all the good deeds that have been done from <lb/>
            the beginning is not wholly destroyed. On which account a <lb/>
            certain prophet, the kinsman and friend of Moses, uttered an <lb/>
            oracle of this kind, " If the omnipotent Lord had not left us a <lb/>
            seed, we should have been like blind and barren people," f able <lb/>
            neither to know the truth nor to generate it. And the Chal. <lb/>
            dæans in their native language call blindness and sterility <lb/>
            Sodom and Gomorrah. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii 11. </note><note type="footnote">t Isaiah i. 9. </note> <pb n="374"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why, in the third place, after seven other days, did he again <lb/>
            send forth the dove, which did not again return to him ?</p>
          <p>44. According to the word, the dove made no more return <lb/>
            to him; but what in fact is meant is virtue, which, however, <lb/>
            is not an indication of alienation, since, as I have said before, <lb/>
            she was not separated from him at that time, but sent forth <lb/>
            like a sun-beam to pay a visit of examination to the natures of <lb/>
            others, but then, not finding any one to listen to her precepts <lb/>
            of correction, she returns, and properly comes to him alone. <lb/>
            But this time she is no longer the possession of one single <lb/>
            individual, but is rather a common good to all those who have <lb/>
            been willing to receive the emanations of wisdom as if coming <lb/>
            up from the earth, those persons, that is, who from the very <lb/>
            beginning have laboured under a great thirst of perfect wisdom.</p>
          <p>Why in the six hundred and first year of the life of Noah, <lb/>
            and on the first day of the first month, did the waters of the <lb/>
            deluge cease from off the earth ? *</p>
          <p>45. The word first, according to the defect of time, is spoken <lb/>
            of with reference either to the month or the man, and each <lb/>
            interpretation has reason to support it; for if we are bound to <lb/>
            maintain that the water began to abate in the first mouth, we <lb/>
            are equally obliged to consider that the sacred historian in­ <lb/>
            tended also to speak of the seventh month, that is, of that <lb/>
            month which is the second equinox, since the same month is <lb/>
            both the first and the seventh; that is to say, the first as <lb/>
            respects nature and virtue, and the seventh in point of time.</p>
          <p>Therefore in another place he says,t " This month is unto <lb/>
            you the beginning of months, the first among the months of <lb/>
            the year;” calling that the first which is so in respect of <lb/>
            nature and virtue, and which as to number is in time the <lb/>
            seventh month, since the equinox has its appointed order in <lb/>
            regular series, and in point of time is assigned the better <lb/>
            season of the year. But if you take that word first to have <lb/>
            reference to the man, then it will be used with more truth, <lb/>
            and with strict propriety, for the just man was truly and <lb/>
            properly the first, as in a vessel the captain is the first man, <lb/>
            and in a state the prince. But he is first not only in virtue, <lb/>
            but also in order, inasmuch as in the very circumstances of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 13. </note><note type="footnote">+ Exodus xii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            regeneration of the second sowing of the human race he was <lb/>
            the beginning and the first.</p>
          <p>Moreover, it is very admirably considered with reference to <lb/>
            this passage, that the deluge took place during the life of the <lb/>
            first man, and that again, when it abated, things returned to <lb/>
            their former steadiness, since after the deluge took place he <lb/>
            had to live by himself with his whole family, and after that <lb/>
            evil was removed he alone was found upon the earth during <lb/>
            the latter period of his life until the regeneration of mankind <lb/>
            began.</p>
          <p>But it is not to no purpose that this testimony is given both <lb/>
            of the preceding portion of his life, and also of the later <lb/>
            period, for he alone burnt with a desire for that genuine life <lb/>
            which is in accordance with virtue, while all the rest of the <lb/>
            world were hastening on to death by reason of their fatal <lb/>
            wickednesses. Therefore of necessity the evil ceased on the <lb/>
            six hundred and first year of his life, since in truth the <lb/>
            destruction came with reference to the sixth number, and <lb/>
            safety was restored in unity, since unity is more a generative­ <lb/>
            ness of the soul, and is the best for giving life, wherefore also <lb/>
            a deficiency of water in the sea takes place at the new moon, <lb/>
            in order that the units may be preferred in dignity both among <lb/>
            months and years, when God saves those things which are <lb/>
            upon the earth ; since the man who cultivates just habits is <lb/>
            called by the Hebrews in their native language Noah, but by <lb/>
            the Greeks he is named <foreign xml:lang="grc">Δί</foreign>х<foreign xml:lang="grc">αιος</foreign> ; however, he is not exempted <lb/>
            from the laws affecting the body.</p>
          <p>For although he is not subordinate to the power of others, <lb/>
            but is a prince, yet still, because he is nevertheless devoted to <lb/>
            death, as he is dead, the principle of that number six is <lb/>
            connected with unity ; since it was not in one year taken <lb/>
            separately that the deluge ceased, but together with the <lb/>
            number six (as contained in the number six hundred), which <lb/>
            is connected with it according to corporeality and inequality; <lb/>
            since the other being a long number is in the first place six <lb/>
            (that is to say, six hundred) ; on which account it is said, in <lb/>
            the six hundred and first year. But the just man is so in his <lb/>
            generation, not in that which is general, nor again in that <lb/>
            in which he is just by comparison with the general corruption, <lb/>
            but according to some especial generation ; for his generation <lb/>
            bears with it a certain comparison. But that man also is <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            deserving of praise whom God selected beyond all other gene­ <lb/>
            rations as being considered worthy of life, placing a limit to <lb/>
            that life, and to him as being about to be both the end and the <lb/>
            beginning of each generation and of each age; the end of that <lb/>
            which is corruptible, the beginning of that which is to follow.</p>
          <p>And truly it is much more proper to praise him who, <lb/>
            bending upwards with his whole body, looked up by reason of <lb/>
            his friendship with God.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, "And Noah <lb/>
            opened the roof of the ark ?”*</p>
          <p>46. The text stands in need of no explanation. But with <lb/>
            reference to its meaning, because the ark is symbolically our <lb/>
            body, we must consider that that is spoken of as the roof of <lb/>
            our body, which covers it and for a long time preserves its <lb/>
            strength; such is concupiscence, by which the body is pre­ <lb/>
            served and made to last, in a moderate degree, that is, and in <lb/>
            accordance with the law of nature; as also it is dissolved by <lb/>
            pain.</p>
          <p>When therefore the intellect is attracted by a desire for <lb/>
            heavenly things it wishes to spring upwards, and in that way <lb/>
            it bursts asunder every appearance of concupiscence ; so that <lb/>
            that thing being as it were removed which threw a veil of <lb/>
            shade over it and obscured it, it might be able to apply its <lb/>
            senses to undisguised and incorporeal natures.</p>
          <p>Why is it that the earth was dried up in the seventh month, <lb/>
            and on the twenty-seventh day ?f</p>
          <p>47. Do you not see that he here calls that month the <lb/>
            seventh, which a little while before he styles the first? for the <lb/>
            seventh, as far as relates to time, is the same, as I have said <lb/>
            before, as that which is the first in nature, being the beginning <lb/>
            of the equinox. But it is with great propriety that the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the deluge is fixed to the seventh month, and the <lb/>
            twenty-seventh day of the month; and again, the end and <lb/>
            cessation of the deluge is fixed to the same seventh month aDd <lb/>
            the same day; for, both the deluge and the removal of life <lb/>
            took place at the equinox; the principle of which we have <lb/>
            indicated a little time ago ; for the seventh month is found to <lb/>
            be synonymous with months and days of this time, and then <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 13. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis viii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            again, the twenty-seventh day occurs with the same meaning, <lb/>
            when the ark rested on the mountains.</p>
          <p>This is the month which by nature is the seventh, but in <lb/>
            point of time the first, which in fact is the month of the <lb/>
            equinox. Therefore, at the equinoxes a power of selection is <lb/>
            given for seven months and twenty-seven days; for the deluge <lb/>
            took place in the seventh month, on which the vernal equinox <lb/>
            takes place; so that it is in time the seventh, but in nature <lb/>
            the first.</p>
          <p>And the cessation of the deluge and the display of mercy <lb/>
            belong to the same measure, when the ark rested on the tops of <lb/>
            the mountains ; again in truth in the seventh month, but not <lb/>
            the same month, but in that in which the autumnal equinox <lb/>
            occurs; that is to say, the seventh by nature, but the first in <lb/>
            point of time.</p>
          <p>But the most perfect cure, the fact of the evil being wholly <lb/>
            dried up, is again fixed to the seventh month and the twenty- <lb/>
            seventh day of the vernal season; in order that both the <lb/>
            beginning and the end of the deluge might find its boundary <lb/>
            at the same season; and that the middle season when human <lb/>
            life is repaired, is fixed to the intermediate season.</p>
          <p>In the meantime that expression is more certainly to be <lb/>
            observed, namely, that the whole year, by a strict computation <lb/>
            of days, made the deluge equal to the exact time of the <lb/>
            remedy; for it began in the six hundredth year of Noah's age, <lb/>
            in the seventh month, and on the twenty-seventh day; so <lb/>
            that the whole space of the intermediate time completed a <lb/>
            perfect year, the beginning being placed at the vernal equinox, <lb/>
            and the flood also ending equally at the same epoch of the <lb/>
            vernal equinox. And in this manner, after all things on earth, <lb/>
            things full of fruit, had undergone destruction, as I have said <lb/>
            before, now that the persons who used the fruits were also <lb/>
            destroyed, the earth being wholly relieved of all evil was again <lb/>
            found full of seeds and fruit-bearing trees, according to the <lb/>
            production of spring; for he thought it reasonable that, as the <lb/>
            earth after it had suffered the deluge was in a similar con­ <lb/>
            dition when dried again to that in which it was before, so it <lb/>
            should now show itself, and pay the debt which it owed to <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>Nor ought any one to wonder that in one day the earth when <lb/>
            left to itself produced every thing by divine virtue, both seeds <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            and trees, all complete, entirely and suddenly, with perfect and <lb/>
            excellent herbs, and grain, and plants, and fruits ; since in the <lb/>
            creation of the world on one day of the six he finished and <lb/>
            brought to perfection the whole generation of plants. But the <lb/>
            present fruits were already perfect in themselves, and produced <lb/>
            all kinds of fruits in a manner suitable and corresponding to <lb/>
            the season of spring; for all things are possible to God, who <lb/>
            scarcely requires time to effect any thing.</p>
          <p>Why was it that after the earth was dried, Noah did not <lb/>
            depart out of the ark, before he had received a fresh command <lb/>
            from God, for God said to Noah: " Go forth, thou, and thy <lb/>
            wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives, together with all the <lb/>
            rest of the living creatures ?" *</p>
          <p>48. Justice is commonly inspired with fear, as on the other <lb/>
            hand injustice is rash and self-confident. But the proof of a <lb/>
            fear of God is the not giving up more to, or guiding one's self <lb/>
            more by one's own reason than by God. And above all other <lb/>
            men it was natural for that man who had seen the whole earth <lb/>
            suddenly become an immense sea, to suspect that it might be <lb/>
            possible that the same misfortune would again return.</p>
          <p>Besides this, he also gave a thought to the corresponding <lb/>
            consequence, namely, that as he had entered into the ark at <lb/>
            the command of God, so it was fitting that he should also <lb/>
            leave it at the command of the same being ; for let no one <lb/>
            believe that he can ever do any thing perfectly unless God <lb/>
            himself guides him by his preventing precepts.</p>
          <p>Why, when they entered into the ark was the order as fol­ <lb/>
            lows : first himself and his sons, and after them his wife and <lb/>
            his sons' wives, but when they went forth the order was <lb/>
            changed, for the sacred historian says, " Noah and his wife <lb/>
            went forth, and after them his sons and his sons' wives ?"t</p>
          <p>49. By the literal statement the sacred writer gives an <lb/>
            obscure intimation, in the order in which they entered, that the <lb/>
            propagation of seed was taken away, but by the order of their <lb/>
            egress he implies the continuance of the process of generation ; <lb/>
            since, while they are entering, the sons are mentioned together <lb/>
            with their father, and the daughters-in-law with their mother­ <lb/>
            in-law, but when they are going forth the wives are all mated <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 16. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis viii. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            again, the father being accompanied by his wife, and each of <lb/>
            his sons also by his wife, since he chose to show by fact <lb/>
            rather than by words everything which it is fitting for his <lb/>
            friends to do.</p>
          <p>Moreover he had in express words, and not by any vague <lb/>
            intimations, commanded the men, as they were about to enter <lb/>
            into the ark, that they while there were to keep themselves <lb/>
            from connection with women; but now that they were about <lb/>
            to depart from it, he plainly intimates to them that offspring <lb/>
            is to be begotten in accordance with nature, by the order in <lb/>
            which he appoints their going forth; nor did he employ words <lb/>
            only, in order to make his proclamation about the state of the <lb/>
            ark, saying, “ After a destruction of all things on earth, of such <lb/>
            a character and of such extent, do not indulge in pleasures, for <lb/>
            that is not decorous. It is sufficient, however, for you to have <lb/>
            received your lives; but while you are actually in the ark, to <lb/>
            ascend up into the marriage- bed with your wives would be a <lb/>
            proof of your being devoted to lasciviousness."</p>
          <p>And, indeed, it was natural for them, as being relations to <lb/>
            those who were being destroyed, to be moved with compassion <lb/>
            for the perishing human race, especially because they them­ <lb/>
            selves also were still in doubt whether, from some quarter or <lb/>
            other, calamity might not fall also upon themselves; and be­ <lb/>
            sides these considerations it was absurd, while those who were <lb/>
            alive were perishing, for those in the ark to be contriving that <lb/>
            others who did not exist should be born, being warm at an <lb/>
            unreasonable time, and burning with an inopportune desire. <lb/>
            But after the anger of God ceased, then he commanded those <lb/>
            who had been delivered from the calamity, when they had again <lb/>
            gone forth out of the ark in order, to apply themselves to the <lb/>
            procreation of a succeeding generation, when he tells us, that <lb/>
            the men did not go forth with the men, nor the women with <lb/>
            the women, but the wives with their husbands.</p>
          <p>But with respect to the inner meaning of this fact, we must <lb/>
            say this, that when the mind is about to wash off and cleanse <lb/>
            away its sins, then it is fit for male to live with male, that is <lb/>
            to say, for the intellect, the chief part of the man, to be as a <lb/>
            father, united to each separate thought, as a father to his sons, <lb/>
            without any admixture of the female race, which is in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with the outward sense; since it is a time of battle, in <lb/>
            which it is necessary to keep the order of the cohort distinct. <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            and to preserve it strictly in order, that the soldiers may not <lb/>
            be mingled in confusion, and so, instead of gaining a victory <lb/>
            over the enemy, be conquered themselves; but when the puri­ <lb/>
            fication is completed, and when the soul is dried up from all <lb/>
            ignorance, and when a complete deliverance from everything <lb/>
            pernicious has taken place, then it becomes the man to collect <lb/>
            his scattered forces together, not in order that masculine conn­ <lb/>
            sels may be rendered effeminate by softness, but that the <lb/>
            female race, that is to say, the outward senses, may clothe them­ <lb/>
            selves with the vigour of the male, attaining to masculine coun­ <lb/>
            sels, and from their receiving seed for the production of a <lb/>
            generation ; so that, from this time forth they may cherish, in <lb/>
            all things, sentiments of wisdom, and honour, and justice, and <lb/>
            courage, and, in one word, of virtue. But, besides this, it will <lb/>
            be reasonable also to take notice, that when once a confusion, <lb/>
            in the similitude of a deluge, has overwhelmed the intellect, <lb/>
            and when the different senses, being perplexed by the affairs <lb/>
            of this world, like so many bulwarks erected against them, <lb/>
            begin to quarrel, it is utterly impossible that any one should <lb/>
            be able, either to sow, or to conceive, or to generate any good <lb/>
            thing. But when all the hostile attacks of various agitations <lb/>
            and passions are checked, and when the ceaseless invasions of <lb/>
            lawless counsels are repressed, then the soul produces virtue <lb/>
            and excellent works, as the most fertile portion of the earth, <lb/>
            when dried, produces fruits.</p>
          <p>Why did Noah build an altar without having been com­ <lb/>
            manded to do so ?*</p>
          <p>5 0. The requital of gratitude which is due to God ought to <lb/>
            be offered to him without command, and without any delay or <lb/>
            hesitation, showing the mind to be free from vices ; for it be­ <lb/>
            comes that man, who has been endued with blessings by God, <lb/>
            to offer him his thanks with a grateful and willing mind; but <lb/>
            he who delays to do so, waiting for an express command, is <lb/>
            ungrateful, being as it were compelled by necessity to honour <lb/>
            his benefactor.</p>
          <p>Why is he said to have built an altar to God, and not to <lb/>
            the Lord ?t</p>
          <p>51. In passages of beneficence and regeneration, as at the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 20. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            creation of the world, the sacred writer only refers to the be­ <lb/>
            neficent virtue of the Creator, by which he makes everything <lb/>
            in its integrity, and he implies this by concealing the royal <lb/>
            name of Lord, as one which bears with it supreme authority; <lb/>
            therefore now also, since what he is describing is the begin­ <lb/>
            ning of the renewed generation of mankind, he borrows for his <lb/>
            description the beneficent virtue, which bears the name of <lb/>
            God; for he used the kingly attribute, which declares his <lb/>
            imperial power, by which he is called Lord, when he was <lb/>
            describing the punishment inflicted by the flood.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " He took of the <lb/>
            cattle and of the flying animals, and he offered whole burnt <lb/>
            offerings on the altar ?"*</p>
          <p>52. All this is said with reference to an inward meaning, <lb/>
            both because he received everything from God as a favour and <lb/>
            gift; and also because he took of the clean sorts of animals, <lb/>
            and burnt those which were unpolluted and clean, as entire <lb/>
            and pure first fruits; for they are proper victims for good men <lb/>
            to offer, and are themselves entire, being full of integrity; and <lb/>
            they may be classed as fruits, for fruit is the end, for the sake <lb/>
            of which the plant exists.</p>
          <p>This indeed is the literal statement; but with respect to <lb/>
            the inner meaning, the clean cattle and the clean birds are <lb/>
            the outward senses and intellect of the wise man, with the <lb/>
            thoughts which are received in his mind; all which things it <lb/>
            is reasonable to offer in their integrity as entire and perfect <lb/>
            fruit, in the way of a display of gratitude to the Father, and to <lb/>
            offer them to him as an unpolluted and clean oblation of a <lb/>
            victim.</p>
          <p>Why does he offer his sacrifice to the beneficent virtue of <lb/>
            God, but the acceptance of it takes place by means of both the <lb/>
            qualities of the Lord and God, for Moses says, "And the <lb/>
            Lord God smelled a savour of sweetness ?"t</p>
          <p>53. He says this since, when unexpectedly, after all hope <lb/>
            is gone, we are preserved from dangers which are coming over <lb/>
            us, we then, looking solely at the beneficence of him who has <lb/>
            preserved us, do, on account of our joy, display ingratitude, <lb/>
            and refer the benefits which we have received rather to the be­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 20. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            neficent power than to the Lora. But the beneficent preserver <lb/>
            himself, by means of both his attributes, looks down upon and <lb/>
            honourably accepts grateful minds, that he may not appear to <lb/>
            halt in rewarding them; but he declares that such a display of, <lb/>
            gratitude is pleasing to both attributes of the one God.*</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, "And the Lord God <lb/>
            said, repenting him, I will not again proceed to curse the <lb/>
            earth for the works of man, for the thoughts of the mind of <lb/>
            man are toward, and are diligently and ceaselessly exercised in, <lb/>
            wickedness from his youth up; therefore I will not now pro­ <lb/>
            ceed to smite all living flesh as I have done at other times ?”†</p>
          <p>54. The reasons alleged appear to indicate a change of <lb/>
            purpose, which is an affection not usual nor akin to the divine <lb/>
            virtue; for the dispositions of mankind are variable and incon­ <lb/>
            \ stant, so that all affairs among them are altogether uncertain; <lb/>
            but with God nothing is uncertain, nothing incomprehensible, <lb/>
            for he is a being of mighty and consistent determination ; how <lb/>
            then, when reasons of the same kind are present to him, be­ <lb/>
            cause he was forsooth aware from the very beginning that the <lb/>
            mind of man was deliberately inclined to wallow in wickedness <lb/>
            from his youth on, could he have originally intended to destroy <lb/>
            the human race by a flood; and yet afterwards say, that he <lb/>
            did not intend to destroy it any more, when the same evils <lb/>
            still exist in the mind ? But we must think that every kind of <lb/>
            expression of this sort is, by law, connected with learning and <lb/>
            the utility of instruction rather than with the nature of truth, <lb/>
            since there are, as it were, two kinds which occur in the whole <lb/>
            course of the law; in the first place, as it is said, “ Not as a <lb/>
            man;" and in the second place, as it is said, " As a man," the <lb/>
            one God is believed to instruct his son.</p>
          <p>That first expression relates to the actual truth; for, in real <lb/>
            fact, God is not as a man, nor again, as the sun, nor as the <lb/>
            heaven, nor as the world, which is perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, but as God, if it is justifiable to assert that also ; since <lb/>
            that most happy and blessed being will not endure similitude, <lb/>
            or comparison, or enigmatical description; nay, rather he sur­ <note type="footnote"> * Or, “ But the one God very much likes to act by means of both his <lb/>
            attributes.”—Note to the Latin version. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis viii. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            passes even blessedness and felicity itself, and whatever can be <lb/>
            imagined as better than and preferable to them.</p>
          <p>But the second expression relates to instruction and direc­ <lb/>
            tion, I mean the express words, " As a man," in order that it <lb/>
            may be observed, that he is willing to impress us beings, born <lb/>
            of the earth, lest perchance we should unceasingly incur his <lb/>
            anger and his chastisement by our implacable hostility to him, <lb/>
            without any peace ; for it is sufficient for him to be roused and <lb/>
            embittered against us once, and once to exact vengeance against <lb/>
            sinners ; but to inflict punishment over and over again for the <lb/>
            same thing is the conduct of a savage and ferocious dispo­ <lb/>
            sition: since, says he, “ when I shall inflict deserved retribu­ <lb/>
            tion, as is possible, on every one, I will cause a burning <lb/>
            recollection of my design to be preserved."</p>
          <p>Therefore behold, the sacred historian has excellently ex­ <lb/>
            pressed himself, saying, " That God observed in his mind," <lb/>
            for his mind and disposition rejoice in a superior degree of <lb/>
            constancy; but our wills are found to be inconsistent and <lb/>
            vacillating, on which account we cannot be properly said to <lb/>
            observe and think with our minds, since it is by the thoughts <lb/>
            that the passage of the mind is allowed to take place,* but the <lb/>
            human intellect is unable to be extended over everything, <lb/>
            since it is incapable of penetrating all things in a perfect and <lb/>
            suitable manner.</p>
          <p>But that expression, " I will not proceed any more to curse <lb/>
            the earth," is used with great propriety, for it is not becoming <lb/>
            to add more curses to what has already been done, because the <lb/>
            evils that have been inflicted are already complete; because, <lb/>
            although they are in some sense imperfect, inasmuch as the <lb/>
            Father is kind and merciful, and most humane, still he is <lb/>
            rather inclined to alleviate the evil than to add to men's <lb/>
            misery. But that is as it were the same thing, according to a <lb/>
            common proverb, to wash a brick, or to draw water properly, <lb/>
            and wholly to eradicate wickedness, with all its deeply im­ <lb/>
            printed tokens from the mind of man; for if it is implanted in <lb/>
            it at first, it does not exist accidentally, but is engraven deeply <lb/>
            on it and clings to it.</p>
          <p>But since the mind is a potential and principal part of the <note type="footnote"> * “ If you connect the Armenian words in a different manner, the <lb/>
            sense will be ' meditation is the purification of the course of the mind,' <lb/>
            and this is perhaps better.”—Note by the Latin Translator. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            soul, he introduces that word " diligently;" but that which <lb/>
            has been weighed with diligence and care is exquisite <lb/>
            thought, examined more certainly than certainty itself. But <lb/>
            this diligence does not tend to any one evil, but as is plain, <lb/>
            to mischief, and to all mischief; nor does it exist in a per­ <lb/>
            functory manner; but man is devoted to it from his youth, <lb/>
            not only in a manner, but from his very cradle, as if he <lb/>
            were in some degree united to, and nourished, and bred up <lb/>
            with sin.</p>
          <p>But yet God says, " I will not any more smite all flesh <lb/>
            giving notice that he will not, at any future time, destroy <lb/>
            every portion of mankind altogether, but only single indi­ <lb/>
            viduals, in ever such great numbers, who perpetrate un­ <lb/>
            speakable wickednesses; for he does not leave wickedness <lb/>
            unpunished, nor does he grant it liberty or impunity, but <lb/>
            indulging his care for the human race on account of his <lb/>
            original design, he of necessity fixes destruction as a punish­ <lb/>
            ment for sinners.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Sowing-time and <lb/>
            harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring, shall not cease <lb/>
            day nor night ?"*</p>
          <p>55. If taken literally this expression signifies the con­ <lb/>
            tinuation of the duration of the annual seasons, and that <lb/>
            the earthly temperature adapted to animals and plants is <lb/>
            not again to be destroyed ; since indeed, if the weather <lb/>
            is corrupted it would corrupt them likewise, and if it is <lb/>
            preserved in its existing state it would preserve them also <lb/>
            safe and sound; for it is according to the weather and <lb/>
            temperature that all animals and plants are preserved safe <lb/>
            and sound, without any infirmity, being accustomed, in <lb/>
            some measure, to be produced separately, in an admirable <lb/>
            way, and to grow up together. But nature is like a liar­ <lb/>
            mony, composed of opposite sounds, both flat and sharp ; <lb/>
            for thus, also, the world is compounded of opposite qualities, <lb/>
            for when, in the first place, the mortal commixtures of cold <lb/>
            and heat, of moisture and dryness, preserve their natural <lb/>
            order, without any confusion, they are themselves a cause <lb/>
            which prevents destruction from overwhelming everything <lb/>
            upon the earth. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 22. </note> <pb n="385"/>
            </p>
          <p>But if we regard the inward sense of the passage, the <lb/>
            seed time is the beginning and the harvest time is the end, <lb/>
            and both the beginning and the end are concurrent causes <lb/>
            of safety, for either thing alone is by itself imperfect, be­ <lb/>
            cause the beginning requires an end, and the end has a <lb/>
            natural inclination for the beginning; but cold and heat <lb/>
            bring round winter and autumn; for the autumn is fiery, <lb/>
            but only in such a degree as succeeding in its annual re­ <lb/>
            volution to cool the fiery summer.</p>
          <p>And, symbolically, with reference to the mind, cold <lb/>
            indicates fear, since it causes terror and trepidation; but <lb/>
            heat indicates anger, because an angry disposition bears in <lb/>
            itself a resemblance to flame and fire; for it is necessary <lb/>
            that those things should always exist and always remain <lb/>
            among created and corruptible beings; since summer and <lb/>
            spring have been instituted for the production of fruits; <lb/>
            spring for the perfecting of the seeds, and summer for the <lb/>
            perfecting of fruits and the buds of trees.</p>
          <p>These things indeed are discerned symbolically in addition <lb/>
            to the inward sense of the words, producing a double fruit; <lb/>
            what is necessary being computed in the season of spring, <lb/>
            and what is superfluous in the summer. Therefore neces­ <lb/>
            sary food is for the most part for the body, being whatever <lb/>
            is produced freely from seeds; as virtues are necessary for <lb/>
            the soul. But as many fruits as come by way of excess <lb/>
            from trees in summer, besides the advantage which they are <lb/>
            to the body, do also bring corporeal goods to the mind, as <lb/>
            external advantages: for these external advantages are <lb/>
            subservient to the body, and the body is subservient to the <lb/>
            mind, and the mind to God. But day and night are the <lb/>
            measures of times and numbers ; and time and number exist <lb/>
            without interruption. Day indicates lucid wisdom, and <lb/>
            night betokens obscure folly.</p>
          <p>Why was it that God, blessing Noah and his sons, said, <lb/>
            “ Increase, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and rule <lb/>
            over it; and let your fear and the dread of you be upon all <lb/>
            beasts, and upon flying fowls, and upon reptiles, and upon <lb/>
            the fishes which I have placed under your hand ? " *</p>
          <p>56. This devotion of the inferior animals to man, God <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            also at the beginning of the creation bestowed on the sixth <lb/>
            day upon man, after he had created him in his own image; <lb/>
            for the scripture saith, " And God made man; in the image <lb/>
            of God created he him; male and female created he them. <lb/>
            And God blessed them, and said, Be fruitful,-and multiply, <lb/>
            and replenish the earth ; and be ye lords over it, and be ye <lb/>
            rulers of the fishes, and of the flying fowls, and of every <lb/>
            creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth."</p>
          <p>And did he not by these words evidently intimate that <lb/>
            Noah, at the beginning of what we may call the second <lb/>
            creation of mankind, was found equal in honour to that <lb/>
            creature who in the first instance was made as to his form <lb/>
            in the likeness of himself? Therefore he equally assigned <lb/>
            both to the one and to the other the principality and power <lb/>
            over all the creatures that live upon the earth.</p>
          <p>But do thou diligently take notice that he showed this <lb/>
            man, who at the time of the deluge was the only just man <lb/>
            and the king of all the creatures which live upon the earth, <lb/>
            to be equal in honour, not to the identical man who was first <lb/>
            created and formed out of the earth, but to that one who <lb/>
            was made according to the likeness and form of the true in­ <lb/>
            corporeal entity, to whom also he gives power, making him <lb/>
            a king, not the very created man (or the man formed out of <lb/>
            the earth), but him who is according to his form and <lb/>
            similitude, that is to say, incorporeal.</p>
          <p>Wherefore also the creation of that man, who as to his <lb/>
            form is incorporeal, was marked to have taken place on the <lb/>
            sixth day, in accordance with the perfect number six; but <lb/>
            the creation of that man who was created after the com­ <lb/>
            pletion of the world and subsequent to the generation of all <lb/>
            animals on the seventh day, because it is after that that the <lb/>
            manly figure was fashioned out of clay. Therefore after the <lb/>
            days of generation he says, " on the seventh day of the <lb/>
            world;" for God had not yet rained upon the earth, and no <lb/>
            man did exist who could cultivate the earth. And then he <lb/>
            proceeds to say, " But God formed a man out of the clay of <lb/>
            the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life, and <lb/>
            man became a living soul."</p>
          <p>Therefore how he can be made worthy of the same kingly <lb/>
            power according to the image of the man thus formed, he, I <lb/>
            mean, who is the beginning of the second creation of man­ <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            kind, is indicated by the letter of the history that relates <lb/>
            these events.</p>
          <p>But with reference to the inward sense of the passage we <lb/>
            must give an explanation in the following manner. God <lb/>
            wills that the souls of wise men should increase in the <lb/>
            magnitude and multitude of the beauty of their virtues, and <lb/>
            should fill the mind as if it were the earth with those <lb/>
            beauties, leaving no portion empty and void so as to become <lb/>
            occupied by folly. And he wills also that they should rule <lb/>
            over, and strike terror into, and inflict alarm upon all <lb/>
            beasts; that is to say, he wills that all wickedness should <lb/>
            be subdued by their will, since wickedness is of an untamed <lb/>
            and savage nature. Also he willed that they should be <lb/>
            lords over all flying fowls, which by reason of their lightness <lb/>
            are raised on high, being armed with courage and empty <lb/>
            pride, and which thus cause the greatest mischief, being <lb/>
            scarcely controlled at all by fear. Moreover, he made them <lb/>
            rulers over all creeping things, which are the symbols of <lb/>
            destructive vices, for they creep through the whole soul, <lb/>
            namely, concupiscence, desire, sadness, and cowardice, <lb/>
            striking and goading; as also they are indicated by the <lb/>
            fishes, which eagerly cultivate a moist and delicate life, but <lb/>
            one which is far from being sober, wise, or lasting.</p>
          <p>Why does God say, "Every creeping thing which lives <lb/>
            shall be to you for food ? " *</p>
          <p>57. Creeping things are of a twofold nature; some being <lb/>
            venomous, and others domestic. The venomous ones are <lb/>
            serpents, which, instead of feet, use their bellies and breasts, <lb/>
            creeping upon the earth; but the domestic ones are those <lb/>
            which have legs above their feet. This is the literal <lb/>
            meaning of the statement.</p>
          <p>But if we look to the inward sense of it, then the creeping <lb/>
            things represent the foul vices, but the clean ones repre­ <lb/>
            sent joy; for in connexion with the passion of concupiscence <lb/>
            there will exist joy and pleasure; and in connexion with <lb/>
            desire there will be will and counsel, and in connexion with <lb/>
            sorrow goading and compunction, and in connexion with <lb/>
            avidity there will be fear.</p>
          <p>Therefore such disordered perturbations of the passions <note type="footnote"> * Genesis is. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> C C 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            threaten souls with death and destruction; but the joys do <lb/>
            really live, as he himself has warned us in an allegory; and <lb/>
            they also give life to those who possess them.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " As the green <lb/>
            herb I have given you all things ? " *</p>
          <p>58. Some persons say that by this expression, "As the <lb/>
            green herb I have given you all things," the eating of flesh <lb/>
            was permitted. But I say that even though God had <lb/>
            intended to give that permission, still that before all things <lb/>
            he must have intended to establish by law the necessary use <lb/>
            of herbs, that is to say of vegetables. And under the <lb/>
            general name of herb he includes all the other additional <lb/>
            descriptions of green food, without mentioning them ex­ <lb/>
            pressly in the law. But now the power of this command is <lb/>
            adapted not to one nation alone among all the select nations <lb/>
            of the earth which are desirous of wisdom, among which <lb/>
            religious continence is honoured, but to all mankind, who <lb/>
            cannot possibly be universally prohibited from eating flesh.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, perhaps the present expression has no re­ <lb/>
            ference to eating food, but rather to the possession of the <lb/>
            power to do so; for in fact every herb is not necessarily <lb/>
            good to eat, nor again is it the uniform and invariable food <lb/>
            of all uniform living animals; since God said that some <lb/>
            herbs were poisonous and deadly, and yet they are included <lb/>
            in the number all. Perhaps therefore, I say, he means to <lb/>
            express this, that all brute beasts are subjected to the <lb/>
            power of man, as we sow herbs and take care of them by <lb/>
            the cultivation of the land.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " You shall not <lb/>
            eat flesh in the blood of its life ? " t</p>
          <p>59. God appears by this command to indicate that the <lb/>
            blood is the substance of the soul; I mean of that soul <lb/>
            which exists by the external senses and by vitality, not of <lb/>
            that which is spoken of with a certain especial pre-eminence, <lb/>
            being the rational and intellectual soul; for there are three <lb/>
            parts of the human soul; one the nutritive part, another <lb/>
            that which is connected with the external senses, and the <lb/>
            third that which exists in reason. Therefore the rational <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 3. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis is 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            pare is the substance of the divine spirit according to the <lb/>
            sacred writer Moses: for in his account of the creation of <lb/>
            the world, he says, " God breathed into his face the breath <lb/>
            of life," as being what was to constitute his life. But of <lb/>
            that part of the soul which is connected with the external <lb/>
            senses and with vitality, blood is the substance ; for he says <lb/>
            in another place, "The blood exists in every breath of flesh."</p>
          <p>It is with great propriety in fact that he has called the <lb/>
            blood the breath of all flesh, because there are in the flesh <lb/>
            senses and passions, but not intellect nor thoughts. But <lb/>
            again by the expression "the spirit of blood," he intimates that <lb/>
            the spirit is one thing and the blood another; so that the <lb/>
            essence of the soul is truly and beyond all possible question <lb/>
            spirit. But that spirit has a place not by itself separately, <lb/>
            apart from the blood in the body; but it is interwoven and <lb/>
            mingled with the blood.</p>
          <p>As also the veins which exhibit a pulse, as if they were <lb/>
            vessels to convey breathing, bear with them most unmixed <lb/>
            and pure air, but blood likewise, though perhaps in a less <lb/>
            degree; for there are two vessels, the veins and the <lb/>
            breathing channels; but the veins have more blood than <lb/>
            breath, and the breathing channels have more breath than <lb/>
            blood. Therefore the proper admixture in each vessel is <lb/>
            distinct, as the greater and the lesser proportion.</p>
          <p>This is the meaning of these words when taken literally; <lb/>
            but if we look to their inner meaning, he calls the blood of <lb/>
            the soul that warm and fiery virtue belonging to it which we <lb/>
            name courage. And he who is full of this wisdom despises <lb/>
            all food, and every pleasure of the belly, and of those parts <lb/>
            which are below the belly. But if any one adopts a profli­ <lb/>
            gate life, and becomes a wanderer like the wind, and <lb/>
            gradually inactive from laziness and a luxurious life, he in <lb/>
            fact does nothing else but fall upon his belly, as a reptile <lb/>
            creeping upon the earth, and greedily licking up earthly <lb/>
            things, closing his life without ever tasting of that heavenly <lb/>
            food which the souls which are desirous of wisdom receive.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, "The blood of <lb/>
            your souls will I require from every beast, and from the <lb/>
            hand of man's brother will I require the life of man ? " * <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 5. </note> <pb n="390"/>
            </p>
          <p>60. The multitude of creatures which do injury is'two­ <lb/>
            fold; some being beasts, and others men. But beasts are <lb/>
            rather the least injurious of the two, because they have no <lb/>
            actual familiarity with those whom they wish to injure, <lb/>
            principally because they do not fall under their power, but <lb/>
            destroy those who have properly power over them. But <lb/>
            when he speaks of brothers, he means men who are <lb/>
            murderers, intimating these three things. First of all, that <lb/>
            all we men are akin to one another, and are brothers, being <lb/>
            connected with one another according to the relation of the <lb/>
            highest kind of kindred; for we have received a lot, as being <lb/>
            the children of one and the same mother, rational nature.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he intimates that very commonly <lb/>
            numerous and terrible quarrels arise, and acts of treachery <lb/>
            take place, between relations, and rather between brothers, <lb/>
            on account of the division of their inheritance, or on account <lb/>
            of some superiority of dignity in the household; since a <lb/>
            quarrel between those of the same family is worse and alto­ <lb/>
            gether unseemly, because brothers who are really so by the <lb/>
            ties of nature meet in contest with a great knowledge of <lb/>
            one another's internal circumstances; being therefore well <lb/>
            aware what kind of attack they must employ in their <lb/>
            present warfare.</p>
          <p>But, in the third place, as it appears to me, be employs <lb/>
            the appellation of brothers in order to warn men of the im­ <lb/>
            placable and severe punishment which is reserved for mur­ <lb/>
            derers; that they, without meeting any compassion, shall <lb/>
            suffer what they have inflicted; for they have not slain <lb/>
            strangers, but their own brothers in blood.</p>
          <p>It is with exceeding great propriety that he calls God the <lb/>
            protector and overseer of those who are slain by man ; for <lb/>
            although men despise the revenge, yet let them not behave <lb/>
            negligently, but although impure men of savage disposition <lb/>
            escape for the moment from danger, still let them know <lb/>
            that they are already caught and brought before the greater <lb/>
            tribunal of justice, namely, before the divine judgment­ <lb/>
            seat, which rises up to inflict vengeance on the wicked for <lb/>
            the defence of those who have received shameful and un­ <lb/>
            worthy treatment.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of the words; but if we look <lb/>
            to the inward sense of them they have a regard to the merit of <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            the purity of the soul, to which it is suitable to avoid unceas­ <lb/>
            ing destruction brought in from outward parts; which merit, <lb/>
            that propitious and beneficent being, the most merciful and <lb/>
            only Saviour, does not despise; but he expels and destroys <lb/>
            all its enemies who stand around it, calling them beasts, and <lb/>
            men brothers; for beasts are asymbolical expression for furious <lb/>
            men threatening calamitous death; but men and brothers <lb/>
            are both separate individual thoughts, and words uttered by <lb/>
            mouth and tongue, because they are akin to them, and, by <lb/>
            consequence, they bring on great and destructive evils, <lb/>
            leaving no stone unturned, no work or word omitted to do <lb/>
            injury.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, "Whoso sheddeth <lb/>
            man's blood by man shall his blood be shed ? "*</p>
          <p>61. There is no excess in this declaration, but rather an <lb/>
            indication of a still more formidable denunciation, because he <lb/>
            says, " He himself shall be poured out like blood who pours <lb/>
            out blood." For that which is poured out flows forth and <lb/>
            is lost, so that it has no longer any power or substance. <lb/>
            And by this he shadows forth the fact that the souls of those <lb/>
            who perpetrate unworthy actions imitate the mortal body <lb/>
            in its corruption, as far as corruption is accustomed to come <lb/>
            upon individuals; for the body is then dissolved into those <lb/>
            parts of which it was composed, returning into its proper <lb/>
            elements. But the miserable soul, labouring under distresses, <lb/>
            is borne hither and thither by the overflow of a lascivious <lb/>
            life; and the very evils which have grown up along with it <lb/>
            are accustomed to suffer the same overflow, in the manner of <lb/>
            the parts of the limbs.</p>
          <p>Wby is it that he speaks as if of some other god, saying <lb/>
            that he made man after the image of God, and not that he <lb/>
            made him after his own image ?t</p>
          <p>62. Very appropriately and without any falsehood was <lb/>
            this oracular sentence uttered by God, for no mortal thing <lb/>
            could have been formed on the similitude of the supreme <lb/>
            Father of the universe, but only after the pattern of the <lb/>
            second deity, who is the Word of the supreme Being; <lb/>
            since it is fitting that the rational soul of man should <note type="footnote"> * Genesis is. 6. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            bear before it the type of the divine Word; since in his <lb/>
            first Word God is superior to the most rational possible <lb/>
            nature. But he who is superior to the Word holds his rank <lb/>
            in a better and most singular pre-eminence, and how could <lb/>
            the creature possibly exhibit a likeness of him in himself ? <lb/>
            Nevertheless he also wished to intimate this fact, that God <lb/>
            does rightly and correctly require vengeance, in order to the <lb/>
            defence of virtuous and consistent men, because such bear <lb/>
            in themselves a familiar acquaintance with his Word, of <lb/>
            which the human mind is the similitude and form.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, " There shall not again <lb/>
            be a deluge to destroy all the earth ? "*</p>
          <p>63. By his last saying he declares sufficiently that there <lb/>
            may be various inundations, but that there shall never be <lb/>
            one of such a character as to be able to change the whole <lb/>
            earth into a lake or sea.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of this saying.</p>
          <p>But if we look to its inward sense, there a divine kindness <lb/>
            is intimated, according to which, although it is not every <lb/>
            part of the soul which is allowed to make proficiency in <lb/>
            every virtue, still some are adorned in a considerable degree. <lb/>
            So that, supposing any one is not able to display excellence <lb/>
            in his whole body, he still may labour with all diligence to <lb/>
            acquire all the means in his power to display excellence; <lb/>
            and that exertion is within his reach. And it does not <lb/>
            follow that if any one is less highly endowed, or is unable <lb/>
            to make every portion of his life altogether perfect, that he <lb/>
            is on that account to despair of those things which he is <lb/>
            able to do and to attain to.</p>
          <p>Since as there is power in every individual, he who <lb/>
            does not exert himself in accordance with it is both idle <lb/>
            and ungrateful; idle because of his laziness, and ungrateful <lb/>
            because, though he has received most excellent means, he <lb/>
            still sets himself in opposition to the essential qualities of <lb/>
            things.</p>
          <p>Why does God say that, as a sign that he will never again <lb/>
            bring a deluge over the whole earth, he will place his bow <lb/>
            in the clouds ? † <note type="footnote"> * Genesis is. 11. </note><note type="footnote">f Genesis ix. 13. </note> <pb n="393"/>
            </p>
          <p>64. Some persons imagine that by the bow he means that <lb/>
            thing which by some is called Jupiter's belt, from its figure, <lb/>
            dwelling on its continual similitude to the rainbow ; but I do <lb/>
            not perceive that that has been positively asserted. In the <lb/>
            first place, because the bow aforesaid ought to have a pe­ <lb/>
            culiar and essential nature of its own, because it is called <lb/>
            the bow of God ; for he says, " I will set my bow in the <lb/>
            clouds." But that which belongs to God and is said to have <lb/>
            been set in any place as his, indicates plainly that it is not <lb/>
            devoid of essence or of substance.</p>
          <p>But the belt of Jupiter has not, properly speaking, any <lb/>
            separate nature of its own, but is merely an appearance of <lb/>
            the solar rays on a wet cloud, all the phenomena of which <lb/>
            are non-existent and incorporeal. And moreover, this is a <lb/>
            further proof of that, that it is never seen at night, though <lb/>
            clouds exist by night as well as by day.</p>
          <p>In the second place, we must also say that even in the <lb/>
            day-time, when clouds obscure the whole face of heaven, <lb/>
            the belt of Jupiter is never at all seen in them. But what <lb/>
            remains may also be affirmed without any falsehood, when <lb/>
            the Maker of the law says, "I will set my bow in the clouds;" <lb/>
            for, behold, while clouds are present there is no appear­ <lb/>
            ance of the belt of Jupiter visible. But he said, " Where <lb/>
            there is a collection of clouds let there be a bow seen in the <lb/>
            clouds." Still it often happens, when the clouds are col­ <lb/>
            lected and when the air is obscured and thickened, that no <lb/>
            appearance of a rainbow is seen anywhere.</p>
          <p>We must consider, therefore, whether haply the sacred <lb/>
            historian indicates something else by this mention of the <lb/>
            bow, namely, that in the very exercise of the mercy of God, <lb/>
            and also in the moment of his bitterness towards men on <lb/>
            earth, there still shall not be any ultimate destruction of <lb/>
            them, in the fashion of a bow, which is too soft and unfit <lb/>
            for such a purpose, nor shall there be any violence added, so <lb/>
            as to cause a rapid destruction, but there shall be a mode­ <lb/>
            rate determination, each attribute being carefully measured; <lb/>
            for the great deluge took place with a breaking asunder and <lb/>
            disruption of the clouds and of all things ; as he himself <lb/>
            asserts, when he says, " The fountains of the deep were <lb/>
            broken up." And yet it was not an unmeasured vehemence.</p>
          <p>Moreover, a bow is not itself a weapon, but only an in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            strument for the use of weapons, namely, for the arrow <lb/>
            which strikes ; and the arrow being sent forth by means of <lb/>
            the bow strikes a part which is at a distance, while the parts <lb/>
            which are nearest to it remain unhurt. And this is given as a <lb/>
            proof that the whole earth shall never for the future suffer <lb/>
            any deluge, since no one arrow ever hits all places, but only <lb/>
            those which are at a distance.</p>
          <p>Therefore the divine virtue, being invisible, is symbolically <lb/>
            indicated by the bow in the cloud; being in truth dissolved <lb/>
            according to the figure of tranquillity, and condensed in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with a cloud; so that it does not permit all the <lb/>
            clouds to be altogether dissolved into water, so that the <lb/>
            earth may not be made a lake by an inundation, which it <lb/>
            carefully forbids, and arranges the condensation of air, <lb/>
            checking it as by a bridle, though it is at that time the more <lb/>
            accustomed to exhibit itself as rebellious by reason of its <lb/>
            excessive fulness. For by reason of the clouds it also shows <lb/>
            itself to be replenished, dripping, and saturated.</p>
          <p>Why is it that after the sons of the just man have been <lb/>
            named Shem, Ham, and Japhet, he relates only the genera­ <lb/>
            tions of the middle one, saying, " And Ham was the father of <lb/>
            Canaan;" and afterwards be adds, “These are the three sons <lb/>
            of Noah</p>
          <p>65. Mentioning four men, Noah and his sons, he says that <lb/>
            these were obedient. Because the grandson Canaan was in <lb/>
            his habits like his father who begat him, on that account, <lb/>
            instead of mentioning only one, he includes both in his <lb/>
            enumeration, so that they are four in number, three in <lb/>
            virtue. But in the meantime in the scripture he mentions <lb/>
            only the generations of the middle one, on account of the <lb/>
            just man whom he is going to speak of subsequently, because <lb/>
            although he was his father, since Ham is the father of <lb/>
            Canaan, still he does not mention the father with blame, <lb/>
            but with respect to the man with whom he thought it fair <lb/>
            that the son should be a partaker, he yet did not give the <lb/>
            father a participation with him.</p>
          <p>In the second place, perhaps he thus gives a premonitory <lb/>
            warning also to those persons who by the acuteness of their <lb/>
            mental vision can see a long way off what is at a distance, <note type="footnote"> Genesis ix 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            namely, that he designs to take away the land of the Canaan­ <lb/>
            ites from them after the lapse of many ages, and to give it <lb/>
            to his chosen people who are thoroughly devoted to God. <lb/>
            Therefore he chooses to designate the chief inhabitant <lb/>
            of that region, namely Canaan, and to show that he both <lb/>
            practised singular and peculiar wickedness of his own, and <lb/>
            also' all the wickedness of his father, so that in every part <lb/>
            he might be convicted of an ignoble slavery and submission.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of these words. But if we <lb/>
            have a regard to the inward sense, he does not say that Ham <lb/>
            had a son named Canaan, but he predicates offspring of him <lb/>
            alone, saying, “Ham was the father of Canaan." Since such <lb/>
            a disposition as that of Ham is always the father of such <lb/>
            designs as those of Canaan, and that the very names <lb/>
            themselves intimate this. For if we translate them into <lb/>
            another language, Ham means heat or hot; and Canaan <lb/>
            means merchants, or buyers, or causes, or recipients.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, he is not now speaking manifestly of genera­ <lb/>
            tions, nor is he saying that one man is the father or the son <lb/>
            of another man, but he is evidently demonstrating the connec­ <lb/>
            tion between one counsel and another, by reason of its <lb/>
            alienation from all familiarity with virtue.</p>
          <ab>
            <title type="sub">About the cultivation of the earth.</title>
          </ab>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " Noah began to be <lb/>
            a cultivator of the earth ? "*</p>
          <p>66. He is here comparing Noah to the first created man <lb/>
            who was formed out of the earth ; for in that manner also <lb/>
            does he speak of him when he came forth out of the ark; <lb/>
            since both then and now there took place a first beginning <lb/>
            of the cultivation of the land, each being after a deluge. <lb/>
            For also, at the time of the original creation of the world <lb/>
            the earth was, as it were, a lake, being covered by an inunda­ <lb/>
            tion of water, for the sacred historian could not tell us that <lb/>
            God said," Let the waters be gathered together into one body, <lb/>
            and let the dry land appear," unless it had previously been <lb/>
            inundated with waters which now returned into certain <lb/>
            depths of the earth.</p>
          <p>Nor again is the expression a purposeless one," He began <lb/>
            to be a tiller of the earth," for in the second generation he <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            was himself the beginning of men, and also of seed, and of <lb/>
            the cultivation of the land, and of the life of all other things. <lb/>
            This is the literal meaning of the words.</p>
          <p>But if we look to their inner sense, a distinction is made <lb/>
            between being a cultivator of the earth and a tiller'of it; <lb/>
            as the murderer of his brother is represented as tilling the <lb/>
            earth, but not as cultivating it. For by the earth o ur body is <lb/>
            symbolically represented, which is by its nature earthly, and <lb/>
            which the unjust and wicked man tills like a lazy hireling, <lb/>
            but which the man endued with virtue cultivates like a <lb/>
            skilful manager of plants and an agriculturist of good works <lb/>
            appointed to superintend it. Because the workman of the <lb/>
            body, the mind, as being carnal, procures carnal pleasures; <lb/>
            but the cultivator of the earth is careful to produce useful <lb/>
            fruits, those, namely, which are to be obtained by the study <lb/>
            of continence, and modesty, and sound wisdom ; and he <lb/>
            prunes away all superfluous excesses and bad habits which <lb/>
            spring up around, like the thin and misplaced branches of <lb/>
            trees.</p>
          <p>Why does the just man first plant a vineyard ? *</p>
          <p>It was very natural for it to be a subject of anxiety and <lb/>
            doubt to him in what quarter he was to find any plants after <lb/>
            the deluge, when everything upon the earth was destroyed. <lb/>
            Therefore it appeared natural, as was said a little while ago, <lb/>
            that the earth was made dry in the spring season; therefore <lb/>
            when the spring produced the buds of trees, the roots and <lb/>
            stems of the vine could easily be found by the just man still <lb/>
            alive, and might thus be collected by him.</p>
          <p>But we have to consider why the first thing he did was to <lb/>
            plant a vineyard, and why he did not rather sow wheat and <lb/>
            barley, since the latter are necessary productions of the <lb/>
            earth, without which life cannot be supported, but the <lb/>
            former is only a material for superfluous pleasure. The <lb/>
            answer is that Noah, adopting a salutary design, consecrated <lb/>
            and offered up to God those things which are necessary to <lb/>
            support life and which require no co-operation for the <lb/>
            production of the fruit; but the superfluous plants he devoted <lb/>
            to men; for the use of wine is superfluous and not necessary. <lb/>
            As therefore God ordered fountains of water fit to drink to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 30. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            burst up from the earth without the co-operation of man, <lb/>
            so he also of his own accord granted to man in a similar <lb/>
            manner wheat and barley, in order that he himself might be <lb/>
            the sole giver of each kind of food which serves for necessary <lb/>
            eating and drinking. But he did not take away the power <lb/>
            nor grudge them providing for themselves by their own <lb/>
            industry those things which contribute to pleasure.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " He drank of the <lb/>
            wine and was drunken ?" *</p>
          <p>68. In the first place, the just man did not drink the <lb/>
            wine, but a portion of the wine, not the whole of it; in which <lb/>
            case an incontinent and debauched man does not quit his <lb/>
            means of debauchery, till he has first swallowed all the wine <lb/>
            that there is before him ; but by the religious and sober man <lb/>
            everything necessary for food is used in a moderate degree. <lb/>
            And the expression, " be was drunken," is here to be taken <lb/>
            simply as equivalent to " he used the wine."</p>
          <p>But there are two modes of getting drunk, the one is that <lb/>
            of an intemperate sottishness which misuses wine, and this <lb/>
            offence is peculiar to the depraved and wicked man; the <lb/>
            other is the use of wine, and this belongs to the wise. It is <lb/>
            therefore in the second of these meanings that the consistent <lb/>
            and wise Noah is here called drunken, not as having misused <lb/>
            but as having used wine.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " He was naked in <lb/>
            his house? "t</p>
          <p>69. This is a praise of the wise man both in the literal <lb/>
            sense of the words, and also in their hidden meaning, that his <lb/>
            exhibition of nakedness took place not out of doors but in <lb/>
            his house, being concealed by the roof and walls of his <lb/>
            house; for the nakedness of the body is concealed by a <lb/>
            house which is made of stones and beams of wood: but the <lb/>
            covering and clothing of the soul is the discipline of wisdom.</p>
          <p>Therefore there are two kinds of nakedness, one which <lb/>
            takes place by accident, which is the result of an involuntary <lb/>
            offence, because the just man, using, if Imay say so, his honesty <lb/>
            as if it were a garment with which he is clothed, stumbles <lb/>
            out of his own accord like men who are intoxicated, or who <note type="footnote"> Genesis ix. 21. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            are afflicted with insanity; for in such men their offences <lb/>
            are not deliberately committed : but it is his task and pleasing <lb/>
            duty to clothe himself, as with a garment, with the discipline <lb/>
            and study of honesty.</p>
          <p>There is also another kind of nakedness of the soul which <lb/>
            is caused by perfect virtue, which expels from itself the <lb/>
            whole carnal weight of the body, as if it were flying from a <lb/>
            tomb, as indeed it has long been buried in it as in a tomb ; <lb/>
            as also it avoids pleasures, and also a great number of <lb/>
            miseries arising from the different passions and many anxieties <lb/>
            arising from misfortunes, and indeed all the evil effects of <lb/>
            these different circumstances. He therefore, who has been <lb/>
            able with distinction to pass through such various and great <lb/>
            dangers, and to escape such injuries, and to emancipate <lb/>
            himself from such evils, has attained to the destiny of hap­ <lb/>
            piness, without any stain or disgrace ; for I should pronounce <lb/>
            this to be the ornament and badge of beauty in those <lb/>
            individuals who have been rendered worthy to pass their <lb/>
            existence in an incorporeal manner.</p>
          <p>Why is it that the sacred writer has not simply said, <lb/>
            Ham saw his nakedness, but Ham the father of Canaan <lb/>
            saw the nakedness of his father ? *</p>
          <p>70. By stating the fact thus, he both blames the son in the <lb/>
            father and the father in the son, as performing together in <lb/>
            common the deed of folly, and iniquity, and impiety, and every <lb/>
            other kind of wickedness. This is the literal meaning of <lb/>
            the statement; and as to the inner sense, we must look at <lb/>
            that in the same manner in which we have hitherto treated <lb/>
            these subjects.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " He told it to his <lb/>
            two brothers out of doors ? " t</p>
          <p>71. The sacred historian is here adding to the gravity of <lb/>
            the transaction. In the first place, because he did not report <lb/>
            the involuntary evil of his father to one brother only, but to <lb/>
            both of them ; and no doubt if he had had any more he would <lb/>
            have told it to them all, as he did in fact to every one he <lb/>
            could; and he did so with ridicule in his very words, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 22. </note><note type="footnote">† Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            making a jest of what ought not to have been treated with <lb/>
            laughter and derision, but rather with shame and fear min­ <lb/>
            gled with reverence.</p>
          <p>In the second place,. when the historian says he told it <lb/>
            them, not in the house but out of the house, he evidently <lb/>
            points out that he displayed his father when naked, not only <lb/>
            to his brothers, but also to the bystanders with whom they <lb/>
            were, both men and women.</p>
          <p>This is the literal information conveyed by the words. <lb/>
            But if we look to their inward meaning, then we shall see <lb/>
            that a depraved and malignant habit of life is full of derision <lb/>
            and contempt: and it is a bad thing to judge of the miseries <lb/>
            of others even by one's self like a chastising judge. But in <lb/>
            this case what has happened is worse than this, for any man <lb/>
            with a joyful mind to ridicule the involuntary misfortune of <lb/>
            a devoted disciple of wisdom, and to make a song of and <lb/>
            proclaim abroad his misery, is the part of a thoroughly hostile <lb/>
            accuser, who ought rather to have pardoned such an <lb/>
            occurrence than to have added accusation or vituperation <lb/>
            to it.</p>
          <p>Moreover, because these three things are, as I have said <lb/>
            before, as it were brothers together ; namely, good, bad, and <lb/>
            indifferent, being all the offspring of one parent thought: <lb/>
            in accordance with each of these principles, they have been <lb/>
            found to be overseers, some celebrating virtues with praise, <lb/>
            others upholding acts of malignity, and others supporting <lb/>
            riches and honours and other good things which, however, are <lb/>
            not attached to and which are external to the body.</p>
          <p>The overseers who emulate wickedness rejoice at the fall <lb/>
            of the wise man, and ridicule and disparage him, as if he had <lb/>
            done no good by the part which he adopts and to which he <lb/>
            applies himself as better for the mind, or for his body, or for <lb/>
            his external circumstances, to his internal virtues or to any <lb/>
            of the good things which are around and exterior to his body. <lb/>
            Unless indeed that man alone is eminently able to attain his <lb/>
            object, who applies himself to iniquity, as that alone is ac­ <lb/>
            customed to confer advantages on human life.</p>
          <p>Pronouncing these and similar precepts, those who are <lb/>
            overseers of iniquity ridicule those who devote themselves <lb/>
            to virtue, and to those things by which virtue is produced <lb/>
            and consolidated: as some look upon those things to be <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            which are around the body, and outside it, and which may be <lb/>
            regarded in the light of instruments serving to that end.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " Shem and Japhet, <lb/>
            taking a garment, laid it upon both their shoulders and went <lb/>
            backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father, and <lb/>
            they themselves did not see it ? " *</p>
          <p>72. The literal meaning of the statement is evident; but <lb/>
            with respect to the inner sense contained in it, we must say <lb/>
            that the light man who is in too great haste only sees those <lb/>
            things which are before his eyes and exposed to his sight: <lb/>
            but that the evil man also sees those things which are at <lb/>
            his back, that is to say, the future.</p>
          <p>And since what is posterior is postponed to what is an­ <lb/>
            terior, so is what is future to what is present, the sight of <lb/>
            which is peculiar to the virtuous and wise man, who in truth <lb/>
            is a second Lynceus, being according to the fables gifted <lb/>
            with eyes in every part.</p>
          <p>Therefore every wise man, who is not so much man as <lb/>
            actual intellect, walks backward, that is to say, he sees <lb/>
            what is behind him or future, as if it were placed in brilliant <lb/>
            light; and seeing every thing on all sides of him with a <lb/>
            perfect sight, and looking all around him, lie is found to be <lb/>
            armed, and protected, and fortified, so that no part of his <lb/>
            soul is ever found naked or in an unseemly plight, on ac­ <lb/>
            count of any accidents which occur unfortunately.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " And Noah <lb/>
            became sober after the wine ? "†</p>
          <p>73. The literal meaning is too notorious. Therefore we <lb/>
            need only here speak of what concerns the inner sense of <lb/>
            the words. When the intellect is strengthened, it is able <lb/>
            by its soberness to discern with a certain accuracy all <lb/>
            things, both before and behind it, both present, I mean, and <lb/>
            future; but the man who can see neither what is present <lb/>
            nor what is future with accuracy, is afflicted by blindness; <lb/>
            but he who sees the present, but who cannot also foresee <lb/>
            the future, and is not at all cautious, such a man is over­ <lb/>
            come by drunkenness and intoxication ; and he, lastly, who is <lb/>
            found to be able to look all around him, and to see, and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 23. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis ix. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="401"/>
            discern, and comprehend the different natures of things, <lb/>
            both present and future, the watchfulness of sobriety is in <lb/>
            that man.</p>
          <p>Why is it that after the sacred historian has enumerated <lb/>
            Ham in the middle of the offspring of Noah, or has placed <lb/>
            him in the middle between his brethren, he nevertheless <lb/>
            points out that he was the younger, saying, " Noah saw <lb/>
            what his younger son had done to him ? ” *</p>
          <p>74. This is a manifest allegory, because he here takes as <lb/>
            the younger, not him who was so in age and in point of <lb/>
            time, but him who was younger in mind; since wickedness <lb/>
            is unable to attain to a perception of the learning which is <lb/>
            proper to the elder; but the elder thoughts belong to a will <lb/>
            which is truly growing old, not indeed in body, but in mind.</p>
          <p>Why did Noah when praying for Shem speak thus: <lb/>
            " Blessed is the Lord God, the God of Shem: and Canaan <lb/>
            shall be his servant ?" t</p>
          <p>75. The names Lord and God are here used together on <lb/>
            account of his principal attributes, both of benevolence and <lb/>
            of kingly power by which the world was created; for as king <lb/>
            he created the world according to his beneficence; but after <lb/>
            he had completed it then the world was arranged and set in <lb/>
            order by his attribute of kingly power. Therefore he at <lb/>
            that time rendered the wise man worthy of a common <lb/>
            honour, which the whole world also received, all the parts of <lb/>
            the world being formed in an admirable manner with the <lb/>
            attributes of the Lord and God, doing so by his especial <lb/>
            prerogative, munificently pouring forth the favour and <lb/>
            liberality of his beneficent power.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that the beneficent power of <lb/>
            God is mentioned twice. Once, as has been already stated, <lb/>
            being placed in opposition to his kingly power; and a <lb/>
            second time without any such connexion, in order, forsooth, <lb/>
            that the wise man having been rendered worthy of his gifts, <lb/>
            both such as are common to him with others and such as <lb/>
            are peculiar to himself, he might also be rendered acceptable <lb/>
            both to the world and to God; to the world on account of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 25. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis ix. 28 </note> <note type="footnote"> TOL. IV. </note><note type="footnote">D D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            the excellence imparted to him in common with it, and to <lb/>
            God for such as was peculiar to himself.</p>
          <p>Why, when Noah prayed for Japhet, did he say, " God <lb/>
            shall enlarge Japhet, and bid him to dwell in the house of <lb/>
            Shem : and Canaan shall be their servant ? " *</p>
          <p>76. Without examining the literal statement, for the <lb/>
            meaning of that is plain, we had better approach the inner <lb/>
            sense contained in it, and examine that, in which the <lb/>
            second and third blessings mentioned are capable of an <lb/>
            enlarged and ample extension. As, for instance, good health, <lb/>
            and a vigorous state of the outward senses, and beauty, and <lb/>
            strength, and opulence, and nobleness of birth, and friends, <lb/>
            and the power of a prince, and numbers of other things. <lb/>
            And on this account he said, " God shall enlarge," &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Because taken separately, the abundant possession of <lb/>
            such numerous and great blessings has of itself been <lb/>
            injurious to many persons who have scarcely dwelt with <lb/>
            justice, or wisdom, or any other virtues, the complete pos­ <lb/>
            session of which dispenses to man-in an admirable manner the <lb/>
            advantages which are external to and which surround the <lb/>
            body; but the deprivation or absence of them leaves him <lb/>
            without the enjoyment or use of them; and man, if deprived <lb/>
            of all good protectors, and of the use of these enjoyments, is <lb/>
            exposed to as much suffering as he is capable of. Therefore <lb/>
            he prays on behalf of the man who has those things which <lb/>
            are around and exterior to the body, that he may dwell in <lb/>
            the house of the wise man ; so that attending to the rules of <lb/>
            all good men he may see and regulate his own course by <lb/>
            their example.</p>
          <p>Why because Ham bad sinned did God pronounce that <lb/>
            his son Canaan should be the servant of Ham and Japhet ? t</p>
          <p>77. In the first place, God pronounced this sentenc3 <lb/>
            because both father and son had displayed the same wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, being both united together and not separated, and <lb/>
            both indulging in the same disposition.</p>
          <p>But in the second place, he did so because the father <lb/>
            would be exceedingly afflicted at the curse thus laid upon <lb/>
            the son, being sufficiently conscious that he was punished <note type="footnote"> * Genesis is. 27. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            not so much for his own sake as for that of his father. And <lb/>
            so the leader and master of the two suffered the punishment <lb/>
            of his wicked counsels, and words, and actions.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of the statement. But if we <lb/>
            look to its inward meaning, then in reality they are no more <lb/>
            two different men than two different dispositions. And <lb/>
            this is made plain by the names given to them, which <lb/>
            manifestly denote the nature of the facts; for Ham being <lb/>
            interpreted means heat or hot; and Canaan means mer­ <lb/>
            chants or causes.</p>
          <p>Why was it that Noah lived after the deluge three <lb/>
            hundred and fifty years ? *</p>
          <p>78. It is now declared that in two periods of seven years <lb/>
            the form of the world was originally created and now <lb/>
            renewed under Noah. But the wise man lives for a period <lb/>
            of fourteen quarters of a century; and fourteen times <lb/>
            twenty-five is equal to seven times fifty, or fifty times <lb/>
            seven. And it is the principle of the seventh year and also <lb/>
            of the fiftieth, which has an especial order of its own <lb/>
            explained and ordained in Leviticus.</p>
          <p>Why among the three sons of Noah does Ham appear <lb/>
            always to occupy the middle place, but the two extremities <lb/>
            are varied ; for when their birth is mentioned, Shem is <lb/>
            placed in the first rank, in this manner, Shem, Ham, and <lb/>
            Japhet ; but when they are spoken of as fathers, then <lb/>
            Japhet is mentioned first, and the beginning of the enume­ <lb/>
            ration of the nation is derived from Japhet himself? t</p>
          <p>79. Those who inquire into the literal nature of the <lb/>
            divine writings think thus of the order in which these men <lb/>
            are mentioned, looking upon him who is the first named, <lb/>
            that is Shem, as the younger; and upon him who is named <lb/>
            the last, that is Japhet, as the elder. However they may <lb/>
            choose to think of this let them, being guided by the <lb/>
            principle of mere opinion. But we who look to the real <lb/>
            meaning of these statements think that there is here a <lb/>
            reference to the three things, good, bad, and indifferent; <lb/>
            which last are called secondary goods; and we must there­ <lb/>
            fore think that the sacred writer always puts the bad in the <note type="footnote"> Genesis ix. 28. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis x. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> D D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            middle, so that being confined at either extremity it may be <lb/>
            subdued on one side by the one, and on the other side by <lb/>
            the other; so that, being confined, it may be kept in and <lb/>
            subdued.</p>
          <p>But the good and the indifferent, or secondary good, <lb/>
            change the order with one another; for when there is such <lb/>
            great evil present, and yet not wholly and altogether, the <lb/>
            good rejoices in the first place, having the position of the <lb/>
            dispenser and chief of the whole. But when it is placed in <lb/>
            the position of the will in a state of conspiracy, and injustice <lb/>
            remains not only in the intellect but is also conducted to its <lb/>
            end by unjust works, then that first good is changed from <lb/>
            its original order into another place, together with all the <lb/>
            good habits which depend upon it, rejecting all education <lb/>
            and all arrangement, as being wholly unable to attain its <lb/>
            proposed end, just as a physician does when he sees an in­ <lb/>
            curable disease.</p>
          <p>But the elder good manages that virtue which is around <lb/>
            the body and exterior to it; therefore, by observing the <lb/>
            extremities with greater caution, and closing in the beast <lb/>
            within its toils, it is sufficiently demonstrated that it does <lb/>
            not dare to bite or injure any more. But while it feels that <lb/>
            it has done no injury, it is transferred into a more secure <lb/>
            and more permanent position, and then, a higher and better <lb/>
            fortified place being assigned to it, it easily retains the lower <lb/>
            position too as one easy to be preserved; for, in con­ <lb/>
            sequence of the superior power of its guardian, it is always <lb/>
            practicable to watch it closely, since nothing is more mighty <lb/>
            than virtue.</p>
          <p>Why do the people of Ceos, and of Rhodes, and the isles <lb/>
            of the Gentiles, spring from Japhet ?*</p>
          <p>So. Since he has the name denoting breadth (namely <lb/>
            Japhet), being expanded in his growth and increase, <lb/>
            that part of the things of the world which have been <lb/>
            assigned by nature for the use of mankind, that is to say, <lb/>
            the earth, can no longer hold him, therefore he passes over <lb/>
            into the other part, that is to say, the sea and the islands <lb/>
            belonging to it.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of the statement. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 4. </note> <pb n="405"/>
            </p>
          <p>But if we look to its inner sense, all the external bless­ <lb/>
            ings which are bestowed by nature, such as riches, and <lb/>
            honour, and principalities, are lavished and poured forth in <lb/>
            every direction on those men into whose hands they come, <lb/>
            and are also extended widely to others who are not so much <lb/>
            within reach; so that in a greater, or at all events, in no less a <lb/>
            degree do they surround and hem the man in, in accordance <lb/>
            with the greediness of the lovers of riches and glory, since <lb/>
            they are eager for principalities, and are never satisfied be­ <lb/>
            cause of their insatiable desires.</p>
          <p>Why the eldest son of Ham is Chus.*</p>
          <p>81. The sacred historian has here produced a word most <lb/>
            completely in accordance with nature, saying that Chus was <lb/>
            the elder son of evil, Chus being the dissolved and loose <lb/>
            nature of the earth, for the earth, when dense and fertile, <lb/>
            and moist, is full of herbs, and hills, and trees, and is well <lb/>
            arranged for the production of different fruits; but when <lb/>
            dissolved and reduced to dust and dry, it is unfruitful and <lb/>
            barren ; and besides it is tossed about in the air, when it is <lb/>
            raised from the ground by the wind, by its dust making <lb/>
            the air all alive.</p>
          <p>Such as this is the first origin and the first shoots of evil <lb/>
            being destitute of the generation of good pursuits, and the <lb/>
            cause of barrenness to the soul and to all its parts.</p>
          <p>Why was Chus the father of Nimrod, who began to be a <lb/>
            giant and a hunter before the Lord: on which account they <lb/>
            said, " Like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord ? "t</p>
          <p>The father in this case, having a nature truly dissolute, <lb/>
            does not at all keep fast the spiritual bond of the soul, nor <lb/>
            of nature, nor of consistency of manners, but rather like a <lb/>
            giant born of the earth, prefers earthly to heavenly things, <lb/>
            and thus appears to verity the ancient fable of the giants <lb/>
            and Titans ; for in truth he who is an emulator of earthly <lb/>
            and corruptible things is always engaged in a conflict with <lb/>
            heavenly and admirable natures, raising up earth as a bul­ <lb/>
            wark against heaven ; and those things which are below are <lb/>
            adverse to those which are above.</p>
          <p>On which account there is much propriety in the expres­ <lb/>
            sion, he was a giant against God, which thus declares the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis x. 6. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis x. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            opposition of such beings to the deity ; for a wicked man is <lb/>
            nothing else than an enemy, contending against God: on <lb/>
            which account it has become a proverb that every one who <lb/>
            sins greatly ought to be referred to him as the original and <lb/>
            chief of sinners, being spoken of " as a second Nimrod."</p>
          <p>Therefore his very name is an indication of his character, for <lb/>
            it is interpreted Æthiopian, and his art is that of hunting, <lb/>
            both of which things are detestable : an Æthiopian because <lb/>
            unmitigated wickedness has no participation in light, but <lb/>
            imitates night and darkness : and the practice of the hunts­ <lb/>
            man is as much as possible at variance with rational nature, <lb/>
            for he who lives among wild beasts wishes to live the life of <lb/>
            a beast, and to be equal to the brutes in the vices of wicked­ <lb/>
            ness.</p>

          <p>WHAT is the meaning of the expression, "I am the Lord <lb/>
            thy God who brought thee out of the land of the Chaldæans <lb/>
            to give thee this land for an inheritance ? " *</p>
          <p>1. As the literal statement is plain enough, we need only <lb/>
            consider the inner meaning, which was meant to be inter­ <lb/>
            preted in this manner.</p>
          <p>The law of the Chaldæans taken symbolically is mathema­ <lb/>
            tical speculation, one part of which is recognised to be <lb/>
            astronomy, which the Chaldæans study with great industry <lb/>
            and with great success. Therefore God is here honouring <lb/>
            the wise man with a gift; in the first place, by taking men <lb/>
            out of the sect of the astrologers, that is to say, away from <lb/>
            the hallucinations of the Chaldseans, which, as they are diffi: <lb/>
            cult to detect and refute, are found to be the cause of great <lb/>
            evils and wickedness, since they ascribe the attributes of the <lb/>
            Creator to created things, and persuade men to worship and <lb/>
            to venerate the works of the world as God.</p>
          <p>In the second place, God honours him by granting to him <lb/>
            the wisdom which bears fruit, which he has here symboli­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            cally called the earth ; but the Father of the universe shows <lb/>
            that wisdom and virtue are invariable and immutable, since <lb/>
            it is not consistent with his character that God should show <lb/>
            to any one that which can undergo any variation or change, <lb/>
            for that which is shown by the being who is immutable and <lb/>
            consistent must be so too; but that which is liable to <lb/>
            change, as being incessantly in the habit of suffering varia­ <lb/>
            tion, admits of no proper or divine demonstration.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, " Lord, by what shall I know that I <lb/>
            shall inherit it ? " *</p>
          <p>2. He here is seeking a sign for a ratification of the <lb/>
            promise ; but two things only are described deserving of <lb/>
            study ; one that which is an affection of the mind, namely, <lb/>
            the belief in God according to his literal word; the other <lb/>
            a being borne on with the most exceeding desire not to be <lb/>
            left in want of some signs, by which the hearer may feel, to <lb/>
            the conviction of his outer senses, a confirmation of the <lb/>
            promise : and to him who has given the promise he offers <lb/>
            worthy veneration by the appellation, " Lord."</p>
          <p>For by this title he says, I know thee to be the Lord and <lb/>
            prince of all things, who art also able to do all things, and <lb/>
            there is no disability with thee. But in truth, if I have <lb/>
            already given credence to thy promise, still I nevertheless <lb/>
            wish to obtain speedily if not a completion of it, yet at all <lb/>
            events some evident signs by which its consummation may <lb/>
            be indicated ; in truth I am thy creature, and even if I were <lb/>
            to arrive at the highest degree of excellence, I am not <lb/>
            always able to restrain the violence of my desire, so as not, <lb/>
            when I have seen or heard anything good, to be contented <lb/>
            with obtaining it slowly and not immediately; therefore I <lb/>
            entreat that thou wilt give me some means of knowledge, <lb/>
            by which I may comprehend those future events.</p>
          <p>Why is it that he says, " Take for me a heifer of three years <lb/>
            old, and a goat of three years old, and a raven of three years <lb/>
            old, and a turtle dove and a pigeon ? " t</p>
          <p>3. He here mentions five animals, which are offered on the <lb/>
            sacred altar; for these are divided into classes of victims, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 8. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xv. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            three kinds of terrestrial animals, the ox, the goat, and the <lb/>
            sheep; and two kinds of birds, the turtle dove and the <lb/>
            pigeon; for the sacred writer constantly tells us that the <lb/>
            everlasting reverence of victims derived its origin from the <lb/>
            patriarch, who was also the origin of the race : but instead <lb/>
            of the expression, " Bring to me," he has very admirably used <lb/>
            the words, " Take for me; " since there is nothing especi­ <lb/>
            ally and peculiarly belonging to the creature, but everything <lb/>
            is the gift of and blessing bestowed by God, who is altoge­ <lb/>
            ther willing that when any one has received anything he <lb/>
            should offer thanks for it with all his heart.</p>
          <p>But he orders him to take every animal at the age of <lb/>
            three years ; since three is a full and perfect number, con­ <lb/>
            sisting of a beginning, a middle, and an end; but still we <lb/>
            may raise the question, why of these three animals, he takes <lb/>
            two females, the heifer, and the she-goat, and one male, the <lb/>
            ram; may it not be perhaps because the heifer and the she- <lb/>
            goat are offered as an atonement for sin; but the sheep is <lb/>
            not, as sin arises from frailty, and the female is frail ?</p>
          <p>This much I have thought fit to say with especial appo­ <lb/>
            siteness to this question; but I am not however ignorant <lb/>
            that all things of this kind offer a handle to those who wish <lb/>
            to cavil, to disparage the sacred scriptures; therefore in this <lb/>
            instance they say that there is nothing here described and <lb/>
            indicated but a command to sacrifice, by the division of the <lb/>
            animals and an examination of their entrails ; and what is <lb/>
            visible in them they affirm to be an indication of what is <lb/>
            convenient, and of the similitude which arises from things <lb/>
            visible.</p>
          <p>But those men, as it appears to me, are of that class <lb/>
            which forms a part alone from a judgment of the whole, but <lb/>
            which on the contrary does not from a judgment of a part <lb/>
            form the whole, which last is the better way of coming to an <lb/>
            opinion, as being that by which both the name and the fact <lb/>
            are altogether established.</p>
          <p>Therefore the giving of the Jaw, that is to say the sacred <lb/>
            scriptures, that I may so express myself, is a sort of living <lb/>
            unity, the whole of which one ought to examine carefully <lb/>
            with all one's eyes, and so discern with truth, and certainty, <lb/>
            and clearness, the universal intention of the whole of the <lb/>
            scripture without dissecting or lacerating its harmony, <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            or disuniting its unity; by any other mode everything <lb/>
            would appear utterly inconsistent and absurd, being disso­ <lb/>
            ciated from all community or equity.</p>
          <p>What then is the intention of the delivery of the law as <lb/>
            exhibited to us ? It is scientific, and so is everything <lb/>
            which describes scientific species ; since the offering of <lb/>
            sacrifice and all science admits of a consistent usage, and of <lb/>
            expressions well adapted to them, and of various opinions, <lb/>
            by which not only the footsteps of truth are occupied, but <lb/>
            sometimes are even darkened, as affection is by flattery; but <lb/>
            in such way that the very things which are genuine and <lb/>
            established by experiment are perverted by things which <lb/>
            are both inconsistent and unproved.</p>
          <p>And the natures of the animals above mentioned have an <lb/>
            intimate connection with the parts of the universe; the ox <lb/>
            is connected with the earth, as being an animal employed in <lb/>
            drawing the plough and in tilling the earth; the goat again <lb/>
            is connected with the water (it is called in Greek and Arme­ <lb/>
            nian <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀἴξ</foreign>, or ajx), being an animal deriving its name from <lb/>
            driving and rushing on (from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄγω</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀΐσσω</foreign>) ; since water <lb/>
            is an impetuous thing, and the course of rivers, and the <lb/>
            extent of the breadth of the sea, and the sea itself agitated <lb/>
            as it is by its ebb and flow, are witnesses of the propriety of <lb/>
            the name and of the closeness of the connection.</p>
          <p>And the ram (aries) is connected with the air, as being a <lb/>
            very violent and vivacious animal, on which account too the <lb/>
            ram is more useful to mankind than any other animal as <lb/>
            affording them raiment.</p>
          <p>Therefore, on account of these reasons, as I think, God <lb/>
            orders him first to take these two female animals, the cow <lb/>
            and the she-goat; since both these elements, earth and water, <lb/>
            are material, and for the most part feminine. But the third he <lb/>
            will have a male, namely the ram; becaues the air or wind <lb/>
            has been explained as masculine; since the natures of all <lb/>
            things are divided into bodies or into earth and water, and <lb/>
            female animals exist by nature. But that which exhibits a <lb/>
            similitude to the soul is arranged under the head of air and <lb/>
            the breath of life. And this, as I have said, is masculine. <lb/>
            If therefore we arc to call that masculine which is the moving <lb/>
            and active cause we must call that feminine which is moved <lb/>
            and passive.</p><pb n="410"/>
            
          <p>But the whole heaven is found to be familiarly connected <lb/>
            with flying birds such as the pigeon and turtle dove, being <lb/>
            distributed as it is into the rotatory path of the planets and <lb/>
            fixed stars.</p>
          <p>Therefore he dedicates the pigeon to the planets, for that <lb/>
            is a tame and domestic animal, as also the planets are more <lb/>
            familiarly connected with us as being nearer to the earth, <lb/>
            and as having sympathies with us; but he consecrates the <lb/>
            turtle dove to the fixed stars, for that animal is a lover of <lb/>
            solitude, and flees from the conversation of the multitude, <lb/>
            and from all connection of every kind. And so also the <lb/>
            globe itself is remote, and a thing which wanders into the <lb/>
            furthest extremities of the world.</p>
          <p>Therefore both the species of these two birds are assimi­ <lb/>
            lated to the divine attributes, since as Plato, the disciple of <lb/>
            Socrates, says it is fitting that the heaven should have a swift <lb/>
            chariot by reason of its very swift rotatory motion, which in <lb/>
            fact surpasses even the birds themselves in the velocity of <lb/>
            their course. But the birds above mentioned are singers; <lb/>
            the prophet indicating by an enigmatical expression that <lb/>
            perfect music which exists in heaven harmoniously adapted <lb/>
            from the motion of the stars, since it is a proof of human <lb/>
            art when the corresponding music of the voices of animals <lb/>
            and of living instruments is adapted together by the industry <lb/>
            of genius. But this heavenly music has been abundantly <lb/>
            extended over the earth by the Creator, as he has also <lb/>
            extended the rays of the sun, being always prompt to exer­ <lb/>
            cise his beneficent care for the human race.</p>
          <p>For such music excites frenzy in the ears, and brings un­ <lb/>
            restrained pleasure to the mind; and so causes men to <lb/>
            forget even their meat and drink, and even when hunger <lb/>
            brings death to the door to be willing even to die out of a <lb/>
            desire to hear music.</p>
          <p>And if the song of the Sirens, * as Homer tells us, invites <lb/>
            the heavens so forcibly, that they forget while listening to <note type="footnote"> * He alludes here to the description in Homer:

          <p>But the reason on account of which every one of the <lb/>
            animals to be offered is to be three years of age has already <lb/>
            been explained ; and we must now discuss it under another <lb/>
            form of mystery, since it has been seen that every one of those <lb/>
            things which were called into existence and subsequently to <lb/>
            the moon, such as the earth, water, and air, rejoice in an order <lb/>
            connected with the number three.</p>
          <p>In the divisions of earth there is a vast quantity of dry <lb/>
            continent, islands and peninsulas. Water is divided into sea, <lb/>
            rivers, and lakes; and the air into the two equinoxes, the <lb/>
            vernal and the autumnal; and they may be taken as one, for <lb/>
            they have an equal proportion of day and night, and accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the equinoxes are neither hot nor cold. Add to these the <lb/>
            changes of summer and winter, for the sun is borne through <lb/>
            those three circles into the seasons of summer, winter, and <lb/>
            the equinoxes. Therefore, in the first place, the natural <lb/>
            arrangement will be of this kind; and the moral arrange­ <lb/>
            ment is properly thus.</p>
          <p>In every one of us there are three things flesh, the outward <lb/>
            sense, and reason; therefore the calf exhibits a familiarity with <lb/>
            the corporeal substance, since our flesh is subdued by, and kept <lb/>
            in subservience to, and in connection with the ministrations <lb/>
            of life ; also their nature is female according to matter, being <lb/>
            calculated rather to be passive and to be subject rather than <lb/>
            to be active.</p>
          <p>But the similitude of the she-goat isconnectedwith the com­ <lb/>
            munion of the outward senses, either because all the objects <lb/>
            of those outward senses are each borne towards their ap­ <lb/>
            propriate sensation, or because each impulse and motion of <lb/>
            the soul takes place in consequence of an imagination <lb/>
            formed of the objects received through the medium of the <lb/>
            external senses. And this is followed, in the first place, by a <lb/>
            certain inflexion or alienation, which by some is called an <lb/>
            occasion, that is to say, an impulse affecting each kind of <lb/>
            sense. But since the female is the outward sense, as being <lb/>
            passive in consequence of what is subjected to the outward <lb/>
            senses, therefore God has adapted to it a female animal, the <lb/>
            she-goat.</p>
          <p>But the ram is akin to the word, or to reason. In the <lb/>
            first place, because it is a male animal; secondly, because it <lb/>
            is a working animal; and thirdly, because it is the cause of <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            the world, and of the firmament; that is to say, the ram is <lb/>
            so by means of the clothing which it supplies; and reason, <lb/>
            or the word, is so in the arrangement of life; for whatever <lb/>
            is not irregular and absurd immediately exhibits reason. <lb/>
            And there are two species of reason ; the one derived from <lb/>
            that nature by which the affairs of the world subjected to <lb/>
            the outward senses are finished; the other from that of those <lb/>
            things which are called incorporeal species, by which the <lb/>
            affairs of that world which is the object of the intellect are <lb/>
            brought to their accomplishment. Therefore the pigeon <lb/>
            and the turtle dove are found to resemble these.</p>
          <p>The pigeon, forsooth, resembles speculation in natural phi­ <lb/>
            losophy ; for it is a more familiar bird, as the objects of the <lb/>
            outward sense are exceedingly familiar to the sight: and the <lb/>
            soul of the inquirer into natural science flies upward as if it <lb/>
            were furnished with wings ; and being borne aloft is carried <lb/>
            round the heaven, discerning every part of everything,and the <lb/>
            principles of every separate thing; for the turtle dove imitates <lb/>
            that species which is the subject of intellect and incorporeal; <lb/>
            for as that animal is fond of solitude, so it is superior to the <lb/>
            violent species which come under the outward sense, associat­ <lb/>
            ing itself as it does with the invisible species by its essence.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, "And he took unto him all these <lb/>
            things ? " *</p>
          <p>4. He has added also that expression, " And he took unto <lb/>
            him," with especial propriety; for it is the sign of a soul <lb/>
            thoroughly imbued with the love of God to ascribe whatever <lb/>
            good and noble theories and feelings it receives, not unto <lb/>
            itself, but wholly to God who is the giver of all benefits.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " He divided them in the middle <lb/>
            and laid the pieces opposite to one another ? " t</p>
          <p>5. Also the whole structure of the body, as of flesh, is to <lb/>
            be looked at in such a light as this according to its whole <lb/>
            creation; for the parts are brothers ; not as they are divided <lb/>
            and placed opposite to one another; but, being naturally <lb/>
            inclined to one another, and having a mutual regard to one <lb/>
            another, on account of their natural co-operation; the <lb/>
            original Creator who gave them life making this division for <note type="footnote"> Genesis xv. 10. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            the sake of usefulness, so that one part should be opposed to <lb/>
            the other part, and again that both should reciprocally seek <lb/>
            one another in all necessary ministrations.</p>
          <p>In this way he has directly separated the sense of sight, <lb/>
            distributing it equally to two eyes by placing the nose <lb/>
            between them and thus turning each eye to the other; for the <lb/>
            pupils, if I may so say, lean both in one direction so as <lb/>
            mutually to behold the same thing, scarcely ever straying <lb/>
            beyond the position in which they are placed, but only <lb/>
            looking towards one another, especially when anything <lb/>
            comes across their sight.</p>
          <p>And in similar manner the faculty of hearing is distributed <lb/>
            between the two ears, which are both reciprocally turned to <lb/>
            one another, both tending to one and the same operation. <lb/>
            And the sense of smell is divided between the two nostrils, <lb/>
            being turned towards the two tubes ofthe nostrils, which are not <lb/>
            revolving around or inclined towards the cheeks, so as being <lb/>
            drawn in two different directions to look the one towards the <lb/>
            right and the other towards the left, but being both collected <lb/>
            together and turned inwards they await all smells with a <lb/>
            common action.</p>
          <p>So also the hands are not made of an appearance contrary to <lb/>
            that of one another, but being like brothers and like divisible <lb/>
            parts, looking to one another mutually, and being prepared by <lb/>
            nature for an operation and employment suitable to them, <lb/>
            they thus act in the operations of receiving, giving, and <lb/>
            working. And the feet are not constituted differently from <lb/>
            the hands ; as each of them behaves in such a manner that <lb/>
            they both yield the one to the other, and progress is effected <lb/>
            by the motion of both together, so that nothing can be <lb/>
            accomplished by one alone. Nor is it only the feet and <lb/>
            shins, but also the legs and knee-pans, and hips, and the <lb/>
            breasts, and in fact every part on the right or left of the <lb/>
            body, being divided in a similar manner, indicate one gene­ <lb/>
            ral harmony and correspondence and union as it were of <lb/>
            connatural parts; that is to say, of all of those different <lb/>
            members enumerated according to their separate species.</p>
          <p>And generally, whoever considers together and in an equal <lb/>
            manner all the above mentioned parts thus subdivided, in <lb/>
            reference to their joint operation, will find one nature com­ <lb/>
            bined of the two parts. As the hands, united and connected <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            together with the fingers, are seen when in union with them to <lb/>
            exhibit a harmony; and the feet, when re-united in operation, <lb/>
            are seentotendto union; and the ears, when similarly combined <lb/>
            in the figure of an amphitheatre, are seen to unite themselves, <lb/>
            in effect extending across the space which separates them.</p>
          <p>Therefore our nature, continually making in this manner a <lb/>
            division of those parts which exist in us according to each <lb/>
            separate species, has first of all separated and arranged the <lb/>
            different sections, placing them as it were opposite to one ano­ <lb/>
            ther in the same way in which it has arranged the world ; <lb/>
            and it has also arranged them with reference to the easy dis­ <lb/>
            charge of their several duties. And again it has combined each <lb/>
            of these members according to each species into one action, <lb/>
            and into the same operation, collecting together all of them <lb/>
            when considered generally.</p>
          <p>Nor is it only the parts of the body which any one may <lb/>
            see thus united and in pairs, separated in their union, and <lb/>
            again united in their division, but the parts of the soul are <lb/>
            so too. But since the two superior sections of this are so <lb/>
            many separate classes, namely the rational and the irrational, <lb/>
            so also the separate parts of each section have their own <lb/>
            appropriate division; as for instance, the rational part is <lb/>
            divided into the intention and into the uttered word; and <lb/>
            that part which exists in accordance with the outward <lb/>
            senses is divided into the four senses; for the fifth sense, <lb/>
            touch, is common to the other four, two of which, those with <lb/>
            which we see and hear, are philosophical senses, so that it is by <lb/>
            means of them that the power of living well is acquired for <lb/>
            us ; the others are non-philosophical, namely smell and taste, <lb/>
            but are servile, being created only for living; for the sense <lb/>
            of smell, by means of its exercise, contains many things <lb/>
            which awaken it, and receives a continual breathing which <lb/>
            is as it were the continual food of living creatures; there­ <lb/>
            fore smell and taste support this mortal body, but sight and <lb/>
            hearing afford service to the immortal soul.</p>
          <p>Therefore these divisions of our members, according to our <lb/>
            body and soul, were made and separated by the Creator; <lb/>
            however, we must know that the parts of the world also are <lb/>
            arranged in two divisions and are placed opposite to one <lb/>
            another; the earth being divided into mountainous and <lb/>
            champaign districts; the water into sweet and salt, sweet <lb/>
             <pb n="416"/>
            being that which is supplied by springs and rivers, and salt <lb/>
            being that which comes from the sea; as also the atmo­ <lb/>
            sphere is divided into summer and winter, and also into <lb/>
            spring and autumn.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that Heraclitus wrote his books <lb/>
            about nature, having borrowed his theory of contraries from <lb/>
            our sacred historian, with the addition of an infinite number <lb/>
            of laborious arguments.</p>
          <p>Why is it said, " But he did not divide the birds ?" *</p>
          <p>6. He is shadowing forth a fifth and periodical nature, <lb/>
            from which the ancients say that the heaven was made; for <lb/>
            the four elements are mixtures rather than elements: by <lb/>
            which he subdivides those things which are already divided <lb/>
            into those materials of which they were originally composed, <lb/>
            as the earth includes within itself a portion of the elements <lb/>
            of water, and also of air, and also of fire, which however <lb/>
            obtains the appellation not so much in accordance with our <lb/>
            apprehension of it, as with our sight; and again the water <lb/>
            is not so clear or pure, as not to have some participation in <lb/>
            wind and earth; and so also in each of the other elements <lb/>
            there is a certain tempering and combination; but the fifth <lb/>
            substance is the only one which has been made unmixed <lb/>
            and pure, on which account it was not accustomed to be <lb/>
            mentioned at all.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is well said, he did not divide the birds; <lb/>
            since the heavenly nature, both of the planets and also of <lb/>
            the fixed stars, is raised on high like that of birds; in the <lb/>
            similitude of both kinds, that is to say, of clean birds, the <lb/>
            turtle dove and the pigeon, which scarcely admit of being <lb/>
            divided or cut up; for the indivisible nature is of a fifth <lb/>
            essence, more unmixed and pure than the others, and there­ <lb/>
            fore it more closely resembles unity.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " And the birds descended on the <lb/>
            bodies which were divided ?"</p>
          <p>7. Since the three animals, the heifer, and the she-goat, <lb/>
            and the ram, were divided in a symbolical manner, they are <lb/>
            signs, as we have already said, of the earth, and water, and <lb/>
            air; still it is necessary to give now a reason for this ex­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 10. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xv. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            amining the truth carefully under the mystery of a simili­ <lb/>
            tude.</p>
          <p>Perhaps therefore he designs and intimates by the de­ <lb/>
            scent of the birds on the cut pieces an invasion of ene­ <lb/>
            mies ; for all the nature of the world beneath the moon is <lb/>
            full of battles and ill will, both domestic and external; and <lb/>
            the birds in truth appear to fly down on the divided bodies <lb/>
            for the sake of meat and drink ; naturally indeed it is the <lb/>
            stronger which descend upon the weaker animals, as upon <lb/>
            dead bodies, attacking them in general unexpectedly, but <lb/>
            they do not By down on the turtle dove and pigeon, since <lb/>
            the heavenly bodies are free from desires and unconscious <lb/>
            of suffering wrong.</p>
          <p>Why is it that he says, " Abraham passed over and sat <lb/>
            upon them ?”*</p>
          <p>8. Those who think that sacrifice is indicated by the <lb/>
            matters about which we are at present speaking will say <lb/>
            that the virtuous man, sitting as it were in a synagogue, has <lb/>
            examined into the entrails of the divided animals, as if that <lb/>
            were looked upon as an unerring symbol for the declaration <lb/>
            of the truth; but we, who adhere to Moses and who are <lb/>
            thoroughly acquainted with the views of that teacher, one <lb/>
            who, turning away his face from every sophistical appearance <lb/>
            and prognostic, trusted in God alone, will rather say, that <lb/>
            he has here introduced the just man who is endued with <lb/>
            virtue with the birds themselves, who were congregated <lb/>
            together and flying about over him, intending to denote <lb/>
            nothing else by this parabolical presentation, but that he is <lb/>
            desirous of hindering injustice and covetousness, and is <lb/>
            most hostile to quarrels and wars, and a lover of consistency <lb/>
            and peace ; for he himself is truly a guardian of peace.</p>
          <p>Since no one state has ever rested in tranquillity owing to <lb/>
            the conduct of the wicked, but kingdoms have become fixed <lb/>
            steadily when one or two men endued with virtue have <lb/>
            arisen, whose virtue has put an end to civil disturbances, <lb/>
            God granting to those who are earnest in the pursuit of <lb/>
            virtue good habits calculated to procure them honour; <lb/>
            and not to them only, but to those also who approach near <lb/>
            to the production of general advantage. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IT. </note> <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <pb n="418"/>
            </p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the words, " About the time of <lb/>
            the setting of the sun a trance fell upon Abraham; and lo, <lb/>
            a great horror of darkness came over him ? "*</p>
          <p>9. A certain divine excess was suddenly rendered calm to <lb/>
            the man endued with virtue; for the trance, or ecstacy as <lb/>
            the word itself evidently points out, is nothing else than a <lb/>
            departure of the mind wandering beyond itself, f</p>
          <p>But the class of prophets loves to be subject to such <lb/>
            influences; for when it is divining, and when the intellect is <lb/>
            inspired with divine things, it no longer exists in itself, <lb/>
            since it receives the divine spirit within and permits it to <lb/>
            dwell with itself; or rather, as he himself has expressed it, a <lb/>
            spirit falls upon him; since it does not come slowly over <lb/>
            him, but rushes down upon him suddenly.</p>
          <p>Moreover, that which he has added afterwards applies <lb/>
            admirably, that a great horror of darkness fell upon him. <lb/>
            For all these things are ecstacies of the mind ; for he also <lb/>
            who is in a state of alarm is not in himself; but darkness is <lb/>
            a hindrance to his sight; and in proportion as the horror is <lb/>
            greater, so also do his powers of seeing and understanding <lb/>
            became more obscured.</p>
          <p>And this is not said without reason : but as an indication <lb/>
            of the evident knowledge of prophecy by which oracles and <lb/>
            laws are given from God.</p>
          <p>Why was it said to him, “ Thou shalt know to a certainty <lb/>
            that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, <lb/>
            and shall be reduced to slavery, and shall be grievously <lb/>
            afflicted for forty years ?”</p>
          <p>10. That expression is admirably used," It was said to <lb/>
            him," since a prophet is supposed to utter something, but <lb/>
            yet he is not pronouncing any command of his own, but is <lb/>
            only the interpreter of another who sends something into <lb/>
            his mind; and moreover whatever he does utter and deliver <lb/>
            in words is all true and divine. And in the first place, he <lb/>
            declares that a family of the human race is to dwell in a land <lb/>
            belonging to another; for all things which are beneath the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 12. </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἔκστασις</foreign>, derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξίσταμαι</foreign>, in 2nd Mor. act. <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξέστην</foreign>, "I was <lb/>

            heaven are the possession of God, and those living creatures <lb/>
            which exist on the earth may more properly and truly be said <lb/>
            to be sojourners in a foreign land than to be dwelling in a <lb/>
            country of their own which by nature they have not got.</p>
          <p>In the second place, he thus declares to us that every <lb/>
            mortal is a slave after his kind. But no man is found to be <lb/>
            free, but every one has many masters who vex and afflict him <lb/>
            both within and without; for instance, without there are <lb/>
            the winter which affects him with the cold, the summer which <lb/>
            scorches him with heat, and hunger, and thirst, and many <lb/>
            other calamities; and within there are pleasures and con­ <lb/>
            cupiscences, and sorrows, and fears. But his servitude is <lb/>
            limited to a period of four hundred years, during which the <lb/>
            aforesaid pleasures shall rise up against him. On which <lb/>
            account it has been said above, that Abraham passed over <lb/>
            and sat upon them, hindering and repelling them; as far as <lb/>
            the literal words go, repelling those carnivorous birds which <lb/>
            were hovering over the divided animals, but in fact repelling <lb/>
            the afflictions which come upon men. Since a man who is <lb/>
            in his own proper nature a lover of, and also by diligent <lb/>
            practice a studier of virtue, is a most humane physician of <lb/>
            our race, and a true protector of it, and guardian of it from <lb/>
            evil. For all these things have an allegorical reference to <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>For while the soul of the wise man, descending from above <lb/>
            from the sky, comes down upon and enters a mortal and is <lb/>
            sown in the field of the body, it is truly sojourning in a land <lb/>
            which is not his own. Since the earthly nature of the body <lb/>
            is wholly alien from pure intellect, and tends to subdue it <lb/>
            and to drag it downwards into slavery, bringing ev ery kind <lb/>
            of affliction upon it, until the sorrow, bringing the attractive <lb/>
            multitude of vices to judgment, condemns them ; and thus <lb/>
            at last the soul is restored to freedom. And it is on this <lb/>
            account that he subsequently adds the sentence, " Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less the nation which they shall send I will judge: and after­ <lb/>
            wards they shall go forth with great substance ;" namely, with <lb/>
            the same measure, and still better. Because then the mind is <lb/>
            released from its mischievous colleague, departing out of the <lb/>
            body and being transferred not only with freedom but <lb/>
            also with much substance; so as to leave nothing good or <lb/>
            useful behind to its enemies. <note type="footnote"> E E 2 </note></p><pb n="420"/>
            
          <p>Since every rational soul is productive, but he who thinks <lb/>
            himself loaded and endued with virtue in his own counsel, <lb/>
            is unable to preserve his fruit unto the end. For it becomes <lb/>
            a virtuous man to attain to the objects which he has intended <lb/>
            of his own accord, as also the counsels of wisdom correspond <lb/>
            to those objects. Since, as some trees, although they appear <lb/>
            productive at the first season of the budding of their fruits, <lb/>
            are yet unable to bring them to maturity, so that the whole <lb/>
            fruit before it becomes ripe is shaken off by every trifling <lb/>
            cause ; in the same manner the souls of inconstant men feel <lb/>
            many influences which contribute to their productiveness, <lb/>
            but nevertheless are unable to keep them sound till they <lb/>
            arrive at perfection, as a man studious of virtue ought to do <lb/>
            in order eventually to gather them as his own possessions.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " But thou shalt go to thy fathers <lb/>
            in peace, being nourished in a fair old age ? "*</p>
          <p>11. He here clearly indicates the incorruptibility of the <lb/>
            soul: when it transfers itself out of the abode of the mortal <lb/>
            body and returns as it were to the metropolis of its native <lb/>
            country, from which it originally emigrated into the body. <lb/>
            Since to say to a dead man, " Thou shalt go to thy fathers," <lb/>
            what else is this but to propose to him and set before him a <lb/>
            second existence apart from the body as far as it is proper <lb/>
            for the soul of the wise man to dwell by itself?</p>
          <p>But when he says this he does not mean by the fathers of <lb/>
            Abraham his father, and his grandfather, and his great-grand­ <lb/>
            fathers after the flesh, for they were not all deserving of <lb/>
            praise so as to be by any possibility any honour to him <lb/>
            who arrived at the succession of the same order, but he <lb/>
            appears by this expression to be assigning to him for his <lb/>
            fathers, according to the opinion of many commentators, all <lb/>
            the elements into which the mortal man when deceased is <lb/>
            resolved.</p>
          <p>But to me he appears to intend to indicate the incorporeal <lb/>
            substances and inhabiters of the divine world, whom in other <lb/>
            passages lie is accustomed to call angels. Moreover the <lb/>
            words which follow are not by any means without an object, <lb/>
            that he is nourished in peace and in a fair old age. For the <lb/>
            wicked and depraved man is nourished in battle, and lives <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="421"/>
            and departs in a very bad old age. But the good man, in <lb/>
            both phases of existence, both in that which is in connection <lb/>
            with the body and in that which is apart from the body, <lb/>
            cultivates peace, and is alone completely virtuous, such as <lb/>
            no foolish person is found to be, even though he should live <lb/>
            longer than an elephant; on which account he here carefully <lb/>
            said, " Thou shalt go to thy fathers, being nourished-not in <lb/>
            an advanced old age, but-in a fair old age." For many <lb/>
            foolish persons also have their lives extended to a greatly <lb/>
            lengthened period, but it is only the man who is desirous of <lb/>
            virtue who enjoys a good old age and one endued with virtue.</p>
          <p>Why is it that he says, “And in the fourth generation <lb/>
            they shall return again hither ?"*</p>
          <p>12. The number four is more fit than any other number, <lb/>
            for this reason, that as it is more perfect, and is the root and <lb/>
            foundation of the perfect number ten; and it is according <lb/>
            to the principle of the number four that all collected are to <lb/>
            return hither, as he himself has said. But as he by himself <lb/>
            is perfect, so also those of whom he is the father are <lb/>
            evidently perfect.</p>
          <p>But what is it that I am saying ? In the generation of <lb/>
            animals the sowing of the seed has the first place; in the <lb/>
            second place, comes the fact of each instrument being, in <lb/>
            some manner, impressed by something akin to nature; <lb/>
            thirdly, there is the growth after the first formation of the <lb/>
            creature; fourthly, after everything else comes the perfec­ <lb/>
            tion, that is to say, the birth. And the same principle and <lb/>
            order prevail in plants; the seed is cast into the earth, <lb/>
            then it pushes its way both upwards and downwards, partly <lb/>
            in roots and partly in branches; after that it increases ; and <lb/>
            fourthly, it produces fruit; and in the same manner again <lb/>
            the trees, when made, first of all produce fruit, which sub­ <lb/>
            sequently grows; then, as it becomes ripe, it changes colour; <lb/>
            and, fourthly, and this is the last operation, it completes and <lb/>
            perfects its work, the consequence of which is the use and <lb/>
            enjoyment of it by men.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " For the sins of the Amorites <lb/>
            were not as yet completed ?”† <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 16 </note><note type="footnote">† Ibid. </note></p><pb n="422"/>
            
          <p>13. Some persons have said, that by this expression of <lb/>
            the principle of Moses fate is expressly introduced, as if, in <lb/>
            truth, everything was to be accomplished according to some <lb/>
            particular hour and appointed period of time.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " And when the sun was in the <lb/>
            west a flame arose ?"*</p>
          <p>14. It means either that the sun himself appeared in the <lb/>
            west in the similitude of a flame, or that some other flame <lb/>
            appeared at eventide, not lightning, but some fire like it, <lb/>
            which descended from above. The manifest interpretation <lb/>
            of the oracle is this; but we must now discuss that which <lb/>
            regards the inner sense.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the expression, " Behold there <lb/>
            was a smoking furnace and torches of fires, which passed <lb/>
            through the middle of those divisions ?"t</p>
          <p>15. The literal meaning of the statement is plain, for the <lb/>
            fountain or root of the divine word will have the victims <lb/>
            consumed, not by that fire which is given for our use, but <lb/>
            by that which descends from above, out of heaven, in order <lb/>
            that the purity of the essence of heaven may bear witness to <lb/>
            the sanctity of the victims.</p>
          <p>But if we regard the inward meaning of the words, all <lb/>
            things which are done beneath the moon are here coin­ <lb/>
            pared to a smoking furnace, on account of the vapour which <lb/>
            rises up out of the earth and water. As also the divisions <lb/>
            of nature are, as has been already shown, every portion of <lb/>
            the world being divided into two parts; and by these there <lb/>
            are kindled, as it were, torches of fire, being powers which <lb/>
            are more rapid in motion and more efficacious, being burn­ <lb/>
            ing, in truth, like divine fiery discourses, at one time keeping <lb/>
            the whole universe in a state of integrity reciprocally with <lb/>
            themselves, and at another cleansing away the superfluous <lb/>
            darkness.</p>
          <p>But the following interpretation may also be given with <lb/>
            propriety in a more familiar manner. Human life is like <lb/>
            unto a smoking furnace, because it has not a pure fire and <lb/>
            an unalloyed brilliancy, but a great deal of smoke, smoking <lb/>
            darkly through the flame, which causes mist and darkness, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 17. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            and an obscuration, not of the body but of the soul, so that <lb/>
            this last cannot discern things clearly, until God the re­ <lb/>
            deemer commands the heavenly lamps to arise, I mean those <lb/>
            more pure and more holy radiations which unite those parts <lb/>
            previously divided in two, on the right hand and on the left, <lb/>
            and, at the same time, illuminate them, being the causes of <lb/>
            harmony and of lucid clearness.</p>
          <p>Why did he say, " On that day, God made a covenant with <lb/>
            Abraham, saying, To thy seed will I give this land, from <lb/>
            the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates ?"*</p>
          <p>16. The literal expression describes the boundaries of the <lb/>
            space which lies in the middle, between the two rivers <lb/>
            Egyptus and Euphrates, for anciently the river was also <lb/>
            called by the same name as the district, Egypt, as the poet <lb/>
            also testifies when he says­ <lb/>
            " And in the river Egypt did I fix <lb/>
            My double-oared ships.”† <lb/>
            But if we look to the inner meaning of the expression, it <lb/>
            intimates happiness, which is the perfect fulness of three <lb/>
            good things, namely, of spiritual, and corporeal, and ex­ <lb/>
            ternal blessings, as some of those men describe it in their <lb/>
            panegyrics, who were afterwards called philosophers, such <lb/>
            as Aristotle and the Peripatetics ; nevertheless, such a giving <lb/>
            of the law as this is called Pythagorean.</p>
          <p>Therefore the Egypt is a symbol of corporeal and external <lb/>
            blessings, and the Euphrates of spiritual advantages, in <lb/>
            which alone, it is plain, their real joy consists, which has <lb/>
            wisdom and all the other virtues for its foundation; and the <lb/>
            boundaries of this happiness are very rightly described as <lb/>
            beginning with the Egyptus and ending with the Euphrates; <lb/>
            for the things affecting the soul come at the end, which we <lb/>
            usually approach with difficulty after we have passed through <lb/>
            corporeal and external things, in such a manner that, by <lb/>
            this progress, we have felt our unity, the integrity of our <lb/>
            outward senses, and the beauty and strength which existed <lb/>
            in our youth, advance, increase, and come to maturity. And <note type="footnote"> * Genesis, xv. 19. </note><note type="footnote"> † The line is in Odyssey xiv. 253.

              in a similar manner, those things which relate to acquiring <lb/>
              gain and to trafficking, as the management of ships, and <lb/>
              agriculture, and commerce; for it is well said, that all <lb/>
              things, especially these above-mentioned, become a young <lb/>
              man.</p>
          <p>Who are the Kenites, the Kenezites, and the Kadmon­ <lb/>

            and the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the <lb/>
            Jebusites ?*</p>
          <p>17. Ten nations of wickedness are here enumerated, which <lb/>
            he here destroys because of their neighbourhood, since the <lb/>
            number ten, when false and improperly stamped, is very <lb/>
            near to that which is good and an object of affection; but <lb/>
            the complete perfection of the number ten is exceedingly <lb/>
            fit, as being the measure of infinite numbers, since the world <lb/>
            is arranged in accordance with it, and so likewise is the <lb/>
            mind of the wise man, the substance of which, nevertheless, <lb/>
            wickedness perverts and overthrows, despising all very <lb/>
            necessary powers, so that that alone remains which the <lb/>
            sacred writer has said, namely, that the-pursuit of virtue is <lb/>
            a blessing, for the wicked man is such that he embraces <lb/>
            vague opinions rather than truth, and of such is Ishmael, <lb/>
            though the seed of the prophets.</p>
          <p>Why it was that Sarah, the wife of Abraham, bore him <lb/>
            no children Pf</p>
          <p>18. The mother of opinion is here spoken of as barren. <lb/>
            In the first place in order that the son of generation might <lb/>
            appear more wonderful, as being born by a miracle. In the <lb/>
            second place in order that his conception and nativity might <lb/>
            appear to be owing not more to the marriage of the man <lb/>
            than to divine providence. For it is not owing to the <lb/>
            faculty of conception that a barren woman should bear a <lb/>
            son, but rather to the operation of divine power. This is <lb/>
            the literal meaning of the statement.</p>
          <p>But if we look to its inward sense, then we shall say, in <lb/>
            the first place, that to bring forth is peculiar to the female <lb/>
            sex, as to beget is the office of the male : therefore God <lb/>
            wills in the first place to render the mind, which is filled <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 20. </note><note type="footnote">f Genesis xvi. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            with virtue, like to the male sex rather than to the female, <lb/>
            thinking it suited to its character to be active, not passive. <lb/>
            In the second place both do generate, both the virtuous <lb/>
            mind and the wicked one: but they generate in a different <lb/>
            manner, and they produce contrary offspring, the virtuous <lb/>
            mind producing good and useful things, but the depraved or <lb/>
            wicked mind producing base and useless things.</p>
          <p>In the third place he who is still advancing and making <lb/>
            progress is to be incited to the summit itself, and is near to <lb/>
            the light which by some persons is said to be delivered to <lb/>
            oblivion, and to be made unknown. He therefore, as he is <lb/>
            making progress, does not generate bad things, nor yet <lb/>
            good things, because he is not yet perfect; but he resembles <lb/>
            that man who is neither sick nor yet thoroughly well, but <lb/>
            who, after a long sickness, is at last proceeding to con­ <lb/>
            valescence.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, she had an <lb/>
            Egyptian handmaid whose name was Hagar ?*</p>
          <p>19. Hagar is interpreted travelling, and she is the servant <lb/>
            of a more perfect nature, being by nature an Egyptian less <lb/>
            naturally; for the study of encyclical learning loves an <lb/>
            abundance of knowledge, and abundant knowledge is, as it <lb/>
            were, the handmaid of virtue, since the whole course and <lb/>
            connection of sciences and arts is subservient to his use <lb/>
            who is able to profit by their acquisition so as to attain to <lb/>
            virtue, for virtue has the soul for its abode ; but the course <lb/>
            of arts and sciences stands in need of bodily instruments.</p>
          <p>But the body is symbolically Egypt; therefore the <lb/>
            sacred writer here properly asserts the likeness of encyclical <lb/>
            knowledge to Egypt. Nevertheless he has also given it a <lb/>
            name by reason of its travelling abroad, since sophistry is a <lb/>
            foreign thing, unconnected with the acquisition of that <lb/>
            wisdom which alone is native, and which alone is necessary, <lb/>
            which is the mistress of intermediate wisdom, and which <lb/>
            conducts itself in a beautiful course through the guidance <lb/>
            of encyclical studies.</p>
          <p>Why did Sarah say to Abraham, Behold the Lord has <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            shut me up so that I shall not bring forth: go in now unto <lb/>
            my handmaid so as to beget a son by her?*</p>
          <p>20. In the actual letter of this statement it is the same <lb/>
            thing to feel no envy, and also to provide for the welfare of <lb/>
            the wise man who is her husband and her genuine brother; <lb/>
            so that she, wishing to find a remedy for her own barrenness <lb/>
            by means of her handmaid of whom she was mistress, gives <lb/>
            her as a concubine to her husband. But there is a still <lb/>
            greater abundance of her affection towards her husband <lb/>
            indicated by this ; for as she herself was accounted barren, <lb/>
            she did not think it reasonable that the family of her <lb/>
            husband should be left entirely without offspring, but <lb/>
            preferred his advantage to her own dignity. This is what <lb/>
            is indicated by this statement taken literally.</p>
          <p>But if we look to the inner sense of the passage it bears <lb/>
            such an interpretation as this: it becomes those persons <lb/>
            who are unable in respect of their virtue to bring forth <lb/>
            beautiful works deserving of praise, to apply themselves to <lb/>
            the intermediate kind of study, and, if I may so express <lb/>
            myself, to procure themselves children from the encyclical <lb/>
            branches of knowledge; for an abundance of knowledge <lb/>
            is as it were the whetstone of the mind and of the in­ <lb/>
            tellect.</p>
          <p>And it is with great propriety that she says, The Lord <lb/>
            has shut me up; for that which is shut up is generally <lb/>
            opened again at a seasonable time. Therefore she was not <lb/>
            destitute of hope, nor was her wisdom fixed in the belief <lb/>
            that she should be for ever without offspring, but she knew <lb/>
            that some day or other she should bring forth. Neverthe­ <lb/>
            less she will not bring forth at present, but when the soul <lb/>
            displays the purity of its perfection. But inasmuch as it is <lb/>
            at present imperfect it is satisfied with using a milder kind <lb/>
            of learning, such as is attainable by encyclical studies. On <lb/>
            which account it is not without a purpose that in the sacred <lb/>
            contests at Olympia also, those who are unable to attain to <lb/>
            the first prize of victory are contented to be thought <lb/>
            worthy of the second; for there is offered to the com­ <lb/>
            petitors a first, and a second, and a third prize by the <lb/>
            presidents of the games, who are representatives of nature. <note type="footnote"> Genesis xvi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="427"/>
            So now to her the sacred writer attributes the first prize of <lb/>
            virtues, and the second prize of encyclical study.</p>
          <p>Why has he called Abraham's wife Sarah, for he says, <lb/>
            Sarah the wife of Abraham, taking her handmaid Hagar the <lb/>
            Egyptian, gave her into his hand ?*</p>
          <p>21. The sacred writer here sums up with his approbation <lb/>
            the marriage of the good on account of those who are <lb/>
            incontinent and lascivious ; for those • persons despise their <lb/>
            wise wives for the sake of concubines, whom they love with <lb/>
            a frantic passion: on which account he here introduces the <lb/>
            man endued with virtue, the constant husband of one wife, <lb/>
            at that time in which it was lawful for him to make use of <lb/>
            her handmaid; and his wife in fact indicates that he is wise, <lb/>
            that is to say temperate, when he enters into the bed of <lb/>
            another woman, since his connection with his concubine <lb/>
            was only a connection of the body for the sake of propagat­ <lb/>
            ing children ; but his union with his wife was that of two <lb/>
            souls joined together in harmony by heavenly affection. <lb/>
            This is the literal effect of the statement.</p>
          <p>But if we look to the inner meaning of it, then he who <lb/>
            has truly entrusted all his secret wishes to wisdom, and <lb/>
            justice, and the other virtues, when once he has received <lb/>
            the counsel of wisdom, and has tasted the joys of a matri­ <lb/>
            monial connection with it, remains constant to it as the <lb/>
            partner and companion of his life; although encyclical <lb/>
            education would lead him in a beautiful course, since when <lb/>
            the man eminent in virtue has become master of the <lb/>
            sciences of geometry, and arithmetic, and grammar, and <lb/>
            rhetoric, and the other exercises of the mind, he is not the <lb/>
            less on that account mindful of the pursuit of honesty, but <lb/>
            is borne on towards the one as to a necessary aim, to the <lb/>
            other as an accessory.</p>
          <p>But it is altogether fair that that fact also should meet <lb/>
            with our approbation,-the fact I mean of his calling his <lb/>
            handmaid also by the name of wife, because he went up to <lb/>
            her bed out of complacency to and at the exhortation of his <lb/>
            real wife, and not of his own genuine inclination ; on which <lb/>
            account he no longer calls her his handmaid, that even if it <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            were not wholly deserved still his handmaid having been <lb/>
            given to him to wife might at least obtain the same title.</p>
          <p>But those who study allegory may be allowed to say that <lb/>
            the exercise of the middle discipline also stands in the place <lb/>
            of a concubine, having nevertheless the shape and orna­ <lb/>
            ments of a wife, for all encyclical learning re-produces in <lb/>
            itselt and imitates genuine virtue.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " When she saw that she had <lb/>
            conceived her mistress was despised before her ?”*</p>
          <p>22. The sacred writer now carefully calls Sarah the <lb/>
            mistress when it might else have been thought that her <lb/>
            dignity was diminished, and that she was surpassed by her <lb/>
            handmaid, that she, that is, who had no children, was sur­ <lb/>
            passed by her who was gifted with offspring.</p>
          <p>But this kind of language is extended to nearly all the <lb/>
            necessary affairs of human life: for a poor man who is wise <lb/>
            is more approved of and is superior in authority to a <lb/>
            rich man who is destitute of wisdom and reputation, or <lb/>
            than a boasting man; and even a sick man who is wise is <lb/>
            better than a foolish man who is well; for whatever is <lb/>
            united with wisdom is genuine, and is endued with an <lb/>
            authority of its own, but whatever is combined with folly is <lb/>
            found to be slavish and inconstant.</p>
          <p>But it has been excellently said not that she despised her <lb/>
            mistress, but that her mistress was despised; for the one <lb/>
            statement would imply an accusation of the person, but the <lb/>
            other contains only a declaration of an event. The scrip­ <lb/>
            ture forsooth does not intend here to impute blame to <lb/>
            any one while praising another, but only to hand down in <lb/>
            an intelligible manner the pure truth of the facts.</p>
          <p>This is what is indicated by the literal statement. But if <lb/>
            we seek the inner meaning of the words, whoever honours <lb/>
            and embraces rank before genius and wisdom, and whoever <lb/>
            esteems and considers the external senses of more im­ <lb/>
            portance than prudence and counsel, is departing from the <lb/>
            real character of things, thinking that they have brought <lb/>
            forth much offspring, and that having produced a great <lb/>
            generation of visible things they are great and perfect <lb/>
            goods, and in a singular degree noble, but that barrenness <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            in this respect is evil, and deserving of disapprobation, <lb/>
            because they do not see that invisible seed and that <lb/>
            offspring which is appreciable only by the intellect, which <lb/>
            the mind is accustomed to generate in itself and by itself.</p>
          <p>Why does Sarah as it were repent of what she has done, <lb/>
            saying to Abraham, I am receiving injury from you : I gave <lb/>
            my handmaid into your bosom, and now, because she sees <lb/>
            that she has conceived, I am despised before her ?*</p>
          <p>23. This language indicates her anxiety and hesitation; <lb/>
            displaying them first in the expression, " since," that is to <lb/>
            say from the time that I gave my handmaiden, and in the <lb/>
            second place it betokens a regard to the person of whom <lb/>
            complaint is made, for she says, “ I am receiving injury from <lb/>
            you," a statement which in fact is a reproof, since she thinks <lb/>
            that her husband ought always to be preserved without any <lb/>
            stain, or any liability to blame, always virtuous and true, <lb/>
            and in no respect forgetful of her, for she always introduces <lb/>
            him, honouring him with all possible veneration, and calling <lb/>
            him lord.</p>
          <p>Nevertheless, the first fact stated by her is true; for <lb/>
            from the time that she gave her handmaiden to him to be <lb/>
            his concubine, she herself was looked upon as despised. <lb/>
            This is the literal meaning of her words.</p>
          <p>But if we look to their inner sense, when any one bestows <lb/>
            on another the handmaid of wisdom, she being influenced <lb/>
            by the counsels of sophistry, will, because she is ignorant <lb/>
            of propriety, despise her mistress; for as she herself pos­ <lb/>
            sesses encyclical knowledge, and is delighted with its bril­ <lb/>
            liancy,.where every one of the separate branches of education <lb/>
            is by itself very attractive to the soul, as if it possesses <lb/>
            the power of drawing it by force to itself, then she, the <lb/>
            handmaiden, can no longer agree with her mistress, that is <lb/>
            to say, with the image of wisdom and its glorious and admi­ <lb/>
            rable beauty, until that acute judge of all things, the word <lb/>
            of God, coming in, separates and distinguishes what is <lb/>
            probable from what is true, and the middle from the ex­ <lb/>
            tremities, and what is second from what is placed in the <lb/>
            first rank. On which account Sarah says, at the end of her <lb/>
            remonstrance, " Let God judge between me and thee." <note type="footnote"> 1 Genesis xvi. 5. </note> <pb n="430"/>
            </p>
          <p>Why does Abraham say, " Behold thy handmaid is in thy <lb/>
            hand, do unto her what seems good to thee ?"*</p>
          <p>24. The literal expression used by the wise man con­ <lb/>
            tains a panegyric; for he does not call the woman who <lb/>
            had conceived by himself, his wife, or his concubine, but the <lb/>
            handmaiden of his wife. But since he saw that she also <lb/>
            was a mother, he did not indulge in anger and embitter the <lb/>
            feelings of her mind, but rather tranquillised her, and made <lb/>
            her prudent.</p>
          <p>But the passage contains an allegory in the expression, <lb/>
            "In thy hand:" as if, if I may so say, sophistry lives under <lb/>
            the dominion of wisdom, which indeed does spring forth <lb/>
            from the same fountain, but only in one part, and not di­ <lb/>
            rectly ; nor does it preserve the whole of its emanations <lb/>
            pure, but draws up with its waters many fetid things, and <lb/>
            many others of a similar character. Since, therefore, it is <lb/>
            in thy hand and in thy power (for to whomsoever wisdom <lb/>
            belongs, he is possessed also of all the branches of encyclical <lb/>
            learning), do with it whatsoever pleases thee, for I am <lb/>
            quite persuaded that you will judge with not more severity <lb/>
            than justice ; because that very thing is especially agreeable <lb/>
            to you: I mean the distributing to every one according to <lb/>
            his deserts, and giving to no one more than is just, either <lb/>
            in the way of honouring or despising him.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, Sarah afflicted her ? t</p>
          <p>25. The literal meaning of the words is plain: but if we <lb/>
            look to the inner sense of them, they contain a principle <lb/>
            of this kind. It is not every affliction that is injurious, but <lb/>
            there are even some occasions when they are salutary; and <lb/>
            this is experienced by sick men at the hands of physicians, <lb/>
            and by boys under their tutors, and by foolish people from <lb/>
            those who correct them so as to bring them to wisdom. <lb/>
            And this I can by no means consent to call affliction, but <lb/>
            rather the salvation and benefit of both soul and body.</p>
          <p>Now a part of such benefit wisdom affords to the circle <lb/>
            of encyclical knowledge; rightly admonishing the soul <lb/>
            which is devoted to an abundance of discipline, and which <lb/>
            is pregnant with sophism, not to rebel as if it had acquired <note type="footnote"> * Genesis .vi. 6. </note><note type="footnote">t Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            some great and excellent good, but to acquiesce and vene­ <lb/>
            rate that superior and more excellent nature as its genuine <lb/>
            mistress, in whose power is constancy itself, and authority <lb/>
            over all things.</p>
          <p>Why did Hagar flee from her face ?*</p>
          <p>26. It is not every soul which is capable of proper <lb/>
            respect and of submitting to salutary discipline, but the <lb/>
            mind which is gentle, and good-tempered, and consistent <lb/>
            loves reproof, and becomes more and more attached to those <lb/>
            who correct it. But the stubborn soul becomes malignant <lb/>
            and hates them, and turns from them, and flees away from <lb/>
            them, preferring those discourses which are agreeable rather <lb/>
            than those which tend to his advantage, and looking upon <lb/>
            them as more excellent.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " The angel of the <lb/>
            Lord found her sitting by a fountain of water in the desert <lb/>
            in the way to Sur ?”†</p>
          <p>27. All these statements are as it were symbols by <lb/>
            which the sacred writer indicates that the well-instructed <lb/>
            soul, which is the possession of virtue, is nevertheless not <lb/>
            yet able to discern the beauty of her mistress. They are, I <lb/>
            say, symbols; I mean the statements that she was found, and <lb/>
            that she was found by an angel in the desert, and in no <lb/>
            other way than that leading to Sur. However we must <lb/>
            begin with what is plain.</p>
          <p>Now the too subtle sophist and the real lover of dispu­ <lb/>
            tations is commonly unable to be detected by reason of his <lb/>
            artifices and sophistical persuasions, with which he is ac­ <lb/>
            customed to deceive and perplex men. But he who, being <lb/>
            free from bad habits, has only an eager desire for obtaining <lb/>
            instruction by the course of encyclical training, although he <lb/>
            is difficult to be detected, is yet not altogether incapable of <lb/>
            being so; for perdition is near at hand to him who cannot <lb/>
            be detected, but safety to him who can be discovered, <lb/>
            especially when he is sought for and found by a more holy <lb/>
            and more excellent spirit. And who is more holy and more <lb/>
            excellent than the angel of the Lord? For it is to him <lb/>
            that it has been entrusted to seek out the erring soul, the <note type="footnote"> Genesis xvi. 6. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvi. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            soul which, on account of its presumed erudition, IS con­ <lb/>
            tinually ignorant of her whom it ought to respect, but still <lb/>
            she could be susceptible of correction and amendment; for <lb/>
            which object she was sought out. Nor was she found <lb/>
            imperfect, but ready to the hand, since the soul was found <lb/>
            which had fled from perfect virtue, not being able to submit <lb/>
            to discipline.</p>
          <p>But the third symbol takes place after she is found and <lb/>
            after the discovery has been made by an angel, namely, in <lb/>
            the fact of her being found by a fountain, that is to say, by <lb/>
            nature ; for it is nature which bestows on clever people <lb/>
            abilities in proportion to the industry of each individual, <lb/>
            effacing unseasonable learning, which is no learning at all: <lb/>
            and praise is implied in the very place in which the soul is <lb/>
            found, which is thirsting after genius and after its placid <lb/>
            law, wishing to draw water while in the society of those who <lb/>
            drink wine; for thus it associates with those who feed upon <lb/>
            and are delighted with the exercise of proper training, <lb/>
            where nature itself affords sufficient nourishment, namely, <lb/>
            education and instruction as if from a fountain.</p>
          <p>The fourth symbol is contained in the fact that the <lb/>
            discovery took place in the desert; since difficulty coming <lb/>
            over each of the outward senses, together with an influx of <lb/>
            each separate desire, represses the mind, and does not <lb/>
            permit it to drink pure water: but when it cannot avoid <lb/>
            these things as in the desert, it acquiesces, and, abandoning <lb/>
            the thoughts which agitated and perplexed it, it becomes <lb/>
            convalescent, so as to receive a hope not only of life, but <lb/>
            even of eternal life.</p>
          <p>The fifth symbol is contained in the fact that she was <lb/>
            found in the way ; for dispositions which are incorrigible <lb/>
            are led by devious paths; but that one which can be changed <lb/>
            for the better, lo! it proceeds along the road which leads to <lb/>
            virtue, and that road is like a fortified wall ani guardian to <lb/>
            the souls which are capable of being saved, for Sur means <lb/>
            a fortified wall.</p>
          <p>Do you not see, then, that the whole is a symbolical, or <lb/>
            indeed a legitimate, figure of an improving soul ? And, in <lb/>
            fact, the soul which is improving does not perish as one <lb/>
            which is wholly foolish does; for if tha divine word be <lb/>
            found by it, then again it seeks it; and he who is not pure <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            and clean in his habits and disposition, flees from the divine <lb/>
            word; but yet he has a fountain of water in which he <lb/>
            washes away his vices and wickednesses, drawing from <lb/>
            thence the fertility of the law.</p>
          <p>Besides this, it loves the desert, to which it has fled from <lb/>
            its vices and wickednesses, and when it has once beheld the <lb/>
            way of virtue it returns from the devious paths of wicked­ <lb/>
            ness. And all these things are fortified walls and bulwarks <lb/>
            to it, so as to protect it from being ever injured by any <lb/>
            words or circumstances which attack it, and from 'suffering <lb/>
            any damage.</p>
          <p>Why did the angel say to her, " Hagar, the handmaid of <lb/>
            Sarah, whence comest thou, and whither goest thou ?”*</p>
          <p>28. The plain letter of the question requires no explana­ <lb/>
            tion, for it is exceedingly clear; but with reference to the <lb/>
            inner meaning contained in it, there is some asperity ex­ <lb/>
            pressed ; since the divine word is full of instruction, and <lb/>
            is a physician of the infirmity of the soul. Therefore the <lb/>
            angel says to her, " Whence comest thou?" knowest thou <lb/>
            not what good thou hast abandoned? Art thou not altogether <lb/>
            lame and blind ? For thou dost not see at all; and though <lb/>
            endowed with the outward senses, dost not feel, and dost <lb/>
            not appear to me to have any portion whatever of intellect, <lb/>
            as if thou wert quite senseless.</p>
          <p>But " whither goest thou ?" From what excellence to <lb/>
            what misery ? Why have you so erred as to cast away the <lb/>
            blessings which you had in your power, and to pursue good <lb/>
            things which are more remote ?</p>
          <p>Do not, do not, I say, act thus; but, quitting your insane <lb/>
            impetuosity, go back again, and return into the same way as <lb/>
            before, looking upon wisdom as thy mistress, her whom you <lb/>
            had before as your governess and directress in all the things <lb/>
            which you did.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the answer, " I am fleeing from <lb/>
            the face of Sarah, my mistress ? " t</p>
          <p>29. It is reasonable to praise a sincere disposition, and to <lb/>
            think it friendly to truth. And moreover it is reasonable <lb/>
            now to admit the veracity of a mind which confesses what it <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 8. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IV. </note> <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            has suffered; for she says, "I am fleeing from the face," <lb/>
            that is to say, I have recoiled at the outward appearance of <lb/>
            wisdom and virtue; since, beholding its royal and imperial <lb/>
            presence, she trembled, not being able to endure to look <lb/>
            upon its majesty and sublimity, but rather thinking it an <lb/>
            object of avoidance; for there are some people who do not <lb/>
            turn from virtue from any hatred of it, but from a reve­ <lb/>
            rential modesty, looking upon themselves as unworthy to live <lb/>
            with such a mistress.</p>
          <p>Why did the angel say to her, “ Return to thy mistress <lb/>
            and be humbled beneath her hands ? " *</p>
          <p>30. As the letter is plain, we must rather investigate its <lb/>
            inner meaning. The word of God corrects that soul which <lb/>
            is able to be lured, and instructs it, and converts it, leading <lb/>
            it to wisdom as its mistress, that it may not, through being <lb/>
            abandoned by its mistress, rush at once into absurd folly. <lb/>
            But it warns it, not only to return to virtue, but also to be <lb/>
            humbled beneath its hands, that is to say, beneath its <lb/>
            several excellencies.</p>
          <p>But there are two kinds of humiliation; one, in accord­ <lb/>
            ance with defect, which arises from spiritual infirmity, which <lb/>
            it is easy to overcome, seize upon, and reprove. But there <lb/>
            is another kind which the word of the Lord enjoins, pro­ <lb/>
            ceeding from reverence and modesty; such as that humility <lb/>
            which children exhibit to their fathers, pupils to their <lb/>
            masters, and young men to the aged; since it is very <lb/>
            advantageous to be obedient, and to be subject to those who <lb/>
            are better than one's self; for he who has learnt to be under <lb/>
            authority is in a moment imbued with" a power which he <lb/>
            alone may exercise; for, although any one were to be <lb/>
            clothed with the authority of all the earth and sea, yet he <lb/>
            would not be able to possess the royal supremacy of virtue, <lb/>
            unless he had first been instructed and taught to obey.</p>
          <p>Why did the angel say to her, " I will multiply thy seed, <lb/>
            and it shall not be numbered for multitude ? ” t</p>
          <p>It is the honour of the docile mind not to be pre­ <lb/>
            sumptuous or rebellious on account of its progress in <lb/>
            knowledge, or because of the very useful seed which it has <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 8. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvi. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            received from various kinds of erudition; for it does not any <lb/>
            more, as word-catchers and cavillers do, employ all the <lb/>
            arguments of encyclical learning to establish any whimsical <lb/>
            object, but to prove the truth which is contained in them. <lb/>
            And when it has begun to prosecute that by diligent in­ <lb/>
            vestigation, it is then rendered worthy to behold the sight of <lb/>
            its mistress, free from all acceptance of persons, and from <lb/>
            all reproof.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " The angel said to <lb/>
            her, Behold, thou hast conceived, and thou shalt bring <lb/>
            forth a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael, because the <lb/>
            Lord has heard the voice of thy affliction P " *</p>
          <p>32. The literal sense of the words admits of no question <lb/>
            except this allegorical explanation. Erudition, which is <lb/>
            acquired and trained by the dispensation of virtue as a <lb/>
            mistress, is found not to be barren, but it has conceived the <lb/>
            seed of wisdom; and when it has conceived it brings forth ; <lb/>
            but it brings forth a work which is not perfect but im­ <lb/>
            perfect, like an infant which has need of care, and aliment, <lb/>
            and nourishment; for in truth, it is quite plain that the <lb/>
            offspring of a perfect soul is perfect, that is to say, its words <lb/>
            and works ; but that of the soul of the second class, which is <lb/>
            still lying in servitude and subordination, is more imperfect. <lb/>
            On which account it had a certain name given to it, <lb/>
            Ishmael, which is interpreted the hearing of God." But <lb/>
            hearing is honoured with the second dignity among the <lb/>
            outward senses, being next to sight; for nature has <lb/>
            arranged a succession of ranks in the contests of the senses, <lb/>
            giving the first place to the eyes, the second to the ears, <lb/>
            the third to the nostrils, and the fourth to that sense by <lb/>
            which we taste.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " He shall be a <lb/>
            wild man; his hand shall be upon every one, and every one's <lb/>
            hand shall be upon him, and he shall dwell over against all <lb/>
            his brethren? ” t</p>
          <p>33. If we look to the letter of the statement, up to this <lb/>
            time Ishmael has not any brothers, for he was the first <lb/>
            child of his parents. But the sacred writer is here figuring <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 11. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> IF 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            a certain nature, too secret to be thoroughly investigated; <lb/>
            for he has set forth the figure of his future character. And <lb/>
            such a figure evidently represents the sophist whose mother <lb/>
            is erudition or wisdom. But the sophist hImself is a man <lb/>
            of wild opinions; since the wise man as being civilized is <lb/>
            fitted for living in cities, and for urbanity, or for statesman­ <lb/>
            like and political companionship ; but he who is wild and a <lb/>
            man of wild opinions is immediately also quarrelsome.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that the sacred writer makes an <lb/>
            addition, saying, "His hand shall be upon every one, and <lb/>
            every one's hand shall be upon him;" for the abundance of <lb/>
            science and the use of erudition is able to contradict all <lb/>
            men. As those men of the present day who are called <lb/>
            academicians and inquirers, consistently setting no bounds <lb/>
            to the determinations of their will and resolution, and <lb/>
            among the different opinions which they investigate pre­ <lb/>
            ferring neither this nor that one, admit those men to be <lb/>
            philosophers who attack the opinions of every sect; and <lb/>
            those whom it has been usual to call opposers of will, as if <lb/>
            they called them or because they in <lb/>
            the first place raise contentions and declare themselves the <lb/>
            champions of their national sect, not to be convinced or put <lb/>
            down by those who oppose them. But they are all kinsmen, <lb/>
            and as it were brothers of the same womb, being the off­ <lb/>
            spring of one mother, namely, of philosophy.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that he says, "And he shall <lb/>
            dwell over against all his brethren;" for in good truth the <lb/>
            academician and the inquirer are diametrically opposed to <lb/>
            sects, finding fault in each of them with their certain limi­ <lb/>
            tation of the resolution.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, " But Hagar called on the name of the <lb/>
            Lord, who spoke to her, saying, ' Thou God who hast had <lb/>
            regard unto me.' Because he said, ' In truth I have beheld <lb/>
            thee appearing before me.' " *</p>
          <p>34. In the first place, take notice carefully that the <lb/>
            angel, after the manner of the handmaiden of wisdom, was <lb/>
            a minister to her on the part of God. But still why is he <lb/>
            here called Lord or God who ought only to have been styled <lb/>
            his angel ? It was in order to adapt the fact to the proper <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            person; for it was right that the Lord and chief of all the <lb/>
            universe should appear to wisdom as God, and that his <lb/>
            word should appear as a minister to the handmaid and <lb/>
            servant of wisdom.</p>
          <p>But we may not suppose that she mistakenly looked upon <lb/>
            the angel as God; for those who are unable to behold the <lb/>
            first cause may easily be deceived and look upon the second <lb/>
            as the first; in the same manner as he who has but weak <lb/>
            sight, not being able to behold the sun which is in heaven <lb/>
            in its real appearance, thinks that the ray which falls upon <lb/>
            the earth is the sun itself; and those who have never seen <lb/>
            the king attribute frequently the dignity of the supreme <lb/>
            sovereign to his ministers.</p>
          <p>And in truth mild and rustic men who never have beheld <lb/>
            a city, not even from the summits of the hills where they <lb/>
            live, think every country house or farm-yard a mighty city, <lb/>
            and look upon the people who dwell there as citizens of a <lb/>
            great city, out of ignorance of what a city really is.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " On this account she called that <lb/>
            well the well of him whom I have seen face to face ? " *</p>
          <p>35. The well has both a spring and depth. But the <lb/>
            learning of the students of encyclical science is neither all <lb/>
            on the surface, nor is it destitute of first principles; for it <lb/>
            has for its source corrective discipline. Therefore it is with <lb/>
            perfect correctness that she says that the angel appeared <lb/>
            before the well as God; since the erudition of the encyclical <lb/>
            training possessing the second rank is supposed to rejoice in <lb/>
            the first authority, though it is in reality separated from <lb/>
            that first wisdom which it is permitted to wise men to <lb/>
            behold, but not to sophists.</p>
          <p>Why is the well said to have been between Cadesh and <lb/>
            Pharan ? t</p>
          <p>36. Cadesh is interpreted holy, but Pharan is translated <lb/>
            hail, or corn.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of the statement, " Hagar brought <lb/>
            forth a son to Abraham ? " ‡</p>
          <p>37. It is made in perfect accordance with nature; for no <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 14. </note><note type="footnote">+ Ibid. </note><note type="footnote">‡ Genesis xvi. 1 . </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            habit of possession brings forth for itself, but for him who <lb/>
            possesses it; as grammar does for the grammarian, and <lb/>
            music for the musician, and mathematical science for the <lb/>
            mathematician; because it is a part of him, and stands in <lb/>
            need of him. And the habit is not received as a thing in <lb/>
            need of something, just as fire has no need of heat, for it is <lb/>
            heat to itself; and it gives a portion of the participation in <lb/>
            it to those who approach it.</p>
          <p>Why is Abraham said to have been eighty and six years <lb/>
            old when Hagar bore Ishmael to him ?</p>
          <p>38. Because the number which follows eighty, that is to <lb/>
            say six, is the first perfect number, being equal to its parts, <lb/>
            and being the first number which is composed of the multi­ <lb/>
            plication of an odd and an even number; receiving also <lb/>
            something from its efficient cause according to the odd or <lb/>
            redundant number, and from its material and effective <lb/>
            cause according to the even number. On which account, <lb/>
            among the most ancient of our ancestors, some persons have <lb/>
            called it matrimony, and others harmony; and our sacred <lb/>
            historian too has divided the creation of the world into six <lb/>
            days.</p>
          <p>But among numbers, eighty rejoices in perfect harmony, <lb/>
            since it is composed of two generous diameters in a double <lb/>
            and treble proportion, according to the figure of a square of <lb/>
            four sides. And it contains within itself all the four <lb/>
            inferences; the arithmetical, and the geometrical, and the <lb/>
            harmonious one.</p>
          <p>Being in the first place composed of double numbers, as <lb/>
            of six, eight, nine, twelve, the union of which makes thirty- <lb/>
            five; in the second place of triple numbers, six, nine, twelve, <lb/>
            eighteen, the sum of which amounts to forty-five. And <lb/>
            from these two numbers thirty-five and forty-five, the whole <lb/>
            number eighty is completed.</p>
          <p>Again, when the sacred historian Moses himself began by <lb/>
            divine inspiration to utter the oracular precepts which he <lb/>
            was commissioned to deliver, he was eighty years old. And <lb/>
            the first man who existed of our nation according to the law <lb/>
            of circumcision, being circumcised on the eighth day, being <lb/>
            eminent for virtue, bears that name of joy, being called Isaac <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            in the Chaldaic tongue, and Isaac means laughter; being <lb/>
            naturally called so because nature rejoices or laughs at <lb/>
            everything, being never vexed at any thing which is done in <lb/>
            the world, but rather looking with complacency on every <lb/>
            thing which occurs as being done well and profitably.</p>
          <p>Why when he was ninety and nine years old does the <lb/>
            sacred writer say, " The Lord God appeared to him and said, <lb/>
            I am the Lord thy God?"*</p>
          <p>39. He here makes use of both the titles of each superior <lb/>
            virtue, applying them in the case of his address to the wis­ <lb/>
            man, because it was by them that all things were created, <lb/>
            and by them that the world is regulated after it had been <lb/>
            created. By one of them therefore the wise man, just in <lb/>
            the same manner as the world itself, was fashioned and made <lb/>
            according to the likeness of God; and God is the name of <lb/>
            creative virtue; and by the other of them that he was made <lb/>
            according to the Lord, as falling under his authority and <lb/>
            supreme power.</p>
          <p>Therefore he designs here to show that the man who is <lb/>
            conspicuous in virtue is both a citizen of the world, and also <lb/>
            equal in dignity to the whole world, declaring that both the <lb/>
            virtues of the world, the divine and the royal attributes, are in <lb/>
            a singular manner appointed to and set over him as protectors. <lb/>
            And it was with great correctness and propriety that this <lb/>
            appearance took place when he was about ninety and nine <lb/>
            years old, because that number is very near the hundred. <lb/>
            And the number a hundred is composed of the number ten <lb/>
            multiplied by itself, which the sacred historian calls the <lb/>
            holy of holies.</p>
          <p>Since the first court, the first ten, is simply called holy, <lb/>
            and that is permitted to be entered by the sweepers of the <lb/>
            temple; but the ten of tens, which he again enjoins the <lb/>
            sweepers of the temple to pay above all things to the exist­ <lb/>
            ing high priest, is the number ten computed along with <lb/>
            the number a hundred, for what else is the tenth of the <lb/>
            tenths but the hundredth ?</p>
          <p>However the number ninety and nine has been set forth <lb/>
            and adorned not only by its affinity to the number a hundred, <lb/>
            but it has also received a particular participation in a wonder­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            ful nature, since it consists of the number fifty, and of seven <lb/>
            times seven. For the fiftieth year, as the year of Pentecost <lb/>
            or the Jubilee, is called remission in the giving forth of the <lb/>
            law, as then all things are given their liberty, whether living <lb/>
            or inanimate.</p>
          <p>And the mystery of the seventh year is one of quiet and <lb/>
            profound peace to both body and soul. For the seventh <lb/>
            is the recollection of all the good things which come of their <lb/>
            own accord without industry or labour, which at the first <lb/>
            creation of the world nature produced of herself; but the <lb/>
            number forty-nine, consisting as it does of seven times seven, <lb/>
            indicates no trifling blessings, but rather those which have <lb/>
            virtue and wisdom, in such a degree as to contribute to in­ <lb/>
            vincible and mighty constancy.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " Do thou please me, and keep <lb/>
            thyself from stain, and I will make my treaty between me and <lb/>
            thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly ? *</p>
          <p>40. God here lays down a law for the human race in a <lb/>
            somewhat familiar manner; for he who has no participation <lb/>
            in wickedness and is free from evil, will be perfectly good, <lb/>
            which is peculiar to incorporeal natures. But those who are <lb/>
            in the body are called good in proportion to the measure in <lb/>
            which wickedness and the practice of sin are removed from <lb/>
            them. Therefore the life of those men has appeared honour­ <lb/>
            able, not that of those who have been free from sickness <lb/>
            from the beginning to the end, but that of those who from a <lb/>
            state of infirmity have advanced to sanity; on which account <lb/>
            he says directly and plainly, " Keep thyself free from stain," <lb/>
            for it is sufficient to conduct a mortal nature to felicity not <lb/>
            to be blamed, and neither to do nor say anything deserving of <lb/>
            reproof; and such conduct is at once pleasing to the Father.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is that he said, " Do thou please me, and keep <lb/>
            thyself free from stain." Where the form of expression <lb/>
            implies a mutual conversion; since the habits which please <lb/>
            God do not deserve reproof, and he who keeps himself free <lb/>
            from stain and avoids reproof in all things is altogether <lb/>
            pleasing to God. Therefore he promises to bestow a double <lb/>
            blessing on him who keeps himself free from all reproof; in <lb/>
            the first place, to make him the guardian of the deposits of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            the divine covenant: and in the second place to cause him <lb/>
            to increase to a multitude without any limit.</p>
          <p>For that expression, " I will make my treaty, or covenant, <lb/>
            between me and thee," shows the office of guardianship of the <lb/>
            truth which is entrusted to an honest mail ; for the whole <lb/>
            treaty of God is the incorporeal word; which is the form <lb/>
            and measure of the universe according to which this world <lb/>
            was made. And then repeating the expression, “ I will <lb/>
            multiply thee exceedingly," twice manifestly shows the <lb/>
            immense numbers to which the multitude promised shall <lb/>
            grow, I mean the increase which shall take place in the <lb/>
            people, not in human virtue.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " Abraham fell on his face ?" *</p>
          <p>41. The present expression is the interpretation of what <lb/>
            has already been promised ; for God had said, " Keep thyself <lb/>
            free from stain," but there is no other cause of a man leading <lb/>
            a life which is disapproved but the outward sense, because <lb/>
            that is the origin and source of the passions; on which <lb/>
            account he rightly and properly falls on his face, that is to <lb/>
            say, the offences caused by the outward senses fall to the <lb/>
            bottom, showing that the man is now devoted to all good <lb/>
            works.</p>
          <p>This is enough to say in the first place. But in the second <lb/>
            place we must say that he was so struck by the manifest <lb/>
            appearance of the living God that he was scarcely able to <lb/>
            behold him through fear, but fell to the ground and offered <lb/>
            adoration, being overwhelmed with awe at the appearance <lb/>
            which presented itself to him.</p>
          <p>In the third place, he fell to the ground on account of the <lb/>
            revelation thus made to him, at the form of his appearance <lb/>
            by the living God who exists alone, whom he knew and <lb/>
            regarded as truth opposed to created nature ; since the one <lb/>
            exists in unvarying constancy and the other vacillates and <lb/>
            falls into its proper place, that is to say, to the earth.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, “ And God conversed with him, <lb/>
            saying, And I, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou <lb/>
            shalt be the father of a multitude of nations ?”‡</p>
          <p>42. Since he had previously used the expression,“ "treaty," <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 3. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            he now proceeds to say, do not seek that treaty in letters, <lb/>
            since I myself, in accordance with what has been said before, <lb/>
            am myself the genuine and true covenant.</p>
          <p>For after he has shown himself and said, " I," he makes <lb/>
            an addition, saying, "Behold, my covenant," which is nothing <lb/>
            but I myself; for I am myself my covenant, according to <lb/>
            which my treaty and agreement are made and agreed to, and <lb/>
            according to which again all things are properly distributed <lb/>
            and arranged. Now the form of this prototypal treaty is <lb/>
            put together from the ideas and incorporeal measures and <lb/>
            forms in accordance with which this world was made. Is it <lb/>
            not therefore a climax to the benefits which the Father be­ <lb/>
            stowed on the wise man, to raise him up and conduct him not <lb/>
            only from earth to heaven, nor only from heaven to the <lb/>
            incorporeal world appreciable only by the intellect, but also <lb/>
            to draw him up from this world to himself, showing himself <lb/>
            to him, not as he is in himself, for that is not possible but <lb/>
            as far as the visual organs of the beholder who beholds virtue <lb/>
            herself as appreciable by the intellect are able to attain to.</p>
          <p>And it is on this account that he says, " Be no more a <lb/>
            son but a father; and the father, not of one individual but <lb/>
            of a multitude ; and of a multitude, not according to a part, <lb/>
            but of all nations; therefore of the revealed promises two <lb/>
            admit of a literal interpretation, but the third of one which <lb/>
            is rather spiritual. One of those which admit of a literal <lb/>
            interpretation is to be construed in this way: in truth thou <lb/>
            shalt be the father of nations, and shalt beget nations, that <lb/>
            is to say, each individual among thy sons shall be the <lb/>
            founder of a nation.</p>
          <p>But the second is of this kind; like a father you shall be <lb/>
            clothed with power over, and authority to rule, many na­ <lb/>
            tions ; for a lover of God is necessarily and at once also a <lb/>
            lover of men; so that he will diligently devote his attention, <lb/>
            not only to his relations but also to all mankind, and <lb/>
            especially to those who are able to go through the discipline <lb/>
            of strict attention, and who are of a disposition the reverse <lb/>
            of anything cruel or hard, but of one which easily submits <lb/>
            to virtue, and willingly gives obedience to right reason.</p>
          <p>But the third we may explain under this allegory: the <lb/>
            multitude of nations spoken of indicates as it were the <lb/>
            multifarious inclination of the will in each of our minds, <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            both those inclinations which it is accustomed to form with <lb/>
            reference to itself, and also those others which it admits by <lb/>
            the agency of the senses, as they enter clandestinely through <lb/>
            the intervention of the imagination, and if the mind pos­ <lb/>
            sesses the supreme authority over all these, it, like a corn­ <lb/>
            mon father, turns them to better objects, cherishing their <lb/>
            infant opinions, as it were, with milk, exhorting those which <lb/>
            are older and more mature, though still imperfect, to im­ <lb/>
            provement, and honouring with commendation those which <lb/>
            perform their duty aright; and again, putting a bridle, by <lb/>
            means of discipline and reproof, on those which rebel and <lb/>
            act rashly; since, wishing to imitate the Deity, it receives a <lb/>
            twofold influx from the virtues of that same being, one from <lb/>
            his beneficent attributes and another from his avenging <lb/>
            might, as if from two sources; therefore the docile receive <lb/>
            his kindness, and towards the rebellious he uses reproof; so <lb/>
            that some are led to improvement by praise and others by <lb/>
            chastisement: in truth, he who is eminent for virtue is able <lb/>
            to be of great, and extensive, and just service to all, accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his power.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " Thy name shall not be called <lb/>
            Abram, but Abraham shall thy name be ?"*</p>
          <p>43. Some of those who are destitute of all knowledge of <lb/>
            music and dancing, some indeed being wholly foolish and <lb/>
            keeping aloof from the divine company, mock the one exist­ <lb/>
            ing or only wise Being, immaculate by nature, saying, in a <lb/>
            tone of vituperation, " Oh the great gift, the governor and <lb/>
            Lord of the whole universe has given one letter, by which <lb/>
            the name of the patriarch was to be increased and become <lb/>
            of great importance, so as to be made a trisyllable instead <lb/>
            of a dissyllable!" Oh the great misery, and wickedness, and <lb/>
            impiety, of such men! If some persons dare, in any respect, <lb/>
            to endeavour to detract from God, being deceived by the <lb/>
            outward appearance of a name, when they ought rather to <lb/>
            thrust their minds down into the depths, and inquire into <lb/>
            the things themselves more closely, on account of the real <lb/>
            magnitude and importance of the possession.</p>
          <p>Besides this, why do ye not think the concession of one <lb/>
            letter, although a small and easy gift, nevertheless an act of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            providence ? and why do ye not weigh its value ? since, <lb/>
            above all things, the very first element of language, as ex­ <lb/>
            pressed in letters, is A, both in order and in virtue. In the <lb/>
            second place, it is also a vowel, and the very first of vowels, <lb/>
            being placed above them as their head. In the third place, <lb/>
            because it does not belong to long properties, nor to short <lb/>
            properties, but it is of the number of those which comprise <lb/>
            each characteristic, for it is extended into greater length, <lb/>
            and then again it is recalled into shortness, by reason of its <lb/>
            softness, resembling wax, and being figured into many <lb/>
            shapes, and afterwards figuring words, according to infinite <lb/>
            numbers ; besides all this it is a cause, for it is the brother <lb/>
            of unity, from which all things begin and in which all <lb/>
            things terminate.</p>
          <p>Therefore, when any one sees such great beauty, and a <lb/>
            letter set forth with such great importance and necessity, <lb/>
            how can he accuse it as if he had not seen this ? for if he <lb/>
            has seen it, he then shows himself to be a person of insult­ <lb/>
            ing disposition and a hater of what is good; and if he has <lb/>
            not seen a fact, which is so easy to comprehend, how does <lb/>
            he presume to ridicule and despise that which he does not <lb/>
            understand as if he did understand it ? But however these <lb/>
            things may be said by the way, as I stated before. But we <lb/>
            must now examine into its necessary and most important <lb/>
            task.</p>
          <p>The addition of the letter A, by one single element, <lb/>
            changed and reformed the whole character of the mind, <lb/>
            causing it, instead of the sublime knowledge and learning <lb/>
            of sublime things, that is to say, instead of astronomy, to <lb/>
            acquire a comprehension of wisdom, since it is by the <lb/>
            knowledge of things above that the faculty is acquired of <lb/>
            mounting up to one portion of the world, that is to say, to <lb/>
            heaven, and to the periodical revolutions and motions of the <lb/>
            stars; but wisdom has reference to the nature of all things, <lb/>
            both such as are visible to the outward senses, and such as <lb/>
            are appreciable only by the intellect, for the intellect is the <lb/>
            wisdom which gives a knowledge of divine and human <lb/>
            things and of their principles.</p>
          <p>Therefore, in divine things there is something which is <lb/>
            visible, and something else which is invisible, and a demon­ <lb/>
            strative idea. And in human affairs there are some things <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            which are corporeal and some which are incorporeal; to <lb/>
            attain to the right comprehension of which is a great task, <lb/>
            and a real employment for the abilities and courage of man. <lb/>
            But to be able, not only to behold the substances and <lb/>
            natures of the universe, but also the principles which regu­ <lb/>
            late each separate fact, indicates a virtue more perfect than <lb/>
            that which is allotted to mankind; for it is necessary for <lb/>
            the mind, which perceives so many and such great things, <lb/>
            to be altogether and wholly eye, and to dispense with sleep, <lb/>
            passing its whole existence in the world in a state of inces­ <lb/>
            sant wakefulness, and being surrounded by a light which <lb/>
            knows no darkness, and which exhibits the appearance of <lb/>
            light itself as by an ever-flashing lightning, taking God for <lb/>
            its leader and guide, to the comprehension of the know­ <lb/>
            ledge of those things which are, and to the faculty of <lb/>
            explaining their principles.</p>
          <p>Therefore the dissyllabic name Abram is explained as <lb/>
            meaning " excellent father," on account of his affinity to the <lb/>
            knowledge of sublime wisdom, that is, astronomy and mathe­ <lb/>
            matics. But the trisyllabic name Abraham is interpreted <lb/>
            " the father of elect sound," being the name of a really wise <lb/>
            man; for what else is sound in us, except the utterance of <lb/>
            a pronounced word ? for which object we have an instru­ <lb/>
            ment constructed by nature, passing through the thick tube <lb/>
            of the throat, and united with the mouth and tongue; and <lb/>
            the father of such a sound is our intellect, and elect intellect <lb/>
            is endued with virtue.</p>
          <p>But if we are to keep to exact propriety, then it is plain <lb/>
            that the mind is the familiar and natural father of the <lb/>
            uttered word, because it is the especial property of the <lb/>
            father to beget, and the word is born from the mind; and <lb/>
            it will be a certain proof of this if we recollect that when it <lb/>
            is set in motion by counsels it sounds, and when they are <lb/>
            absent it ceases to sound: and the evidences of this are the <lb/>
            rhetoricians and philosophers who demonstrate its habit by <lb/>
            objects; for whenever the mind publishes abroad different <lb/>
            heads of designs, and in the manner of a mother about to <lb/>
            bring forth produces each individual means previously <lb/>
            stored up in itself, then also the word, flowing forth like a <lb/>
            fountain, is borne to the ears of the bystander as to its <lb/>
            appropriate receptacles: but when those are wanting, then <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            it also is unable to publish itself further, and rests, and the <lb/>
            sound is inactive as being struck by no one.</p>
          <p>Now therefore, 0 ye men, full and crammed with super­ <lb/>
            fluous loquacity, ye men devoid of wisdom, does not the gift <lb/>
            of one single element appear to you to have been such that <lb/>
            by the intervention of a single letter the wise man is ren­ <lb/>
            dered worthy of the divine attribute of wisdom, than which <lb/>
            there is nothing more excellent in our nature ? because <lb/>
            instead of the sublime erudition of astronomy he gave him <lb/>
            intellect, that is to say, instead of a small part of wisdom, he <lb/>
            gave him the whole and perfect blessing of entire wisdom, <lb/>
            since a knowledge of things above is included and compre­ <lb/>
            hended in wisdom, as a part is included in the whole ; for <lb/>
            mathematics are only a part.</p>
          <p>But it becomes you, 0 men, to consider this point also, that <lb/>
            the man who is well instructed and skilful in the investiga­ <lb/>
            tion of the nature of things above may by possibility be a <lb/>
            man of depraved and wicked habits; but the wise man is <lb/>
            altogether approved as virtuous. Shall we then now any <lb/>
            longer ridicule this gift, than which nothing more excellent <lb/>
            can be found ? For what is more shameful than wicked­ <lb/>
            ness or more excellent than virtue ? Can anything be <lb/>
            found here not good, and is it not wholly opposed to evil ? <lb/>
            Or can this gift be compared to riches, or honour, or liberty, <lb/>
            or health, or to any other superfluous possession of any kind <lb/>
            around or exterior to the body ?</p>
          <p>For the whole of philosophy is thus added to our life as a <lb/>
            sort of college of medicine to the soul, in order from thence <lb/>
            to dispense to it freedom from suffering and immunity from <lb/>
            disease ; but in truth it is noble to be a philosopher, and <lb/>
            that wonderful knowledge is truly noble; and the end is <lb/>
            even more admirable, on account of which the act is called <lb/>
            into existence.</p>
          <p>Here therefore is wisdom, and that the best kind of wis­ <lb/>
            dom, which God called in the Chaldaic dialect Abraham, <lb/>
            namely the father of elect sound, giving as it were a defi­ <lb/>
            nition of a wise man; for as the definition of man is a <lb/>
            mortal animal endowed with reason, so also the mysterious <lb/>
            definition of a wise man is the father of elect sound.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, "I will greatly increase thee, and <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            set thee among the nations, and kings shall proceed from <lb/>
            thee ?" *</p>
          <p>44. That expression, "I will greatly increase thee," was <lb/>
            used to the wise man with exceeding propriety ; since every <lb/>
            wicked or bad man does increase and advance, not to <lb/>
            improvement but towards deficiency; as withering flowers <lb/>
            advance not towards life but towards death; but the man <lb/>
            whose life is extended long and is greatly increased is like a <lb/>
            passing cloud, or like the continually flowing stream of a <lb/>
            river, because as it increases it is extended more and more <lb/>
            out of doors, as its wisdom also is divine.</p>
          <p>And that expression, " I will set thee among the nations," <lb/>
            was used in order that God might the more evidently <lb/>
            demonstrate that he was making him worthy to be as a <lb/>
            foundation and firm support to the nations through his <lb/>
            wisdom, not only to his own nation, but also to all other <lb/>
            peoples who in various manners are in want in respect of <lb/>
            their minds, as has been said before; since the wise man is <lb/>
            the redeemer of nations and intercessor for them before <lb/>
            God, and since it is he who implores pardon for the sins of <lb/>
            his relations.</p>
          <p>Last of all, the promise, " Kings shall come forth from <lb/>
            thee," is again used with especial propriety; for everything <lb/>
            which relates to wisdom is a royal seed; the offspring of the <lb/>
            chief and master according to nature: but the wise man has <lb/>
            no seed or fruit of his own, but is fertile and abundant in <lb/>
            the seed which proceeds from the great cause himself.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " I will give this land to thee and <lb/>
            to thy seed after thee, in which thou hast sojourned, namely <lb/>
            all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession ?"t</p>
          <p>45. The letter of the promise is so clear that the lan­ <lb/>
            guage does not stand in need of any explanation whatever; <lb/>
            but with respect to the inward meaning of it we must have <lb/>
            recourse to an allegory of this kind.</p>
          <p>The mind which is endowed with virtue is rather a <lb/>
            sojourner in the corporeal space allotted to it, than a regu­ <lb/>
            lar inhabitant of it; for its real country is the air and the <lb/>
            heaven; and the earth, and the earthly body in which it is <lb/>
            said to sojourn, is only a colony; therefore the Father, con­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 6 </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xvii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            ferring a benefit upon it, gives to it the sovereign authority <lb/>
            over all the things of the earth for ever and ever, as he <lb/>
            says himself, for an everlasting possession; so that it for the <lb/>
            future shall not be governed by the body, but shall always <lb/>
            be its master and ruler, having the body for its servant and <lb/>
            attendant.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " And every male of you shall be <lb/>
            circumcised, and you shall circumcise, or you shall be cir­ <lb/>
            cumcised in, the flesh of your foreskin ? "*</p>
          <p>46. I see here a twofold circumcision, one of the male <lb/>
            creature, and the other of the flesh ; that which is of the <lb/>
            flesh takes place in the genitals, but that which is of the <lb/>
            male creature takes place, as it seems to me, in respect of <lb/>
            his thoughts.</p>
          <p>Since that which is, properly speaking, masculine in us is <lb/>
            the intellect, the superfluous shoots of which it is necessary <lb/>
            to prune away and to cast off, so that it, becoming clean and <lb/>
            pure from all wickedness and vile, may worship God as his <lb/>
            priest.</p>
          <p>This therefore is what is designated by the second cir­ <lb/>
            cumcision, where God says by an express law, " Circumcise <lb/>
            the hardlless of your hearts," that is to say, your hard and <lb/>
            rebellious thoughts and ambition, which when they are cut <lb/>
            away and removed from you, your most important part will <lb/>
            be rendered free.</p>
          <p>Why orders he the males only to be circumcised ? t</p>
          <p>47. For in the first place, the Egyptians, in accordance <lb/>
            with the national customs of their country, in the fourteenth <lb/>
            year of their age, when the male begins to have the power of <lb/>
            propagating his species, and when the female arrives at the <lb/>
            age of puberty, circumcise both bride and bridegroom.</p>
          <p>But the divine legislator appoints circumcision to take <lb/>
            place in the case of the male alone for many reasons : the <lb/>
            first of which is, that the male creature feels venereal plea­ <lb/>
            sures and desires matrimonial connexions more than the <lb/>
            female, on which account the female is properly omitted <lb/>
            here, while he checks the superfluous impetuosity of the <lb/>
            male by the sign of circumcision. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 10. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvii. 11. </note> <pb n="449"/>
            </p>
          <p>But the second reason is, that the material of the female <lb/>
            is supplied to the son from what remains over of the eruption <lb/>
            of blood, while the immediate maker and cause of the son is <lb/>
            the male. Because therefore the male supplies the most <lb/>
            indispensable part in the act of generation, God deservedly <lb/>
            represses his pride by the figure of circumcision, but the <lb/>
            material or feminine cause, as being inactive, does not display <lb/>
            ambition in the same degree. And this is enough to say on <lb/>
            this head.</p>
          <p>But afterwards we must note this likewise, that the <lb/>
            intellect in us is endued with the power of sight, therefore <lb/>
            it is necessary to cut away its superfluous shoots. And <lb/>
            these superfluous shoots are empty opinions, and all the <lb/>
            actions which are done in accordance with them. So that <lb/>
            the intellect after circumcision may only bear about with <lb/>
            itself what is necessary and useful; and that whatever <lb/>
            causes pride to increase may be cut away; with which also <lb/>
            the eyes are circumcised as if they did not see.</p>
          <p>Why did he say, " And let the child, every male child, be <lb/>
            circumcised at eight days old ? " *</p>
          <p>48. He orders the freeborn to be circumcised, which, in <lb/>
            the first place, was permitted on account of diseases that <lb/>
            might arise ; for it is more difficult to heal a disease in the <lb/>
            genitals, and it is commonly done by burning by fire those <lb/>
            parts over which a membrane grows, but this rarely affects <lb/>
            those who have been circumcised.</p>
          <p>And in truth, if it were possible that other infirmities also <lb/>
            could be avoided by amputating any member or any part <lb/>
            of the body, so that though it was amputated still the ope­ <lb/>
            ration of each necessary part would not be hindered, then <lb/>
            without the knowledge of mortal man he would be transmit­ <lb/>
            ted into immortality.</p>
          <p>But that here it was thought fit that man should be cir­ <lb/>
            cumcised out of a provident care for his mind without any <lb/>
            previous infirmity is plain, since not the Jews alone, but <lb/>
            also the Egyptians, and Arabians, and Ethiopians, and nearly <lb/>
            all the nations who live in the southern parts of the world, <lb/>
            down to the torrid zone are circumcised.</p>
          <p>What then is the chief reason of this feet ? except that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. IT </note> <note type="footnote"> GG </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            in those districts, and especially in the summer, when the <lb/>
            genitals are protected with a skin, it burns and is injured by <lb/>
            inflammation, but when that covering is laid bare by circum­ <lb/>
            cision it is cooled, and the disease is repelled; and on this <lb/>
            account the northern nations and others, to whom the cooler <lb/>
            portion of the habitable earth has been allotted, are not <lb/>
            circumcised, for not only is the solar heat moderate in those <lb/>
            regions, but so is also all inflammatory disease which affects <lb/>
            the membranes of the members. Let every one take a firm <lb/>
            judgment, and from that time when the disease comes in <lb/>
            more vigorously; for it never comes at all in the winter, but <lb/>
            in the summer it shows itself and flourishes and ripens; for <lb/>
            it loves, if I may so say, like fire to burn in those parts.</p>
          <p>* In the second place, it was not only from a regard to <lb/>
            sound health that our ancestors diligently employed this <lb/>
            method of cure, but also from a regard to the multiplication <lb/>
            of the human race, seeing that nature was very vivacious and <lb/>
            too eager to propagate the human species.</p>
          <p>Therefore they knew, like wise men, how the seed when <lb/>
            poured over the folds of the membrane is often accustomed <lb/>
            to be wasted and so to become unfruitful; but if no impedi­ <lb/>
            ment arises then it would easily be able to arrive at the <lb/>
            situation suited to receive it. On which account also those <lb/>
            nations which adopt the practice of circumcision have grown <lb/>
            into an exceedingly numerous population: and our legislator, <lb/>
            weighing the consequences also, commanded the circumcision <lb/>
            of infants to be performed at an earlier age, keeping in view <lb/>
            the same effect of circumcision with regard to the popula­ <lb/>
            tion.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is in truth, as it seems to me, that the <lb/>
            Egyptians also in the fourteenth year of their children's age, <lb/>
            in which the desire to propagate the species usually begins, <lb/>
            have said that it is suitable to circumcise them, with the <lb/>
            view of increasing the population; but it was better and <lb/>
            more carefully done in our nation, where the circumcision <lb/>
            of infants was ordained, since perhaps the man when grown <lb/>
            up would delay the operation out of fear, because he then has <lb/>
            a will of his own.</p>
          <p>In the third place, he says this with a view to cleanliness <lb/>
            in the sacred oblations; for in truth those who enter into <lb/>
            the courts of the temples are made clean by sprinkling and <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            ablutions. Moreover the Egyptians scrape the whole body, <lb/>
            removing all the hairs which cover and envelop the body, so <lb/>
            as to appear white all over; but the circumcision of the <lb/>
            skin is no small assistance towards cleanliness, otherwise <lb/>
            everyone would abhor it when he beheld it as it is in itself.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place, there are in us two generative prin­ <lb/>
            ciples, one in the soul and one in the body; the generative <lb/>
            principle of the soul is the intellect, and that of the body is the <lb/>
            corporeal organ; therefore the ancients chose to refer the <lb/>
            generative principle of the body to an imitation of the intellect <lb/>
            which is rather the generative principle of the heart. And in <lb/>
            truth there is nothing to which it is found more like than <lb/>
            the circumcision of the heart; these therefore are real facts <lb/>
            like the celebrated reasons for things which have been inves­ <lb/>
            tigated. But we must now speak of those which have greater <lb/>
            symbols belonging to them and which exhibit a certain <lb/>
            principle.</p>
          <p>Therefore the circumcision of the skin is said to be a <lb/>
            symbol, but as one indicating that it is proper to cut away <lb/>
            all superfluous and extravagant desires, by studying conti­ <lb/>
            nence and religion; for as the skin of the prepuce is quite <lb/>
            superfluous for generation, and is moreover especially <lb/>
            injurious by reason of the disease of inflammation which burns <lb/>
            within it, so also an over abundance of desire is as super­ <lb/>
            fluous as it is pernicious, superfluous because it is not <lb/>
            necessary, and pernicious because it is the cause of diseases <lb/>
            to both body and soul; and by the greater desire he also <lb/>
            warns us that all the other desires are likewise to be cut <lb/>
            off. And that is called the greater desire which has a regard <lb/>
            to the matrimonial connexion of the male and the female ; <lb/>
            since it is the beginning of a great thing, namely, of gene­ <lb/>
            rating ; and since it creates a great affection on the part of <lb/>
            the father towards her who is to bring forth ; for it is <lb/>
            natural for them both to be influenced by love and affection <lb/>
            for their offspring. Therefore, he here warns us to cut away <lb/>
            not only all the superfluous desires, but also pride, as being <lb/>
            a great wickedness and an associate of wickedness.</p>
          <p>For pride, as the language of the ancients tells us, is <lb/>
            what keeps men back and hinders them in their im­ <lb/>
            provement ; since it will not exhibit that honesty which <lb/>
            it really possesses, thinking that it is itself an adequate <note type="footnote"> G G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            cause for anything. Moreover it naturally influences those <lb/>
            who think themselves the causes of generation; so that <lb/>
            they scarcely ever turn their minds at all to behold the <lb/>
            true Father of the universe. For he is in truth the one real <lb/>
            and genuine Father of all; and we, who are called fathers, <lb/>
            are only instruments of his, serving to generation; since, <lb/>
            as in a wonderful resemblance, all things which are repre­ <lb/>
            sented in appearance are yet in reality inanimate, but that <lb/>
            which strengthens the nerves is invisible, and yet is itself the <lb/>
            cause of virtue, and of motion, and of sight. So, in like <lb/>
            manner, from everlasting and invisible space there extends <lb/>
            the Creator of the universe, and we, like so many pup­ <lb/>
            pets, are strengthened by him with nerves for the purpose <lb/>
            which belongs to us, namely, sowing seed and raising a <lb/>
            generation ; unless we choose to fancy that a flute is blown <lb/>
            by itself, and is not made by an artist in a way adapted <lb/>
            for the production of harmony, by whom it was constructed <lb/>
            as an instrument for service and for its own necessary end.</p>
          <p>Why does he order circumcision to be performed on the <lb/>
            eighth day?*</p>
          <p>49. The number eight has many beauties in it; for it is, <lb/>
            in the first place, a cubic number. Secondly, it has beauties, <lb/>
            because it everywhere contains in itself the form of equality, <lb/>
            because longitude, and breadth, and depth, which are all <lb/>
            equal to one another, are indicated by the first number <lb/>
            eight.</p>
          <p>In the third place, the composition of the number <lb/>
            eight produces agreement, namely, the number thirty-six, <lb/>
            which the Pythagoreans call agreement, since that is the <lb/>
            first number in which odd numbers being added together <lb/>
            agree with even numbers. If, indeed, four odd numbers <lb/>
            from the unit are separately taken and added together and <lb/>
            four even numbers beginning with two, they united make <lb/>
            thirty-six. Now the odd numbers are these: one, three, <lb/>
            five, seven, which make sixteen. And the even numbers <lb/>
            are these: two, four, six, eight, which make twenty. And <lb/>
            the addition of the two together makes thirty-six, which is <lb/>
            in truth a more fertile number.</p>
          <p>Since it is a square, having each side composed of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="453"/>
            number six; the first of which is both odd and even; which <lb/>
            some persons most correctly call harmony or matrimony; <lb/>
            and it was by the employment of this number that the Cre­ <lb/>
            ator of the universe made the world, as the holy and admirable <lb/>
            book of Moses relates.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place, the idea of eight produces sixty- <lb/>
            four, which is the first number, which is a cube and also a <lb/>
            square, being the type of incorporeal substance appreciable <lb/>
            only by the intellect and invisible, and also of corporeal <lb/>
            substance. Of incorporeal substance, inasmuch as it produces <lb/>
            superficies according to the square; and of corporeal sub­ <lb/>
            stance, as producing a solid according to the cube.</p>
          <p>In the fifth place, it is always a kindred number to the <lb/>
            virgin number seven, for seven makes up the parts of eight; <lb/>
            because four is the half of it, two is the fourth part of it, one <lb/>
            the eighth of it, and four, two, and one, added together, <lb/>
            make seven.</p>
          <p>In the sixth place, the power of eight is sixty-four, which <lb/>
            we call the first number, being both a cube and a square.</p>
          <p>In the seventh place, taken separately from the units by <lb/>
            these doubled numbers, one, two, four, eight, sixteen, <lb/>
            thirty-two, the sum makes sixty-four.</p>
          <p>And the number eight has also other more distinguished <lb/>
            virtues still, which we have enumerated in another place; <lb/>
            but now it seems better to explain the principle which cor­ <lb/>
            responds to the present question, and which depends on the <lb/>
            grounds now laid down.</p>
          <p>But in the first place we must premise this: that nation <lb/>
            to whom it is enjoined, having the commandments given to <lb/>
            it, that it should be circumcised on the eighth day, is called <lb/>
            in the Chaldaic language Israel, that is to say, “ he that <lb/>
            seeth by day." Therefore God wills, in the first place, that <lb/>
            he should be a partaker both of his own just rights, and also <lb/>
            of those which exist according to election, and according to <lb/>
            the principle of Genesis (or creation), by that first number <lb/>
            six, which immediately followed the creation. This number, <lb/>
            in fact, the Father and Creator of all things evidently <lb/>
            exhibited to the world as the festival of generation, com­ <lb/>
            pleting the world on the sixth day. And the other number, <lb/>
            that which is according to election, he exhibited by the <lb/>
            number eight, which is the beginning of the second seven; <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            as eight is seven and one, so the race which has been <lb/>
            honoured is always a race receiving that number also in ad­ <lb/>
            dition, so that it should be elect, both by nature and in <lb/>
            accordance with the decree of the Father.</p>
          <p>In the second place, the number eight exhibits equality <lb/>
            everywhere, showing that all its separations are equal, as <lb/>
            has been aleady said, I mean its length, and breadth, and <lb/>
            depth. And equality it is which is the parent of equity <lb/>
            and justice, by which he shows that the nation which loves <lb/>
            God is adorned with equity or justice, and has advanced to <lb/>
            complete possession.</p>
          <p>In the third place, eight is not only a measure of com­ <lb/>
            plete equity in all its dimensions, but is the very first <lb/>
            number that is so, for it is the first cube; since the number <lb/>
            eight indicates equality, and so it has the second and not <lb/>
            the first rank: therefore it demonstrates in a symbolical <lb/>
            manner that that nature Was the first which was ever com­ <lb/>
            pletely furnished with consummate and perfect equity and <lb/>
            justice, and that it is the first nature of the human race, not <lb/>
            in point of creation or of time, but in the dignity of virtue, <lb/>
            as if justice united with equality were a connatural part <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place, since there are four elements, the ap­ <lb/>
            pearances of earth, water, air, and fire; fire has received <lb/>
            for its figure a shape becoming a similar name, a pyramid;* <lb/>
            and air has received for its figure an eight-sided one; water, <lb/>
            a twenty-sided one; and the earth, a cube. Therefore he <lb/>
            thought it necessary that the earth, which was to be the <lb/>
            allotment of the race of man, who were endowed with virtue, <lb/>
            should participate in the cubic number, as the whole earth <lb/>
            has been formed in its figure. And a part of it receives the <lb/>
            parts of that which should bring forth, because by nature <lb/>
            the earth is very fertile, producing all the various and <lb/>
            distinct species of every kind of animal and plant.</p>
          <p>Why does he order all slaves to be circumcised, those <lb/>
            born in the family and also those who are bought ?+</p>
          <p>50. The literal meaning is plain; for it is fitting that <lb/>
            servants should imitate their masters on account of their <note type="footnote"> * <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυϱαμὶς</foreign>, resembling the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">πυ̃ϱ</foreign>, “fire.” </note><note type="footnote"> † Genesis xvii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            necessary employment, and the services to which they are <lb/>
            bound in life. But with respect to the inner object of the <lb/>
            command, those dispositions are what may be called born in <lb/>
            the family which are influenced by nature itself, and those <lb/>
            are bought which can be changed for the better by teaching <lb/>
            and instruction. Each of these has its appropriate employ­ <lb/>
            ment, and requires like a plant to be cleared and pruned in <lb/>
            order that the good and fruitful parts may acquire constancy; <lb/>
            for fertile plants produce many superfluous things by reason <lb/>
            of their fecundity, and those superfluities must be cut away; <lb/>
            but those who are taught by instructors cut away their <lb/>
            ignorance.</p>
          <p>What is the meaning of, " And it shall be my covenant <lb/>
            (or agreement) in your flesh ? " *</p>
          <p>51. God is willing to do good, not only to the man who is <lb/>
            endued with virtue, but he wishes that the divine word <lb/>
            should regulate not only his soul but his body also, as if it <lb/>
            had become its physician. And it must be its care to prune <lb/>
            away all excesses of seeing, and hearing, and taste, and <lb/>
            smell, and touch, and also those of the instrument of voice <lb/>
            and articulation, and also all the redundant and pernicious <lb/>
            impulses of the genitals, as also of the whole body, the effect <lb/>
            of which is, that at times we are delighted by our passions <lb/>
            and at times pained by them.</p>
          <p>Why is it that he pronounces a sentence of death on an <lb/>
            infant, saying, " Every male child who is not circumcised, <lb/>
            who has not been circumcised (or, as the Greek has it, who <lb/>
            shall not be circumcised) in the flesh of his foreskin on the <lb/>
            eighth day, that soul shall be cut off from his generation? " t</p>
          <p>52. The law never declares a man guilty for any un­ <lb/>
            intentional offence ; since even those who have committed <lb/>
            an unintentional homicide are pardoned by it, cities being <lb/>
            set apart into which such men may flee and there find <lb/>
            security; for whoever escapes to them is rendered secure <lb/>
            and free from danger; and no one has the power to drag <lb/>
            him forth, or to cite him before the tribunal of the judge for <lb/>
            the deed.</p>
          <p>Therefore, if a boy is not circumcised on the eighth day <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 13. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xvii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            after his birth, what offence will he have committed that he <lb/>
            is to be held guilty, and suffer the penalty of death ?</p>
          <p>Some persons may perhaps say that the form of the <lb/>
            command points to the parents themselves, for they look <lb/>
            upon them as despisers of the command of the law. But <lb/>
            others say that it has here exerted excessive severity against <lb/>
            infants, as it seems, imposing this heavy penalty in order <lb/>
            that grown up persons who break the law may thus be <lb/>
            irrevocably subjected to most severe punishment. This is <lb/>
            the literal effect of the words.</p>
          <p>But if we look to their inward meaning, then what is male <lb/>
            in us is most especially the intellect, and that God here <lb/>
            commands to be circumcised on the eighth day, for the <lb/>
            reason previously stated, not in any other part, but in the <lb/>
            flesh of the foreskin, by this expression symbolically indi­ <lb/>
            cating those parts which in the flesh do subsequently <lb/>
            become the organs of pleasure and impulse. And on this <lb/>
            account it is that he introduces a legitimate reason, warning <lb/>
            men that the intellect, which is not circumcised and cleared <lb/>
            away from the flesh and the vices of the flesh, is corrupt and <lb/>
            cannot be saved.</p>
          <p>But that this language is not to be applied to the man, <lb/>
            but to the intellect, which is thus put in a sound condition, <lb/>
            he tells us in the subsequent words, saying, " that soul shall <lb/>
            be cut off," not that human body, or that man, but that <lb/>
            soul and mind. Cut off from what? From its generation ; <lb/>
            for the whole generation is incorrupt. Therefore the wicked <lb/>
            man is removed from incorruption to corruption.</p>
          <p>Why does God say, " Sara thy wife shall not be called <lb/>
            Sara, but Sarra shall be her name ? " *</p>
          <p>53. Here again some foolish persons may laugh at the <lb/>
            addition of one single letter, that is to say, of a hundred, <lb/>
            for in Greek characters the letter g means a hundred; but <lb/>
            if they jest in this way they are foolish, as being unwilling <lb/>
            to behold the inward merits of things and to cleave to the <lb/>
            footsteps of truth; for that element, <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϱ</foreign>, which is here <lb/>
            thought of merely as the addition of one letter, is the <lb/>
            parent of all harmony, making things great instead of small, <lb/>
            general instead of particular, and mortal instead of im­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 15 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            mortal; since Sara, when called Sara with one g, is inter­ <lb/>
            preted " thy princedom," but with two g's, Sarra, " princess." <lb/>
            Let us then be careful, and see how these two names are <lb/>
            distinguished from one another. In me wisdom (or <lb/>
            prudence), integrity (or temperance), justice, and fortitude <lb/>
            have only a prince-like power and are mortal; moreover, <lb/>
            when I die they die too.</p>
          <p>But this wisdom is herself a princess, and justice is a <lb/>
            prince too, and each separate one of these virtues is not the <lb/>
            principal or princely part in me, but is itself a mistress and <lb/>
            a queen, an everlasting monarchy and sovereignty. Do you <lb/>
            not now see the magnitude of the gift ? By this slight <lb/>
            change, God changes the part into the whole, the species <lb/>
            into the genus, the corruptible into the incorruptible. And <lb/>
            all these things are previously dispensed on account of the <lb/>
            impending birth of a more perfect joy than all joys, whose <lb/>
            name is Isaac.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, " And from her I will give thee child­ <lb/>
            ren, and I will bless him, and he shall be over the nations, <lb/>
            and kings of the nations shall come forth from him ? " *</p>
          <p>54. It is scarcely proper to inquire why he has said <lb/>
            children in the plural number, when he meant their only <lb/>
            and beloved son; for the intention of God's words applies <lb/>
            to his offspring, from which nations and kings should arise.</p>
          <p>This is the literal meaning of the words. But if we look <lb/>
            to their more inward sense, when the soul possesses that <lb/>
            virtue, small and mortal as it is, which is only particular, <lb/>
            she is still barren. But from the time that it acquires a <lb/>
            share of the divine and incorruptible virtue, it begins to <lb/>
            conceive and to bring forth varieties of nations, namely, of <lb/>
            all other holy and sacred persons ; for every one of the ever­ <lb/>
            lasting virtues is subject to an immense number of voluntary <lb/>
            laws, which bear in themselves a similarity to nations and <lb/>
            kingdoms ; for virtue and the generations of virtue are royal <lb/>
            things, being previously instructed by nature what it is <lb/>
            which rejoices in princely power, and has no knowledge of a <lb/>
            servile condition.</p>
          <p>Why did Abraham fall on his face and laugh ? t <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 16. </note><note type="footnote">+ Genesis xvii. IT. </note> <pb n="458"/>
            </p>
          <p>55. Two things are indicated by his falling on his face. One <lb/>
            an act of adoration on account of the excess of his divine <lb/>
            ecstacy; the other that it corresponds to and is suitable to <lb/>
            the aforesaid harmony, by which the intellect has confessed <lb/>
            that God alone exists in a continual and unvarying exist­ <lb/>
            ence. But those creatures which owe their existence to <lb/>
            creation and generation, all are subject to changes in time; <lb/>
            for they fall to a certain extent, inasmuch as they are <lb/>
            accustomed to rise up, and to be corrected in accordance <lb/>
            with their original appearance.</p>
          <p>And it was very natural for Abraham to laugh at the <lb/>
            promise, as he was then filled with the great hope that the <lb/>
            things which he expected should be accomplished, especially <lb/>
            because he had received a manifest revelation from that <lb/>
            appearance, by which he became more thoroughly acquainted <lb/>
            with him who exists for everlasting without variation, and <lb/>
            with him also who is continually stooping and falling.</p>
          <p>Why did Abraham appear to hesitate about the promise, <lb/>
            for the sacred writer says, He said in his mind, shall there <lb/>
            be a son to one who is a hundred years old; and shall <lb/>
            Sarra, who is ninety years old, bring forth a child ?*</p>
          <p>56. This expression, "he said in his mind," is not added <lb/>
            without an object or gratuitously, for words which are <lb/>
            articulated in the tongue and the mouth incur guilt, and <lb/>
            become liable to punishment, but those which are restrained <lb/>
            within the mind are not liable to punishment, because the <lb/>
            mind without any intention on its part is led away by <lb/>
            irregularities, all kinds of passions being introduced from <lb/>
            different quarters, which it for a while resists, being in­ <lb/>
            dignant at them, and wishing to keep aloof from their <lb/>
            representations.</p>
          <p>But perhaps we should not say that he hesitated, but <lb/>
            rather that he was struck by wonderment at the amazing <lb/>
            nature of the gift, and so said, " Behold my body is ad­ <lb/>
            vanced in years, and has passed the age of generation; <lb/>
            nevertheless all things are possible to God, so that he may <lb/>
            transmute old age into youth, and lead those who have no <lb/>
            seed nor fruit to fertility and generation: and if a man who <lb/>
            is a hundred years and a woman who is ninety years old <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxii. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            become parents, all common-place occurrences and all <lb/>
            regularity of nature will be done away, and it will be <lb/>
            clearly seen that it is only the power and the grace of God."</p>
          <p>But what virtue the number one hundred has must now <lb/>
            be explained.</p>
          <p>In the first place, a hundred is the power of the number <lb/>
            ten.</p>
          <p>In the second place, the number ten thousand is the <lb/>
            power of this number a hundred, and ten thousand is the <lb/>
            brother of the unit, for as one times one is one, so ten <lb/>
            thousand times one is ten thousand.</p>
          <p>In the third place, every part of the number a hundred is <lb/>
            honourable.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place, this number consists of thirty-six <lb/>
            and sixty-four, which is a cube, and at the same time a <lb/>
            triangle.</p>
          <p>In the fifth place, it is composed of all these separate odd <lb/>
            numbers: one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, <lb/>
            fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, which added together make a <lb/>
            hundred.</p>
          <p>In the sixth place, it is composed of these four numbers : <lb/>
            one and its double, and four and its double; as one, two, <lb/>
            four, eight, which make fifteen, and of these four numbers <lb/>
            also added together, one, four, fifteen, sixty-four, which <lb/>
            make eighty-five. And the principle of doubling pervades <lb/>
            all these numbers, containing that principle which is by <lb/>
            fours and by fives: and the principle of four times and <lb/>
            twice pervades them all.</p>
          <p>In the seventh place, it is composed of five numbers <lb/>
            taken simply, one, two, three, four, which make ten; and of <lb/>
            five triangular numbers, one, three, six, ten, which make <lb/>
            twenty; and of five quadrangular numbers, one, four, nine, <lb/>
            sixteen, which make thirty; and of five quinquangular <lb/>
            numbers, one, five, twelve, twenty-two, which make forty: <lb/>
            and all these added together make a hundred.</p>
          <p>In the eighth place, it is composed of four cubes taken <lb/>
            simply beginning with the unit, for after giving one, two, <lb/>
            three, four, their cubes one, eight, twenty-seven, sixty-four, <lb/>
            make a hundred.</p>
          <p>In the ninth place, it is divided into forty and sixty, each <lb/>
            of which is a very natural number; and in accordance with <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            the first order of decimals up to ten thousand in a quin­ <lb/>
            quanguiar figure the number a hundred holds the middle <lb/>
            place; for instance: one, ten, a hundred, one thousand, ten <lb/>
            thousand, where a hundred is the middle number of one, ten, <lb/>
            a hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand.</p>
          <p>But we ought also not to pass over in silence the number <lb/>
            ninety as far as it concerns the visible characters.</p>
          <p>As it seems to me the number ninety is second only to <lb/>
            the number a hundred, inasmuch as the tenth part of it, <lb/>
            that is to say ten, is taken away, since I see that in the law <lb/>
            two-tenths of the first-fruits were set apart, first a tenth of <lb/>
            the whole, secondly a tenth of the remainder, for when a <lb/>
            tenth of the fruits of the earth, of corn, or wine, or oil, is <lb/>
            taken, another tenth is also taken from the remainder; <lb/>
            therefore of these two that which is the first and principal <lb/>
            one is honoured with the greater share ; and in the second <lb/>
            place that which follows it, since the number a hundred of <lb/>
            the years of the wise man comprises both the first-fruits <lb/>
            with which it is consecrated, both the first and the second <lb/>
            kind; but the number ninety of the years of the female <lb/>
            parent, comprehends the second and lesser first-fruits, <lb/>
            namely, the remainder of the first, which is the great one <lb/>
            among the sacred numbers.</p>
          <p>This therefore may be called the first vision in the sacred <lb/>
            law which is familiar; and the other has a general cha­ <lb/>
            racter, for the number ninety is fertile; on which account <lb/>
            also it happens that the woman begins to bring forth in the <lb/>
            ninth month; but the tenth is the sacred and perfect <lb/>
            number; and when the two numbers nine and ten are <lb/>
            multiplied together ninety is made, as being the virtue of <lb/>
            the sacred birth, receiving a fertile generation according to <lb/>
            the number nine, and a holy one according to ten.</p>
          <p>Why did Abraham say to God, 0 may this my son <lb/>
            Ishmael live before thee ?*</p>
          <p>57. In the first place, I do not despair, says he, 0 Lord, <lb/>
            of a better generation, but I believe thy promise : never­ <lb/>
            theless, it would be a sufficient blessing for me for this son <lb/>
            to live who in the meantime is a living son, standing visibly, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. IS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            even though he be not so according to the legitimate blood, <lb/>
            but is only born of a concubine.</p>
          <p>In the second place, that blessing which he is now asking <lb/>
            for is an additional one; for he does not entreat for life <lb/>
            alone for his sons, but for an especial life in God; and we <lb/>
            must suppose that there is nothing more perfect than the <lb/>
            rejoicing in the presence of God with a salutary soundness <lb/>
            of mind, which is equal to immortality.</p>
          <p>In the third place, he by a conjecture intimates that the <lb/>
            divine law, when heard, ought not to be considered enough <lb/>
            if merely heard, but that it ought also to enter more deeply <lb/>
            into the inward man, and to form his principal part; for <lb/>
            that life is worthy of being beheld by the Deity which is <lb/>
            formed in accordance with his word.</p>
          <p>Why does the divine oracle, in the way of intimation, say <lb/>
            to Abraham, Yes, be it so: behold Sarah thy wife shall <lb/>
            also bring forth a son unto thee ? *</p>
          <p>58. The meaning of this sentence is as follows : that <lb/>
            confession and admission, says God, is on my part an <lb/>
            admission of thy wish, being manifestly full of unadulterated <lb/>
            joy; and your faith is not doubtful, but without any hesita­ <lb/>
            tion it has a share of modest awe and reverence ; therefore <lb/>
            that which thou hast received before, as to be done unto <lb/>
            thee on account of thy faith in me, shall certainly be done; <lb/>
            for this is what is meant by yes.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, But behold I will also listen to thee <lb/>
            concerning Ishmael, and I will bless him, and he shall <lb/>
            become the father of twelve nations ?f</p>
          <p>59. God says, I will grant to thee both the first and the <lb/>
            second blessing, that is to say, both the blessings of nature <lb/>
            and the blessings of instruction; by nature that which is <lb/>
            according to the legitimate course of nature, that is Isaac, <lb/>
            and by instruction that which is according to Ishmael, who <lb/>
            is not legitimate: for hearing, when compared with sight, is <lb/>
            like the illegitimate compared with the legitimate, and what <lb/>
            is brought about by instruction is not of the same class <lb/>
            with that which owes its existence to nature ; and the man <lb/>
            who is desirous of encyclical wisdom becomes the father of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii 19. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xvii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            nations, for the encyclical number is a period of twelve days <lb/>
            and years.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, But I will set up my covenant with <lb/>
            Isaac, whom Sarah shall bring forth about this time in the <lb/>
            succeeding year ? *</p>
          <p>60. As in men's wills some persons are set down as heirs, <lb/>
            and some are entered as worthy of gifts which they are to <lb/>
            receive from the heirs, so also in the divine testament that <lb/>
            man is set down as the heir who is by nature a worthy <lb/>
            disciple of God being adorned with all perfect virtues; but <lb/>
            he who is introduced by learning, and is made subject to the <lb/>
            law of wisdom, and partakes in. encyclical instruction, is not <lb/>
            at all an heir, but only a receiver of gifts gratuitously given.</p>
          <p>But it is said with great wisdom and propriety that his <lb/>
            mother shall bring forth Isaac in the succeeding year, since <lb/>
            this birth unto life does not belong to the present time, but <lb/>
            to another great and holy time ; and that which is divine <lb/>
            rejoices in excessive abundance, and is by no means like the <lb/>
            nations of this world.</p>
          <p>Why does he say, Abraham was ninety and nine years old <lb/>
            when he was circumcised, and Ishmael his son was thirteen <lb/>
            years old ? t</p>
          <p>61. The number of ninety and nine years is arranged here <lb/>
            as approximating to the number a hundred. And it is in <lb/>
            accordance with this number that it is arranged that the seed <lb/>
            of the perfect man becomes the beginning of generation, <lb/>
            which appears more evidently in the number a hundred ; but <lb/>
            the number thirteen is composed of the first square numbers <lb/>
            of four and nine, the odd and even numbers; so that the <lb/>
            even number has for its sides a twofold material form; and <lb/>
            the odd number has an operative form, from all which a <lb/>
            triple number is made, which is the greatest and most per­ <lb/>
            feet of the festival victims which the examinations of the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures contain.</p>
          <p>This is one reason. A second also it may be allowed to <lb/>
            us to mention, that the age namely of thirteen years is very <lb/>
            near to and a partaker with the fourteenth year, in which the <lb/>
            motions of seed towards generation begin to have life. In <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 21. </note><note type="footnote">t Genesis xvii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            order, therefore, that no foreign seed should be sown, he <lb/>
            arranged that the first generations should be kept pure, <lb/>
            figuring the instrument of generating under the figure <lb/>
            of generation.</p>
          <p>In the third place, he teaches that he who is about to go <lb/>
            through the operations of matrimony ought by all means <lb/>
            first of all to cut away concupiscence, reproving all las­ <lb/>
            civious and effeminate persons as those who bring together <lb/>
            superfluous mixtures which were not for the sake of the gene­ <lb/>
            ration of children but to gratify incontinent desires.</p>
          <p>Why did Abraham also circumcise strangers?*</p>
          <p>62. The wise man is as useful as the humane man, who <lb/>
            saves and invites to himself not only his relations andn eigh­ <lb/>
            bours, but also strangers and men of another family, giving <lb/>
            them a share of his own habit of patient and religious con­ <lb/>
            tinence ; for these are the foundations of constancy, which <lb/>
            is the object of all virtue, and the point at which it rests. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis mvii. 27. </note></p><pb n="464"/>
