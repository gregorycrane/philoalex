<head>A TREATISE ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.</head>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>We find, then, that in the sacred oracles delivered by the
prophet Moses, there are three separate characters; for a
portion of them relates to the creation of the world, a portion
1s historical, and the third portion is legislative. Now the
creation of the world is related throughout with exceeding
beauty and in a manner admirably suited to the dignity of God,


<note n="456.1"> Leviticus xxvi. 12.
</note>


<pb n="457"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS, 457</note>


taking its beginning in the account of the creation of the
heaven, and ending with that of the formation of man; the
first of which things is the most perfect of all imperishable
things, and the other of all corruptible and perishable things.
And the Creator, connecting together immortal and mortal
things at the creation, made the world, making what he had
already created the dominant parts, and what he was about to
create the subject parts.</p>


<p>The historical part is a record of the lives of different wicked
and virtuous men, and of the rewards, and honours, and
punishments set apart for each class in each generation.</p>


<p>The legislative part is sub-divided into two sections, one of
which has a more general object proposed to it, laying down
accordingly a few general comprehensive laws ; the other part
consists of special and particular ordinances. And the general
heads of these special ordinances are ten, which are said not to
have been delivered to the people by an interpreter, but to
have been fashioned in the lofty region of the air, and to have
been connected by a rational distinctness and utterance. While
the others, I mean the particular and minute laws, were
delivered by the prophet.</p>


<p>And as, in my former treatises, I have dwelt upon each of
these to as great an extent as the time permitted me, and as I
have also enlarged upon all the different virtues which the
lawgiver has assigned to peace and war, I will now proceed in
regular order to mention the rewards which have been proposed
for virtuous men, and the punishments threatened to the
wicked ; for, after he had trained all those who are living under
his constitution and laws by gentle precepts, and admonitions,
and expectations, and subsequently by more severe threats and
warnings, he summoned them all to hear the promulgation of
the law; and they all, coming as to a sacred meeting, displayed
their own eager choice and approbation of those laws in such a
way as to give a most convincing proof of their truth. And
then some of them were found to be diligent labourers in the
practice of virtue, not disappointing the good hopes which were
formed of them, nor dishonouring the laws which were their
instructors. Others were found to be unmanly, and effeminate,
and cowardly, out of the innate weakness and imbecility of their
souls, who, fainting before any real danger or trouble came
upon them, disgraced themselves and became the ridicule of


<pb n="458"/>
<note type="head">458 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


the spectators. On which account the one class received
decisions in their favour, and proclamations in their honour, and
all such rewards as are usually given to conquerors; while the
others departed not only without the garlands of victory, but
even after having sustained a most disgraceful defeat, more
grievous than any which befalls a man in the gymnastic
contests. For there the bodies, indeed, of the athletes are
overthrown, but so that they can be easily raised again ; but in this
case it is the whole life which falls, which, when once it is
overthrown, it is scarcely possible to raise again.</p>


<p>And our lawgiver announces a very suitable arrangement
and appointment of privileges and honours for the one; and,
on the contrary, of punishments for the others, as affecting
individuals, and houses, and cities, and countries, and nations,
and vast regions of the earth.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>And, first of all, we must investigate the subject of
honours, since that is both more profitable and more pleasant
to hear of, taking our commencement from the particular
instances of individuals.</p>


<p>The Greeks say that in ancient times the famous Triptolemus
was raised aloft and borne on winged dragons, and that while
flying along in this manner hé sowed the grains of wneat over
the whole of the earth, in order that, instead of eating acorns,
the human race might for the future have wholesome, and
advantageous, and most pleasant food. This story, then, like
many other tales, being, as it were, a fabulous fiction, may well
be left to those who are accustomed to study sophistry rather
than wisdom, and juggling tricks in preference to the truth;
for originally and simultaneously with the first creation of the
universe, God supplied all living creatures with necessary
food, producing it out of the earth, and, above all things,
providing the race of mankind with all that was requisite,
to whom also he gave the supremacy over every animal born
of the earth. For, among the works of the Deity, there is
nothing posthumous, but all those things which appear
to be brought to perfection at a subsequent time by the care,
and diligence, and skill of men are in all cases previously
produced in a half-finished state by the provident care of nature,
so that it is not a wholly absurd statement that all learning is
only recollection.</p>


<p>However, these questions may be postponed for subsequent


<pb n="459"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 459</note>


discussion. But we must now consider that most necessary of
all things, the sowing of seed, which the Creator has sown in
a very excellent soil, namely, in the rational soul. Now, of
this the most important seed is hope, the fountain of all men’s
lives; for it is by the hope of gain that the money-changer
applies himself to many kinds of traffic; and it is through
hope of a favourable voyage that the sailor passes over long
seas; and it is from hope of glory that the ambitious man
applies himself to public affairs, and to the superintendance of
the commonwealth and matters of state. It is through hope of
decisions in their favour and of crowns, that those who exercise
their bodies in athletic labours enter the gymnastic contests.
Hope is the source of all happiness ; hope excites those persons
who are filled with an admiration of virtue to study philosophy,
under the idea that by her means they will be able to obtain a
clear sight of the nature of all existing things, and to do things
which are in accordance with and consistent with the
perfection of those two most excellent modes of life—the
contemplative and the practical, which he who attains to is at once
truly happy.</p>


<p>Now some persons have either, like enemies, stifled and
destroyed all the seeds of hope by kindling all the vices in
the soul, or else, like persons ignorant of and indifferent to the
skill of the husbandman, they have allowed them to perish
through neglect. There are also some persons who, appearing
to be diligent husbandmen, but who yet, esteeming self-love
above piety, have attributed the causes of their successes to
themselves. And all these men are very blameable, and he
alone is worthy of being accepted who attributes his hope to
God, both as being the author of his birth and as being alone
able to keep him free from injury and free from utter
destruction.</p>


<p>What reward, then, is assigned to the man who is crowned
as conqueror in this contest? Man is a compound animal,
made up of a mortal and immortal nature, not being the same
with nor yet entirely different from the one who has obtained
the prize. This man the Chaldeans name Enos, but this
name, when translated into the Grecian language, means “a
man,” he having received the common name of the whole race
for his own name, as an especial honour; as if it was not right


<pb n="460"/>
<note type="head">460 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


for oy one to be considered as a man at all who does not hope
in God.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>And after the victory of hope there is another contest
in which repentance contends for the prize; having, indeed,
no share in that nature which is invincible, and which never
changes its purpose, and which is always of the same character,
entertaining the same disposition, but which is on a sudden
seized with an admiration for and love of the better part, and
which is anxious to leave the covetousness and injustice in
which it has been bred up, and to go over to moderation and
justice, and the other virtues; for these are twofold prizes,
which are proposed for twofold successes, first of all for the
abandonment of what is disgraceful, and, secondly, for the
choice of what is excellent; and the prizes are a departure
from home, and solitude.</p>


<p>For Moses says, with reference to one who fled from the
audacious innovations of the body, and who came over to the
interests of the soul, “‘ He was not found because God changed
his place;”<ref n="460.1"/> and by this enigmatical expression the two
things are clearly intimated, the migration by the change of
place, and the solitude by his not being found. And very
appropriately is this stated; for if in real truth man had
resolved at all times to show himself really superior to the
passions, despising all pleasures and all appetites, then he
would require to prepare himself diligently, fleeing without
ever turning his head round, and forsaking his home, and his
country, and his relations, and his friends ; for familiar custom
is an attractive thing, so that there is reason to fear that if a
man remains behind he may be taken prisoner, being caught
by such powerful charms all round, the appearances of which
will again rouse up the disgraceful though at present dormant
appetites for evil pursuits, and will restore to vitality those
recollections which it was creditable to have forgotten.</p>


<p>Accordingly, many persons have become corrected and
improved by migrations from their native land, having been
cured ‘by such means of their frenzied and wicked desires, by
reason of the sight no longer being able to furnish to the
passion the images of pleasure. For in consequence of the
separation which has taken place, this passion has only,


<note n="460.1"> Genesis v. 24.
</note>


<pb n="461"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 461</note>


vacuum through which to rove, since there is no longer any
object present by which it can be inflamed. And if it does
rise up and quit its former abode, still let it avoid the
assemblies of the multitude, embracing solitude; for there are
snares in a foreign land resembling those, which are found in
a man’s own country into which those men must fall who are
careless and do not look before them, and who rejoice in the
society of the multitude; for the multitude is a very
concentration of every thing that is irregular, disorderly, improper,
and blameable, with which it is a most mischievous thing for
the man who is now for the first time passing over to the
ranks of virtue to proceed. For as the bodies of those men
who are only just beginning to recover from a long attack of
sickness are very subject to a relapse; so the soul which is
just recovering its health finds its intellectual vigour weak
and wavering, so that there is room to apprehend that the evil
passions may return which were wont to be excited in it by a
habit of living in the society of inconsiderate men.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>Then, after these contests in which repentance is
concermed, he proposes a third class of prizes, relating to justice,
which every one who practises obtains a twofold reward ; in the
first place, that of preservation at the time of general
destruction ; and secondly, that of being the steward and guardian of
every description of animal which is coupled in pairs for the
purpose of raising a second stock instead of that which from time
to time perishes ; for the Creator provided that the same being
should be both the end of the generation which is condemned
and the beginning of that which is irreproachable, teaching
those who say that the world is destitute of all providence by
works and not by words, that in accordance with the law which
he promulgated and established in the nature of things, all
the innumerable multitudes of men which live in obedience to
injustice are not to be compared to one single individual who
lives as a follower of justice.</p>


<p>Now this man the Greeks call Deucalion, but the
Chaldeans name him Noah; and it was in his time that the great
deluge took place. And after this triad there was a second
triad still more holy and more pious, of one family. For
father, and son, and grandson all directed all their views to
the same end of life, namely, to please the Creator and Father
of the universe, despising all those objects which the generality


<pb n="462"/>
<note type="head">462 PHILO JUDZUS,</note>


of men admire; glory, and riches, and pleasure, and laughing
at that pride which is continually being put together and set
forth with all kinds of fictitious ornaments in order to deceive
the spectators. This is that which makes gods of inanimate
things, a great and almost impregnable fortification by the
sophistries and manceuvres of whom every city is allured, and
since it takes especial hold on the souls of the young. For
having entered into them it establishes itself and dwells in
them from the earliest infancy to old age, subduing all those
on whom God has not poured the beams of his truth. But
pride is the adversary of truth, and is hard to be removed,
though when it is subdued by a stronger power than itself
then it does depart.</p>


<p>And this class of men is small, indeed, in number; but in
power it is very numerous and very great, so that even the
whole circle of the earth cannot contain it. And it reaches
even to heaven; for as it is possessed of an indescribable love
of contemplation and of being always among divine objects,
when it has thoroughly investigated and explained all that
nature which is perceptible to the sight, it immediately
proceeds onwards to that which is incorporeal and appreciable
only by the intellect, without requiring the assistance of any
one of the outward senses, indeed discarding even the
irrational parts of the soul, and employing those parts only which
are called mind and reason.</p>


<p>Therefore, the first establisher of the sentiments devoted to
God, namely, Abraham, the first person who passed over from
pride to truth, employing that virtue which proceeds from
instruction as a means towards perfection, chooses as his
reward faith in God. And because he, by the innate goodness
of his natural dispositions, had acquired a spontaneous,
selftaught, and self-implanted virtue, joy was given to him as a
‘prize. Again, to his grandson, the meditator on and practiser
of virtue, who attained to what was good by indefatigable and
incessant labours, the crown which was given was the sight of
God. And what can any one conceive to be either more
useful or more respectable than to believe in God and throughout
one’s whole life to be continually rejoicing and beholding the
living God ?</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>And let us now perceive each of these things more
accurately, without allowing ourselves to be led away by names


<pb n="463"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 463</note>


but investigating them in their inmost parts, and going deep
into them with our minds. Therefore, he who has in all
sincerity believed God has by so doing received a disbelief in
all other things which are created and perishable, beginning
with those things in himself which exalt themselves very
highly, namely, reason and the outward sense. For each of
these things has a private consistory and tribunal of its own,
which is erected in the one in order to ensure the proper consideration of the objects appreciable only by the intellect, the
end of which is truth; and in the other for the perception of
visible things, the end of which is opinion. Therefore, the
unstable, and erroneous, and uutrustworthy character of
opinion is plain from this circumstance; for it anchors upon
images and probabilities. And every image is deceitful,
exhibiting itself by a certain attractive similarity in lieu of the
original thing itself.</p>


<p>But reason, which is the leader of the outward sense,
thinking that the decision about all things which are perceptible
only by the intellect, and which are always the same and in
the same condition, belongs to itself, is convicted of being in
error on many points. . For when it directs its view to particu
cular instances which are innumerable, it finds itself powerless,
and unequal to the task, and faints under it, like a wrestler
who is tripped up by some more mighty power; but the man
to whom it has been granted to see and thoroughly examine
all corporeal and all incorporeal things, and to lean upon and
to found himself upon God alone, with firm and steadfast
reason and unalterable and sure confidence, is truly happy and
blessed.</p>


<p>After faith the next prize which is offered as destined for
the man who acquires virtue by the gift of nature, as being
victorious without a struggle, is joy. For this man is


named as the Greeks would call him, Laughter, but as the
~ Chaldeans would entitle him, Isaac. And laughter is an
emblem in the body of that unseen joy which exists in the
mind. And joy is the most excellent and the most beautiful
of all the pleasant affections of the mind, by means of which
the whole soul is in every part entirely filled with cheerfulness,
rejoicing in the Father and Creator of all men and things,
hamely, in God, and rejoicing also in those things which are
done without wickedness, even though they may not be


<pb n="464"/>
<note type="head">464 PHILO JUDAUS,</note>


pleagant, as being done virtuously, and as contributing to the
duration of the universe.</p>


<p>For as in great and dangerous sicknesses a physician
sometimes actually takes away parts of the body, aiming at ensuring
the sound health of the rest, and as when storms arise the
pilot often throws overboard the cargo, out of a prudent regard
to the safety of the men sailing in the ship; and yet the
physician is not blamed for the mutilation of the body, nor the
pilot for the loss of the cargo, but on the contrary both
of them are praised as having seen and ensured what was
advantageous in preference to what was pleasant; so in the
same manner we must always look with proper admiration
at the nature of the entire universe, and we must be
pleased with all things which are done in the world without
intentional wickedness, inquiring not whether any thing has
been done which is not altogether pleasant, but whether the
world, like a city enjoying good laws, is guided and governed
in a manner calculated to ensure its safety. This man,
therefore, is happy in no less a degree than the one whom I
mentioned before, inasmuch as he is free from all depression or
melancholy, and as he enjoys a life exempt from sorrow and
exempt from fear, having no connection, not even in a dream,
with any painful or austere plans of life, because every part of
his soul is wholly occupied by joy.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>And next to the man who has acquired self-taught
virtue, and who has availed himself of the riches of nature, the
third person who is made perfect is the meditator on and
practiser of virtue, who receives as :his especial reward the sight of
God ; for as he has had experience of all the things which can
occur in human life, und as he has attained to a most intimate
understanding of them, and has shrunk from no labour and
from no danger which might enable him to track out and
overtake that most desirable thing. truth, he has found in con
nection with human life and with the human race a great deal
of darkness both by land and sea, and in the air, and in the
atmosphere. For the atmosphere and the whole of heaven has
presented to him the appearance of night, since every nature
which is discernible by the outward senses is indefinite; ang
what is indefinite is akin to and closely resembling darkness.</p>


<p>Accordingly, he who had during the preceding periods of his
life had the eyes of his soul closed, now began, though with


<pb n="465"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 465</note>


difficulty, to open them for the continual labours which were
before him, and to pierce through and dissipate the mist
which had overshadowed him. For an incorporeal ray of
light, purer than the atmosphere, suddenly beaming upon him,
displayed to him the fact of the world appreciable only by the
intellect being guided by a regular governor. But that
governor or guider, being surrounded on all sides by unalloyed
light, was difficult to be perceived and difficult to be
understood by conjecture, since the power of sight was obscured by
the brilliancy of those beams. But nevertheless the sight,
although a great violence of fire was poured upon it, held out
against it out of an immense desire of seeing what was before
it. “And the Father pitied its sincere desire and eagerness to
see, and gave it power, and did not grudge the acuteness of
the sight thus directed a perception of himself, as far at least
as a created and mortal nature could attain to such a thing,
not indeed such a perception as should show him what God is,
but merely such as should prove to him that he exists; for
even this, which is better than good, and more ancient than
the unit, and more simple than one, cannot possibly be
contemplated by any other being ; because, in fact, it is not
possible for God to be comprehended by any being but himself.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="7"/>But the fact that he does exist, though it is
comprehensible from the mere name of existence, is nevertheless not
understood by every one, or at all events not in the best way by
every one; but some men have expressly and wholly denied
that there is any deity at all; while others have doubted and
hesitated, as if they were unable to affirm with certainty
whether he has any existence or not. Others again, who have
more through habit than from any exertion of their reason,
received ideas about the existence of God from those who have
brought them up, have seemed to be pious by a sort of felicity
of conjecture, if they have stamped their piety with an
impression of superstition. But if any men, by a great depth of real
knowledge, have been able to represent to themselves the
Creator and Governor of this universe, they, according to the
common phrase, have advanced upwards from below; for
having entered into this world as into a city regulated by
admirable laws, and having beheld the earth consisting of
mountains, and of plains, and full of seed-crops, and of trees,
and of fruits, and also of all kinds of animals; and beholding



<pb n="466"/>
<note type="head">466 PHILO JUDAUS,</note>


also seas, and ports, and lakes, and rivers of all sorts, whether
proceeding from winter floods, or from everlasting springs,
diffused over the surface of it, and the admirable temperature of
the breezes and of the atmosphere, and the harmonious
changes and well-ordered revolutions of the seasons of the
year, and beyond all these things, the sun and moon, the
planets and fixed stars, and the whole heaven, and all the host
of heaven in its proper arrangement, and, in fact, the whole
real world revolving in admirable order and regularity:
admiring, and being struck with awe and amazement at these
things, they are come to form notions consistent with what they
behold, that all these beautiful things, excessive as they are,
and of such admirable arrangement and contrivance, were not
produced spontaneously but were the work of some maker, the
Creator of the whole world, and therefore that there must of
necessity be a superintending providence.</p>


<p>For it is a law of nature, that the Creator must take care of
what he has created. But these admirable men, so superior
to all others, have, as I said, raised themselves upwards from
below, ascending as if by some ladder reaching to heaven, so
as, through the contemplation of his works, to form a
conjectural conception of the Creator by a probable train of reasoning.
And if any persons have been able to comprehend him by
himself, without employing any other reasonings as assistants
towards their perception of him, they deserve to be recorded as
holy and genuine servants of his, and sincere worshippers of
God. In this company is the man who in the Chaldean
language is denominated Israel, but in the Greek “seeing
God;” not meaning by this expression seeing what kind
of being God is, for that is impossible, as I have said before,
but seeing that he really does exist ; not having learnt this fact
from any one else, nor from anything on earth, nor from
anything in heaven, nor from any one of the elements, nor from
anything compounded of them, whether mortal or immortal,
‘ut being instructed in the fact by God himself, who is willing
to reveal his own existence to his suppliant.</p>


<p>And how this impression was made, it is worth while to see
by the observation of some similitude. Take this sun, which is
perceptible by our outward senses, do we see it by any other
means than by the aid of the sun? And do we see the stars
by any other light than that of the stars? And, in short, is


<pb n="467"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS, 467</note>


not all light seen in consequence of light? And in the same
manner God, being his own light, is perceived by himself alone,
nothing and no other being co-operating with or assisting him,
or being at all able to contribute to the pure comprehension of
his existence ; therefore those persons are mere guessers who
are anxious to contemplate the uncreated God through the
medium of the things which he created, acting like those persons
who seek to ascertain the nature of the unit through the number
two, when they ought, on the other hand, to employ the
investigation of the unit itself to ascertain the nature of the number
two; for the unit is the first principle.</p>


<p>But these men have arrived at the real truth, who form
their ideas of God from God, of light from light.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>We have now described the greatest prize of all:
but in addition to these prizes, the meditator on virtue receives
another prize, not well-sounding indeed as to name, but very
excellent to be conceived of; and this prize is called "the
torpor of breadth,” speaking figuratively. Now by breadth
haughtiness and arrogance are typified; the soul, in those
conditions, pouring forth an immoderate effusion over objects
which are not desirable: and by torpor is typified the
contraction of conceit, an elated and puffed-up thing. But
nothing is so expedient, as that unrestrained and unlimited
impulses should ,be repressed and reduced to torpor, through
the spirit of the mind being extinguished: so that the
immoderate violence of the passions having become enfeebled, it
may give breadth to the better part of the soul. And we must
also consider how exceedingly suitable aprize has thus been
assigned to each of the three individuals ; for to him who has
been made perfect by education, faith is given as his reward ;
since it is necessary that he who learns must trust the man
who teaches him in the matters concerning which he is
instructing him; for it is difficult, or rather 1 might say
impossible, for a man to be instructed who distrusts his teacher.</p>


<p>Again: to him who arrives at virtue by his own good
natural disposition, joy is given ; for a good natural disposition
is a thing to be rejoiced at, and so are the gifts of nature;
since the mind derives enjoyment from all displays of
acuteness and felicitous inventions, by which it finds the object
which it is seeking without trouble; as if there was some
prompter within enriching it with inventions ; for the prompt





<pb n="468"/>
<note type="head">468 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


discovery of matters previously, not certainly understood, is a.
subject of joy.</p>


<p>Again: to him who has acquired wisdom by meditation and
practice, sight is given. For after the practical life of youth
comes the contemplative life of old age, which is the most
excellent and the most sacred, which God has sent down from
above to take its place in the stern like a pilot, and has given
the helm into his hand as being able to guide the course of all
earthly things ; for without contemplation based on knowledge,
there is nothing whatever that is good done.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>Having thus mentioned one man of each class, since I
am anxious not to be prolix, I will proceed to what comes next
in the order of discussion. Now, this man was proclaimed as
conqueror, and crowned as such in the sacred contests, And
when I speak of sacred contests, I do not mean those which are
accounted such by other nations, for they are in reality unholy,
affixing, as they do, rewards and honours to acts of violence,
and insolence, and injustice, instead of the very extremity of
punishment, which of right belongs to them: but I mean
rather such as the soul is by nature formed to go through,
which, by means of prudence, drives away folly and wicked
cunning, and by temperance drives away prodigality and
stinginess, and by courage drives away both rashness and cowardice,
and the other vices which are in direct opposition to the
respective virtues, and which are of no nse either to themselves
or to any one else; therefore all the virtues are represented as
virgins. ‘


And the most excellent of all, having taken the post of
leader as if in a chorus, is piety and righteousness, which Moses,
the interpreter of the will of God, possessed in a most
eminent degree. On which account, besides an innumerable host
of other circumstances which are recorded of him in the
accounts which have come down to us of his life, he has
received also four most especial prizes, in being invested with
sovereign power, with the office of lawgiver, with the power of
prophecy, and with the office of high priest- For he was a
king, not indeed acording to the usual fashion with soldiers
und arms, and forces of fleets, and infantry, and cavalry, but as
having been appointed by God, with the free consent of the
people who were to be governed by him, and who wrought in
his subjects a willingness to make such a voluntary choice.


<pb n="469"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 469</note>


For he is the only king of whom we have any mention as
being neither a speaker nor one frequently heard, nor
possessed of wealth or riches, since he was anxious rather about
the wealth which sees than about that which is blind, and, if
one is to speak the truth without any concealment, one who
looked upon the inheritance of God as his peculiar property.
And this same man was likewise a lawgiver; for a king must
of necessity both command and forbid, and law is nothing
else but a discourse which enjoins what is right and forbids
what is not right; but since it is uncertain what is expedient
im each separate case (for we often out of ignorance command
what is not right to be done, and forbid what is right), it was
very natural for him also to receive the gift of prophecy, in
order to ensure him against stumbling; for a prophet is an
interpreter, God from within prompting him what he ought to
say ; and with God nothing is blameable.</p>


<p>In the fourth place he received the high priesthood, by means
of which he, prophesying in accordance with knowledge,
worships the living God, and by which also he will bring before
him in a propitiating manner, the thanksgivings of his
subjects when they do well, and their prayers and supplications
if at any time they are unfortunate ; now since all these things
belong to one class, they ought to he held together and united
by mutual bonds, and to be perceived in the same man,
since he who is deficient in any one of the four is imperfect
in his authority, as he is consequently invested with but a
crippled authority over the common interests.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="10"/>We have now thus spoken at sufficient length
concerning the rewards proposed for each individual man: but rewards
are also offered to whole houses, and to very numerous families.</p>


<p>When the nation was originally divided into twelve tribes,
there were at once appointed patriarchs equal in number to
the tribes, being not merely of one house or family, but
connected by a still more genuine relationship: for they were all
brothers having one and the same father; and the father and
grandfather of these men were, with their father, the original
founders of the whole nation.</p>


<p>Therefore the first man who forsook pride and came over to
truth, and who despised the jugglery of the Chaldaic branches
of learning, because of that more perfect vision which had
been granted to him, after having seen which he was so


<pb n="470"/>
<note type="head">470 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


captivated that he followed the vision, just as they say that wire
is attracted by the magnet, becoming instead of a sophist
which he had been before a wise man in consequence of
instruction—he had many children: but they were not all
virtuous, though there was one who was utterly blameless,
to whom he bound the cables of his whole race, and thus
brought them to a safe anchorage.</p>


<p>Again his son who had acquired spontaneous and self-taught
wisdom had two sons, one a wild and untameable man, full
of anger and desire, and one in short who raised up the
irrational part of his soul as a fortification against the rational
part; but the other a mild and gentle follower and worker of
virtue, placed in the more excellent class of equality and
simplicity, the very champion of reason and declared enemy of
folly: he is the third of the founders of his race, a man with
many sons, and the only one truly happy in his children,
being free from all injury in every part of his family, and like
a fortunate husbandman seeing all his seed in a state of safety,
and well cultivated, and bearing fruit.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="11"/>And every one of these three individuals has in the
account which we have received of him a figurative meaning
concealed below it, which we must now consider. Now the
moment that any one is taught anything, it happens to him to
forsake ignorance and to come over to knowledge; and
ignorance is a thing of a multiform character: on this account the
first of the three is said to have had many children, but not
to have thought any one of them worthy for him to call his
son, except one: for in a manner he who learns discards the
offspring of ignorance, and repudiates them as inimical and
hostile to him.</p>


<p>Now by nature all we who are men, before the reason that
is in us is brought to perfection, lie on the borders between
virtue and vice, without ever inclining as yet to either side:
but when the mind, beginning to put forth its wings, sees an
appearance of the good with its whole soul, impressing it in all
its parts, it immediately bursts through all restraint, and bein
borne on wings rushes towards it, leaving behind the kindred
evil which was born with it, which it flees from, proceeding in
the other direction without ever turning back: this is what he
intends to imply by an enigmatical expression when he says
that the man who was endowed by nature with a good


<pb n="471"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 471</note>


disposition had two sons, twins: tor every man has at the beginning
simultaneously with his birth, a soul which is pregnant with
twins, namely, good and evil, bearing the impression of both
of them: but when it receives the blessed and happy part,
then by the force of one single attraction it inclines to the
good, never once leaning towards the other side, and never
even wavering so as to appear to be balancing between the two.</p>


<p>But that soul which besides having a good natural disposition
has also received a good education, and has been trained by
the third mentioned person in the meditations of virtue, so
that none of them float at random on the surface, but that
they are all firmly glued and fixed in their places, as if
united by some compact sinews, acquires health and acquires
power, which are followed by a good complexion, owing to
modesty, and also good health and beauty.</p>


<p>And thus the soul becoming a perfect company of virtues,
by means of these three most excellent patronesses, nature,
instruction, and meditation, and not having left one single
spot in itself empty, so as to allow of the entrance of anything
else, engenders perfect number, namely, two lots of sons, of
six in each, being a representation and imitation of the circle
of the zodiac, in order to the improvement of everything in
them : this is the family exempt from all injury, being
continually devoted to the study of the holy scriptures, both in their
literal sense and also in the allegories figuratively contained in
them: which received as a prize, as I have said before, the
supreme authority over each of the tribes of the nation. Of
this house therefore, as it increased and became very populous
in process of time, well regulated cities were founded, being
schools of wisdom, and justice, and holiness, in which also the
means of acquiring all other virtue was investigated in a grave
manner suited to the importance of the subject.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="12"/>Therefore those rewards which were thus long since
assigned to the good, both publicly and privately, have now
been described though somewhat in outline, but sufiiciently
to enable anyone to comprehend with tolerable ease what has
been omitted. We must now proceed in regular order to
consider in turn the punishments appointed for the wicked,
speaking of them in a somewhat general way since the time
does not allow of my enumerating all the particular instances


Now there was at the very beginning of the world when


<pb n="472"/>
<note type="head">472 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


the race of men had not as yet multiplied, a fratricide: this is
the first man who ever was under a curse; the first man who
imprinted on the pure earth the unprecedented pollution of
human blood; the first man who checked the fertility of the
earth which was previously blooming, and producing all kinds
of animals, and plants, and flourishing with every kind of
productiveness ; the first man who introduced destruction as a
rival against creation, death against life, sorrow against joy,
and evil against good. What then could possibly have been
inflicted upon him, which would have been an adequate
punishment for him, who thus in one single action left no
description of violence and impiety unperformed ? Perhaps some one
will say he should have been put to death at once; this is a
human mode of reasoning, fit for one who does not consider
the great tribunal of all; for men look upon death as the
extreme limit of all punishments, but in the view of the divine
tribunal it is scarcely the beginning of them.</p>


<p>Since then the action of this man was a novel one, it was
necessary that a novel punishment should be devised for him;
and what was it? That he should live continually dying, and
that he should in a manner endure an undying and never
ending death; for there are two kinds of death; the one that
of being dead, which is either good or else a matter of
indifference ; the other that of dying, which is in every respect
an evil; and the more protracted the dying the more
intolerable the evil. Consider now then how it is that death can be
said to be never ending in this man’s case; since there are
four different affections to which the soul is liable, two of them
being conversant with good either present or future, namely,
pleasure and desire; and two with evil either present or
expected, namely, sorrow and fear; it cuts up the pair of those
which are conversant with good by the roots, in order that the
man may never receive pleasure from any accident of fortune,
nor ever feel a desire even for anything pleasant; and it
leaves him only those affections conversant about evil, sorrow
without any mixture of cheerfulness, and unmingled fear,
for the scripture says<ref n="472.1"/> that God laid a curse upon the fratricide,
so that he should be continually groaning and trembling.</p>


<p>Moreover he put a mark upon him, that he might never be


<note n="472.1"> Genesis iv. 14.
</note>


<pb n="473"/>





pitied by any one, so that he might not die once, but might, as
I have said before, pass all his time in dying, amid griefs, and
pains, and incessant calamities ; and what is most grievous of
all, might have a feeling of his own miseries, and be afflicted
both with the evils which were before him, and also from a
foresight of the number of misfortunes which were constantly
impending over him, which nevertheless he was unable to
guard against, since hope was wholly taken from him, which
God has implanted in the race of mankind, in order that thus,
having an innate comfort in themselves, they might feel their
sorrows relieved, provided they had not committed any
inexpiable crimes.</p>


<p>Therefore, as a man who is being carried away by a torrent
shudders at the nearest waves by which he is being hurried
away, and still more at those coming upon him from above,
since the one is continually and incessantly propelling him
forward with violence, but the other being raised above him
threatens to overwhelm him utterly, so in the same manner
those evils which are present are grievous, but those which
proceed from fear of the future are more grievous still; for
fear continually supplies sorrowful feelings as from an
everlasting spring.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="13"/>These punishments, then, are those which were
decided on to be inflicted on the first slayer of his brother.
But others were also appointed for households which had
entered into any conspiracy to unite in crime.</p>


<p>And there were some men appointed to be keepers of the
temple and ministers in the sacred offices, classed as a kind of
door-keepers. These men, being wholly filled with
unreasonable pride, rose up in rebellion against the priests, desiring to
appropriate their honours and privileges to themselves.</p>


<p>And, having elected as chief of their conspiracy the eldest of
their body, who also, with a few of those who joined in this
audacious folly, was the leader of the whole enterprise, they
left the outer courts and precincts of the tabernacle and entered
into the most holy places, expelling those who, by the
oracularcommands of God, had been thought worthy of the priesthood.</p>


<p>Therefore, as was natural, a great confusion spread among
the whole multitude, in consequence of things being disturbed
which never ought to have been moved, and of the laws being
openly violated and all the ordinances for the regular service of


<pb n="474"/>
<note type="head">474 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


the temple being thrown into confusion by wicked disobedience,
at which the governor and president of the nation was
indignant. And, at first, displaying a stern disposition, though
without any anger (for he was the meekest of men and by
nature incapable of anger), he endeavoured by arguments to
persuade them to alter their conduct, and not to transgress the
bounds laid down for them, nor to seek to overturn the
ordinances established with respect to holy and consecrated things
on which the hopes of the whole nation depended. But when
he could not succeed in the least, but found that the people
were deaf to all his entreaties, since they looked upon him as
wholly under the influence of domestic affection and thought
that it was on that account that he had made his brother high
priest, and had given the inferior priesthood to his nephews, he
still was not so much indignant at that, though it was a
shocking thing, as at this other all terrible idea that they were
imputing to him a contempt for the sacred oracles, in accordance
with which the election of priests had taken place.<ref n="474.1"/> ...
<ref n="474.2"/></p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="14"/>And there is a distinct evidence in confirmation of
what I have now said recorded in the sacred scriptures;
because, in the first place, the sacred historian records the
prayers which he commonly calls blessings. ‘“If,"<ref n="474.3"/> says he,
“you keep the commandments of God and are obedient to his
injunctions, and receive what is said to you, not merely so far
as to listen to them, but also to fulfil them by the actions of
your lives, you shall have as a first reward victory over your
enemies; for the commandments are not burdensome or too
weighty for the ability of you who are to live by them to obey,
nor is the good which is promised to you removed to any
distance, either beyond the sea, or at the furthest extremities of
the country, so as to require a long and painful journey to
avail yourselves of it.” Nor did the lawgiver at once set out
on his departure from earth to heaven, so that no one else being
raised on high and borne aloft on wings could attain to the
obedience which he enjoined ; but the obedience remained near
and very close to men, being fixed separately in three parts of
us, in the mouth, and heart, and hands; that is to say, in the
speech, and designs, and actions of every one.


<note n="474.1"> Numbers xvi. 1.</note>

<note n="474.2"> There appears to be a considerable hiatus in the text here.</note>

<note n="474.3"> Deuteronomy xxx. 10.
</note>


<pb n="475"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS, 475</note>


For if such as the designs are, such also are the speeches
and such as the words spoken, such also are the actions; and
if these things are bound up with each other, reciprocally
preceding and following one another through the indissoluble
bonds of harmony; then happiness prevails, and this is the
truest wisdom and prudence. For wisdom has reference to the
service of God, and prudence to the regulation of human life.</p>


<p>Therefore, as long as the commandments conveyed in the
laws are only spoken, they meet with but little or no
acceptance; but when words in proper consistency and conformity
with them are added to them in all the pursuits of life, then
those commandments, being brought forth as it were from deep
darkness to light, will shine forth in all respectability and
glory; for who, even of those who are naturally envious, would
hesitate to say that this is the only wise and truly learned race
of men, which has the sense not to leave the divine commands
destitute of and unattended by corresponding actions, but
which takes care to fulfil the words with praiseworthy actions?
This class of men lives not far from God, keeping always
before its eyes the beautiful things of heaven, and being guided
in all its ways by heavenly love; so that if any one were to
inquire of what character a great nation is, one might very
properly answer—it is a nation whose most sacred prayers God
hears, and to whose invocations, proceeding as they do from a
pure conscience, he gladly draws near.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="15"/>But since there are also two classes of enemies—the
one being men, who are so deliberately, out of covetousness ;
the other being beasts, who are not so out of any deliberate
purpose, or through study, but as being endowed with a nature
utterly alien to ours—we must proceed to speak of them both
in turn, and we will take, in the first place, the beasts which
are our natural enemies ; for these are hostile not to one city,
or to one nation, but to the whole race of mankind, and that too
not for any definite or limited period of time, but for an
indefinite and illimitable eternity.</p>


<p>Of these some fear man as their master, and crouch beneath
him with an angry fear; others, again, being bold and fearless,
watch their opportunity and are the first to begin the warfare
and attack him; if they are weaker than he, by an ambush ;
and if they are stronger, openly. ~ For this war is one which
admits of no truce and of no termination, but is like that existing


<pb n="476"/>
<note type="head">476 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


between the wolves and the sheep, and between all wild beasts,
whether living in the water or on the land, and men; and no
mortal can terminate it, but only the one uncreated God, when
he selects some persons as worthy to be the saviours of their race ;
men who are peaceful, indeed, in disposition, fond of unanimity
and fellowship with others, with whom envy has either
absolutely never had any connection at all, or else it has speedily
departed from them ; and these men have determined to throw
all their own private good things into the common stock for the
use and enjoyment of all.</p>


<p>For if this good should ever at any future time shine upon
the world, so that we may be able to see the time in which the
savage animals shall become manageable, long before that the
wild passions in the soul will be tamed, and it is not possible
to imagine a greater blessing than that; for is it not a piece of
absolute folly to imagine that we can ever avoid injuries from
wild beasts which are outside, while we are continually training
up the passions within ourselves to a terrible degree of
savageness? On which account we must not despair that when the
passions of our mind are tamed and subdued, then the wild
beasts also will be broken in. Then it seems to me that bears,
and lions, and leopards, and those beasts which are found only
in India, elephants and tigers, and all other animals whose
courage and strength are invincible, will change from their
solitary and unsociable habits, and adopt a more gregarious
life, and, by a gradual imitation of those animals which live in
troops, will become softened and accustomed to the sight of
men, being no longer in a constant state of excitement and
fury against him, but rather feeling awe of him ag their ruler
and natural master, and will behave with proper respect to
him ; and some of them, with an exceeding greatness of
tameness and affection for their master, like Maltese dogs, will even
fawn upon them and wag their tails with a cheerful motion.
Then the species of scorpions, and serpents, and other reptiles
will keep their venom inoperative; and the Egyptian river
will produce those animals, which are at present carnivorous
and which feed on man, called crocodiles and hippopotami,
in a tame and gentle condition ; and the sea too will produce
innumerable kinds of animals, among all of which the virtuous
man will be sacred and unhurt, since God honours virtue and has
given it immunity from all designs against it as a proper reward.


<pb n="477"/>

<milestone unit="chapter" n="16"/>Thus, then, the most ancient war, both in point of
time and in nature, will be put an end to, when all the wild
beasts will be tamed and will have altered their dispositions so
as to become manageable. But the more modern war, which
has arisen out of the deliberate purposes of men from their
covetousness, will be likewise easily put an end to, as it appears
to me, since men will be ashamed to be seen to be more savage
than even the brute beasts, after they have escaped all injury
and damage from them; for it will naturally appear a most
shameful thing for venomous, carnivorous, man-devouring,
unsociable, ferocious animals to have become friendly to man,
changing to a peaceful disposition, and for man, who is by
nature a gentle animal, with a natural inclination to sociality
and unanimity, to renounce peace and seek the destruction of
his fellows.</p>


<p>Therefore, says the lawgiver, peace shall never come at all
into the country of the pious, but shall fall to pieces of itself,
and shall be dashed to pieces against itself, when the enemies
perceive against what fierce and invincible enemies the contest
is, and employ against them the irresistible alliance of justice ;
for virtue is a great, and dignified, and very venerable thing,
aud is by itself, when in tranquillity, able to alleviate the
attacks of great evils. And even if some men are in their
frenzy driven to quarrel, indulging their spontaneous and
implacable desire for war, until indeed they are actually engaged,
they will, being full of confidence, behave with great insolence,
but after they have once come to a regular contest they will
then find that they have made an empty boast, and that they
are unable to gain the victory ; for as they will be repelled by
force equal to their own,<ref n="477.1"/> or even more powerful still, they
will flee in great confusion, a hundred fleeing before five, and
a host of ten thousand before a hundred men, and those who
had come by one road fleeing by a great number.</p>


<p>Some will even flee when no one pursues at all except fear,
turning their backs towards the enemy, so as to afford a full
mark for shooting, so that it will be very easy for the whole
army to fall, being slain to a man; for a man will come
forth,<ref n="477.2"/> says the word of God, leading a host and warring
furiously, who will subdue great and populous nations, God
sending that assistance which is suitable for pious men; and


<note n="477.1"> Leviticus xxvi. 8.</note>
<note n="477.2"> Numbers xxiv. 7.
</note>


<pb n="478"/>
<note type="head">478 PHILO JUDEUS. -</note>


this assistance is an intrepid bardihood of soul, and an irre
sistible strength of body, either of which things is formidable
to the enemy, and if both qualities are united they are
completely invincible. Moreover he says, “That some of the
enemy will be unworthy of being defeated and of perishing by
the hands of men, to which he will oppose swarms of wasps,<ref n="478.1"/>
who shall fight for the pious, so as to overwhelm their enemies
with shameful destruction; and he predicts, that he will not
only always firmly retain the bloodless victory thus gained, but
that he will also have an irresistible power of dominion, so as
to be able to benefit the people subject to him, who may
become so, whether out of good will, or out of fear, or out of
shame; for he will have in him three things of the greatest
importance, all contributing greatly to rendering his authority
indestructible, namely, dignity, and terror, and beneficence,
by means of which qualities the ends above-mentioned will
be gained; for dignity causes respect, and terror causes fear,
and beneficence causes good will; which, when they are mixed
together, and adapted, and united in the soul, render subjects
obedient to their rulers.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="17"/>These, then, are the first things which he says will
happen to those who obey God, and who at all times and in
all places observe his commandments, and who adapt them to
every part of their lives, so that no one going astray under
the influence of disease may wander from them. The second
thing is wealth, which must of necessity follow peace and
authority ; but the simple wealth of nature is food and shelter,
and food is bread and water from the spring, which are both
diffused over every part of the habitable world ; but of shelter
there are two kinds, first of all clothes, and secondly a house,
on account of the injuries which result from exposure to
cold and heat; each of which protections, if any one chooses
to discard superfluous and excessive extravagance, is very
easily provided.</p>


<p>But those who admire what has been described above,
having rather a desire for the gifts of nature than for those of
vain opinion, devoting themselves to frugality, and simplicity,
and temperance, will have a great abundance and means for
all kinds of delicate living without any labour or study; for
wealth will come to those who know how to use it in a


<note n="478.1"> Exodus xxiii. 28.
</note>


<pb n="479"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 479</note>


befitting manner, as to those who are at the same time the most
proper, and, in fact, the most nearly related to it and
thoroughly worthy of it, gladly fleeing from all association
with intemperate and insolent men, that it may not pass by
those persons whose existence is a common benefit to
mankind, and supply those who live to the injury of their
neighbours; for there is a passage in the word of God,<ref n="479.1"/> that, “on
those who observe the sacred commands of God, the heaven
will shower down seasonable raius, and the earth will bring
forth for them abundance of all kinds of fruits, the champaign
country producing crops from seed, and the mountainous
country fruit from trees;” and that no period will ever be
left entirely destitute of benefits for them, but that they shall,
without interruption, incessantly receive the favours of God,
the time of harvest succeeding the season of gathering the
grapes, and the season of gathering the grapes following the
seed time, so that men, without any cessation or any
interruption, are continually carrying home one crop and hoping for
another, while one as it were lies in wait for the next; so that
the beginnings of those which come on after are connected
with the ends of those which have preceded them, and thus
make a kind of circle and revolving body, which is endowed
with every imaginable good.</p>


<p>For the great multitude of things which are thus produced
will be sufficient both for present use and enjoyment, and also
for an unlimited abundance of supply in the time to come, the
grain constantly coming up and flourishing, as the successors
of the old, and filling up the void, which would otherwise be
cursed by their decay and disappearance. There are also
cases in which, by reason of the ineffable plenty, no one will
think at all of those stores which have been collected long ago,
but leaves them without any care or any attempt to store
them, permitting every one who pleases to use them without
restraint and with perfect impunity.</p>


<p>For as to those men for whom that true wisdom is stored
up, which has been derived from constant meditation and
practice in wisdom and holiness, on them the wrath which
consists of money upon earth is abundantly poured, since the
treasure-houses, by the providence and care of God, are kept
continually full; because the impulses of the mind, and the


<note n="479.1"> Leviticus xxvi. 3.

<note type="head">480 PHILO JUDUS.</note>


endeavours of the hands, are not hindered in any way, so as to
prevent the successful attainment of these objects, which are
constantly pursued with anxiety. But those persons who, by
reason of their impiety or unrighteousness, have not a heavenly
inheritance, have also no abundant possession or share of the
good things upon the earth; and even if any such thing should
come to them, it quickly departs again, as if it had originally
happened to them, not for the advantage of the immediate
recipients, but in order that a more vehement sorrow may
overwhelm them, such as must, of necessity, follow the being
deprived of au important blessing.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="18"/>And at that time, says the law, you, by reason of
the abundant fertility, shall do what you now suffer, For now,
indeed, you pay no respect either to the laws or to the customs
of your country and of your forefathers, but neglecting them
altogether equally, you fail to obtain what is necessary, and
keep counting the houses of the usurers and money-changers,
being continually wishing to borrow at heavy interest; and
then, as I said a minute ago, you shall do the contrary. For,
by reason of your own unlimited abundance, you yourself shall
lend to others, and that not lending little things, nor lending
to few persons, but you shall lend large sums, and to many
people, indeed to whole nations, all your affairs prospering and
turning out well, both in the country and in the city; all
things im the city, as respects offices of authority. and honour,
and glory, and reputation, by means of wise conjectures, and
prudent counsels, and conduct tending both in word and deed
to the general advantage; and all the things in the country in
consequence of the abundant production of all necessary things,
such as corn, and wine, and oil, and all other productions
which conduce to a comfortable and easy life, and these are
the innumerable kinds of fruit from different trees, and the
prolific increase of herds of oxen, and flocks of goats, and
other kinds of cattle.</p>


<p>But some one may say, What is the use of all these things
to one who is not likely to leave heirs and successors
behind him? The law, setting as it were the seal to its acts
of beneficence, replies: No one shall be without offspring, nor
shall there be a barren woman; but all the genuine and
sincere servants of God shall fulfil the law of nature as respects
the propagation of their species; for the men shall become


<pb n="481"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS, 481</note>


fathers, and the fathers shall be happy in their offspring, and
the women shall be happy mothers of children, so that every
house shall be a full company of a numerous family, no part and
no name being omitted of all those which are appropriated to
relations, whether referring to relations upwards, such as
uncles and grandfathers, or to descending relations on the
other hand of a similar kindred, such as brothers, nephews,
grandsons by the sons’ side, grandsons by the daughters’ side,
cousins, cousins’ children, and every kind of blood relations,
But no man shall die prematurely or without having fulfilled
the legitimate end of his being among those men who observe
the laws, nor shall such fail to reach the age which God has
allotted to the race of man. But the human being
proceeding upwards from childhood, as it were by the different
stages of a ladder, and at the appointed periods of time
fulfilling the regularly determined boundaries of each age, will
eventually arrive at the last of all, that which is near to death,
or rather to immortality ; being really and truly happy in his
old age, leaving behind him a house happy in numerous and
virtuous children in his own place.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="19"/>This is what the lawgiver in one passage says, while
decléring the will of God, that, "thou shalt complete the
number of thy days,”<ref n="481.1"/> prophesying thus with great beauty and
using great propriety and naturalness of language. For the
man who is destitute of all learning, and who disregards the
law, does not speak either in reason nor in number, as the old
proverb says; but he who has a fair share of instruction and who
adheres to the holy Jaws, receives as his first reward, since he
is proved to be a respectable and reputable man, a share in
number and arrangement. And very admirable is this fulness
and completeness, not of months or years, but of days, so that
no day whatever in the life of a virtuous man ever leaves an
empty and open door for the entrance of sins, but is filled in
all its parts and all its intervals with absolute virtue and
excellence.</p>


<p>For virtue and goodness are judged of not by quantity but
by quality, for which reason I look upon it that even one day
spent with perfect correctness is of equal value with the entire
good life of a wise man. This is what is enigmatically implied
in other expressions, where the holy writer says that such 9


<note n="481.1"> Psalm cxx, 8.
</note>


<pb n="482"/>
<note type="head">482 ‘ PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


man “shall deserve blessings both at his coming in and going
out}” because the virtuous man is praiseworthy in all his
positions and in all his actions, both indoors and out of doors,
whether engaged in affairs of state or in the regulation of his
household, regulating all his affairs inside his house with
economy, and all the business out of doors with a due regard to
principles of state government in the way in which it is most
expedient for them to be regulated.</p>


<p>If, then, any one proves himself a man of such a character
in the city he will appear superior to the whole city, and if a
city show itself of such a character it will be the chief of all
the country around ; and if a nation do so it will be the lord of
all the other nations, as the head is to the body occupying the
pre-eminence of situation, not more for the sake of glory than
for that of advancing the interests of those that see. For
continual appearances of good models stamp impressions closely
resembling themselves on all souls which are not utterly
obdurate and intractable; and I say this with reference to
those who wish to imitate models of excellent and admirable
beauty, that they may not despair of a change for the better,
nor of an alteration and improvement from that dispersion, as
it were, of the soul which vice engenders, so that they may be
able to effect a return to virtue and wisdom.</p>


<p>For when God is favourable every thing is made easy. And
he is favourable to those who display modesty and due
reverence, and who seek to pass over from intemperance to
tempeyance, and who reproach themselves for all the blameable
actions of their life, and for all the base images which they
have stamped upon their polluted souls, and who aim at a
tranquil state of the passions, and who keep constantly in
view, as the proper object of their pursuit, a calmness and
serenity of life. ;


As therefore God, by one single word of command, could
easily collect together men living on the very confines of the
earth, bringing them from the extremities of the world to any
place which he may choose, so also the merciful Saviour can
bring back the soul after its long wandering, after it has been
straying about in every direction, and been ill-treated by
pleasure and desire, most imperious mistresses, and guide it easily
from a trackless waste into a regular road when it has once
determined to flee from evil without ever looking back, a


<pb n="483"/>
<note type="head">ON REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS. 483</note>


flight not liable to reproach, but the cause of its preservation,
which no one will do wrong to pronounce more desirable than
any return.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="20"/>These, then, of which we have already spoken, are


what are called external goods, victory over one’s enemies,
superiority in war, confirmation of peace, and abundance of
those good things which belong to peace, riches, and honours,
and authorities, and the praises which always follow those who
are successful, as they are extolled by every mouth both of
friends and enemies, by the one through fear, and by the
others out of good will.</p>


  <p>We must now proceed to speak of what is more nearly
connected with us than these things, namely, about those things
which affect the body. The lawgiver says, then, that a perfect
freedom from disease in every respect, both privately and
generally, shall be allotted to those persons who labour in the
service of virtue and who make the sacred laws the guides of
all their speeches and actions in life; and if there should any
infirmity affect them it will not be for the sake of injuring
them, but with a view to remind a mortal that he is mortal, so
as to eradicate overbearing pride and improve his disposition.
And sound health will follow, and a good condition of the out
ward senses, and a perfectness and completeness in all the
parts, conducive to the unimpeded performance of those duties
for which each man has been born. For God has thought fit
to give as a reward to the virtuous a house thoroughly well
built and well put together from the foundations to the roof;
and the most natural house for the soul is the body, inasmuch
as it does many things necessary and useful for life, and
especially on account of the mind which has been purified by
perfect purifications; and which, having been initiated in the
divine mysteries, and having learnt to dwell only among the
motions and periodical revolutions of the heavenly bodies, God
has honoured with tranquillity, wishing it to be completely
undisturbed and exempt from any contact of those passions
which the necessities of the body engender, adding, out of
covetousness, a desire for sovereignty over the passions.</p>


<p>For either the heaven has caused a chill to something, or
has scorched something, or has made something dry, or else,
on the contrary, has melted and liquefied it; from all which
causes the mind is unable to keep its path through life quite


II 2


<pb n="484"/>
<note type="head">484 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


straight and independent. But if it has its abode in a healthy
body, then it will with great care and tranquillity dwell among
and devote all its leisure to the meditations of wisdom, having
obtained a happy and fortunate existence. This is the mind
which has drunk strong draughts of the beneficent power of
God, and has feasted on his sacred words and doctrines. This
is the mind in which the prophet says that God walks as in
his palace ; for the mind of the wise man is in truth the palace
and the house of God.</p>


<p>And he who is the God of all things is peculiarly called the
God of this mind; and again this mind is by a peculiar form
called his people, not the people of any particular rulers, but
of the one only and true ruler, the Holy One of holies.</p>


<p>This is the mind which a little while ago was enslaved to
many pleasures and many desires, and to innumerable necessities
arising from weaknesses and desires ; but its evils God crushed
in slavery, having elected to bring it to freedom. This is the
mind which has received a favour not to be suppressed in
silence, but rather to be proclaimed abroad and announced in
every quarter, on account of the authority and power of its
champion and defender, by which it was not thrust down to the
tail, but was raised upwards to the head.</p>


<p>But all these statements are uttered in a metaphorical form,
and contain an allegorical meaning. For as in an animal the
head is the first and best part, and the tail the last and worst
part, or rather no part at all, inasmuch as it does not complete
the number of the limbs, being only a broom to sweep away
what flies against it; so in the same manner what is said here
is that the virtuous man shall be the head of the human race
whether he be a single man or a whole people. And that all
others, being as it were parts of the body, are only vivified by
the powers existing in the head and superior portions of the
body.</p>


<p>These are the prayers on behalf of good men who fulfil the
laws by their actions which it is said will be accomplished by
the grace of the bounteous and beneficent God, who honours
and rewards all that is good for the sake of its similarity to
himself.</p>


<p>We must now consider the curses appointed against those
who transgress the commandments and the laws.


<pb n="485"/>
<note type="head">ON CURSES, 485</note>


A TREATISE
ON CURSES,


<milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>Tue lawgiver of our nation denounces the first curse as
the lightest of evils, namely, poverty and indigence, and a
want of all necessary things, and a participation in every kind
of destitution ; for, says he, “The enemy shall lay waste the
corn-fields before they are ripe, and when the corn is ripened
they shall suddenly come and reap it.”<ref n="485.1"/> Thus causing a
twofold calamity, famine to their friends and abundance to their
enemies ; for the prosperity of one’s enemies is more, or, at all
events, not less painful than one’s own misfortunes.</p>


<p>And even if one’s enemies are quiet, still those evils which
proceed from nature and which are even more grievous, are
not quiet; for you, indeed, sow the deep and fertile soil of the
plain, but suddenly a cloud of locusts shall fly down and reap
your crop, and what is left behind for you to carry home to
your barns will bear but a very small proportion to what is
sown.</p>


<p>And, again, you shall plant a vineyard with unsparing
expense, and incessant industry, and labour, such as it is
natural for husbandmen to undergo; but when the vines are
come to perfection, and are flourishing and weighed down with
their own productiveness, the worms shall come and gather the
grapes. And when you see your oliveyards flourishing, and an
unbounded exuberance of fruit on the trees, you will very
naturally be delighted from the hope of a successful harvest
which you will be led to entertain, but when you begin to carry
home the fruit, then you will be filled rather with sorrow than
with joy; for the oil and all the fatness of the fruit will all
flow away and disappear imperceptibly, and what is outside
will be only a vain burden, empty, left only to deceive the
empty soul. And, in short, all the seed crops and all the
trees will be destroyed, fruit and all, by blight of one kind or
another.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>And there are other misfortunes also lying in wait for
the men besides those which have been mentioned, all equally
contributing to produce want and scarcity ; for those things, by


<note n="485.1"> Deuteronomy xxviii. 33.
</note>


<pb n="486"/>
<note type="head">486 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


xweans of which nature used to provide men with good things,
uamely, the earth and the heaven, will both be rendered
barren, the one being full of abortions and unable to bring any
fruit to perfection, and the other changing its nature so as te
produce an unproductive state of the seasons of the year, sc
that neither winter, nor summer, nor spring, nor autumn return
in their appointed order, but are all violently wrenched from
it, and thrown into a confusion destitute of all distinctive
quality and completely disturbed, by the command of the
supreme authority. For then there will be no rain, no showers,
no gentle springs, no soft drops of moisture, no dew, nor
anything else which can contribute to the growth of plants; but,
on the contrary, all things which are calculated to dry them up
when beginning to grow, all things destructive of the fruit when
beginning to ripen, and adapted to prevent it from ever coming
to perfection. .
For, says God, “I will make the heaven of brass for you,
and the earth iron.”<ref n="486.1"/> Implying by this enigmatical expression
that neither of them shall accomplish the tasks which naturally
belong to them and for which they were created; for how could
iron ever bear ears of corn, or how could brass produce rain, of
which all animals stand in need, and especially that animal so
liable to misfortune and in need of so many things, man ?
And God intimates here not only barrenness and the
destruetion of the seasons of the year, but also the beginnings of wars,
and of all the intolerable and ineffable evils which arise in
wars; for brass and iron are the materials for warlike arms.
And the earth, indeed, shall produce dust, and masses of dirt
shall be brought down from above, from heaven, weighing down
the fruit and destroying it by choking, in order that nothing
may be omitted which can tend to complete destruction; for
numerous families will be made desolate, and cities will suddenly
become empty of their inhabitants, remaining as monuments of
their former prosperity and records of subsequent disaster, for
the warning of those who are capable of receiving correction.
<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>And such a complete scarcity of all necessary things will
seize the people that, being wholly destitute of and indifferent
to them, they will turn even to devouring one another, eating
not only the gentiles and those who are no relations to them,
vut even their nearest and dearest kinsfolk; for the father will
<note n="486.1"> Deuteronomy xxviii. 28.
</note>


<pb n="487"/>
<note type="head">ON CURSES. 487</note>


take of the flesh of his son, and the mother will eat of the
lifeblood of her daughter, brothers will eat their brothers, and
children will devour their parents; and, in fact, the weaker
will be continually the prey of the more powerful; and that
wicked and accursed food, that of Thyestes, will seem to them
like a joke when compared with the excessive and intolerable
evils which their necessities bring upon them; for, as in the
case of other persons, while they are in prosperity they desire
length of life to be able to enjoy all good things, so also even
those men overwhelmed with misery will have a vehement
desire for life established in them, though it can only lead them
to a participation in immoderate and interminable evils, all of
which are likewise irremediable.</p>


<p>For it would have been better for such men to have escaped
misery by cutting off their griefs through death, which persons
who are not utterly out of their senses are accustomed to do,
But these men are arrived at such a degree of folly that they
would be willing to live even to the longest possible time of
life, being eager for and insatiably desirous of the greatest
extremities of misery.</p>


<p>Such evils, that which appears at first to be the lightest of
all misfortunes, namely, poverty, is naturally calculated to
produce, when it is the result of the vengeance of God; for even
though cold, and thirst, and want of food may be terrible, still
they might at times be objects worth being prayed for, if they
only produced instantaneous death without any delay. But
when they last a long time and waste away both body and soul,
then they are calculated to reproduce the very greatest of the
calamities recorded by the tragic poets, which appear to me to
be described in a spirit of fabulous exaggeration.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>Again. To free-born people slavery is a most
intolerable evil, to avoid which wise men are willing even to die,
resisting in a gallant spirit which despises all danger the
attacks of those who seek to inflict upon them the domination
of a master.</p>


<p>Also, an invincible enemy is an intolerable evil. And if the
same person be both things at once, namely, a master and an
enemy, who can endure such a complication of calamities ?
For such a person will be possessed of the power of inflicting
injury through his authority as a master, and he will be
disinclined to pardon any one by reason of his irreconcileable


<pb n="488"/>
<note type="head">488 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


enmity. Therefore the lawgiver pronounces that those persons
who neglect the sacred laws shall have their enemies for their
masters, who will treat them unmercifully, not only as having
been reduced under their power by invincible attacks, but also
as having voluntarily submitted to them through unforeseen
calamities which famine and the want of necessaries has caused ;
for some persons think it well to choose lesser evils, if by so
doing they can avoid greater ones ; if, indeed, any one of the
misfortunes above mentioned can be called a slight evil. Such
men, becoming slaves, endure the services imposed on them
by stern commands with their bodies, but when they are
oppressed as to their souls with the anguish of still more bitter
spectacles, they will sink under them; for they will see their
enemies becoming the inheritors of houses which they have
built, or of vineyards which they have planted, or of possessions
which they have acquired, enjoying the good things and stores
which have been prepared by others.</p>


<p>And they will see their enemies feasting on the fattest of
their cattle, and sacrificing them, and preparing them for the
sweetest enjoyment, without being able to deprive those persons
of anything who have thus robbed them. They will also see
their wives, whom they married in holy wedlock for the purpose
of propagating legitimate children, their modest, domestic,
affectionate wives, insulted like so many courtesans. And
they will rush forward to defend and to avenge them, but
beyond resisting they will not be able to effect anything, being
deprived of all their strength and utterly disabled; for they
will be exposed as a mark for their enemies, an object for
plunder, and ravage, and violence, and insult, and wounds, and
injuries, and contumely, and utter destruction, so that nothing
belonging to them can escape, but no one dart of the enemy
shall miss its blow, but every one of them shall be well aimed
and successful.</p>


<p>They shall be cursed in their cities and in their villages, and
cursed in their town-houses and in their dwellings in the fields.
Cursed will be their plains and all the seed which is sown in
them; cursed will be the fertile soil of the mountain district,
and all the kinds of trees which produce eatable fruit; cursed
will be their herds of cattle, for they will be rendered barren
and unproductive; cursed will be all their fruits and all their
crops, for at the most critical period of their ripening they will


<pb n="489"/>
<note type="head">ON CURSES. 489</note>


be found to be all ful of wind and destroyed. The storehouses
full of food and money shall be made exhpty; no source of
revenue shall be productive any morg; all the arts, all the
various businesses and employments, and all the innumerable
varieties of life, shall be of no use to those who adopt them ;
for the hopes of those who are anxious shall fail to be fulfilled ;
and, in short, whatever they touch, in consequence of their
wicked pursuits and wicked actions, the head, and front, and
end of which is the abandonment of the service of God, shall
all be vain and unprofitable.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>For these things are the rewards of impiety and lawless
iniquity. And, in addition to these things, there are diseases
of the body which separately afflict and devour each limb and
each part, and which also rack and torture it all over with fevers,
and chills, and wasting consumptions, and terrible rashes, and
scrofulous diseases, and spasmodic convulsions of the eyes, and
putrefying sores and abscesses, and cutaneous disorders
extending over the whole of the skin, and disorders of the bowels and
inward parts, and convulsions of the stomach, and obstructions
in the passages of the lungs preventing the patient from
breathing easily, and paralysis of the tongue, and deafness of
the ears, and imperfections of the eyes, and a general dimness
and confusion of all the other senses, things which, though
terrible, will yet hardly appear so when compared with other
things more grievous still; when, for instance, all the vivifying
qualities which existed in the blood contained in the veins have
escaped from it, and when the breath which is contained in the
lungs and windpipe is no longer capable of receiving a salutary
admixture of the outward air so nearly connected with it; and
when the veins are all relaxed and dissolved, which state is
followed by a complete prostration of the harmony and due
arrangement of the limbs, which were indeed previously
distressed by the violent rush of a briny and very bitter stream
stealthily pervading them; which, when it was shut up ina
narrow passage having no easy outlet, being then pressed close
aud pressing other parts, conduces to the production of bitter
and almost intolerable pains, from which are engendered the
diseases of gout and arthritic pains and diseases, for which no
salutary remedy has ever been discovered, but which are
incurable by any human means.</p>


<p>Some persons, when they behold these things, will be


<pb n="490"/>
<note type="head">490 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


alarmed, marvelling to see how those who a little while ago
were fat and full of good flesh, and flourishing exceedingly in
health and vigour, have so on a sudden wasted away and
become merely withered muscles and a thin skin ; and how the
women, formerly luxurious, and tender, and delicate by reason
of the luxury to which they had been accustomed from their
earliest infancy, now, from the terrible afflictions to which
they have been subjected, have become wild in their souls, and
wild-looking in their bodies.</p>


<p>Then, then indeed, their enemies shall pursue them, and the
sword shall exact its penalty ; and they, fleeing to the cities,
where they think that they have obtained a place of safety,
being deluded by treacherous hopes, shall perish to a man,
being caught and destroyed by the ambuscades of their enemies.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>And if, after all these calamities, they are not chastened,
but still proceed by crooked paths, and turn off from the
Btraight roads which lead to truth, then cowardice and fear
shall be established in their souls,<ref n="490.1"/> and they shall flee when
ho one pursues, and shall be routed and destroyed by false
teports, as does often happen. The lightest sound of leaves
falling through the air shall cause as great an agony of fear
and apprehension as the most formidable war waged by the
most powerful of enemies ought to produce, so that children
shall be indifferent to the fate of their parents, and parents to
that of their children, and brothers to that of their brethren,
looking upon it that if they go to their assistance they may
themselves incur the danger of captivity, while their best
chance of safety consists in escaping by themselves.</p>


<p>But the hopes of wicked men do never obtain their
accomplishment, and those who hope to escape thus will be still
more, or at all events not less, taken prisoners than those -
who were previously laid hold of. And even if some such
persons do escape notice, they will still be exposed to insidious
attacks from their natural enemies ; and these are those most
furious wild beasts who are well armed by the endowments of
nature, and which God, simultaneously with the original
creation of the universe, made for the purpose of striking
terror into those men who were incapable of taking warning,
and for executing implacable justice on those whose wickedness
was incurable; and those who behold their cities razed to the

<p>There shall also come upon them asthmas, and consumptions
affecting the internal organs, producing heaviness and
despondency, with great affliction, and making all life unstable,
and hanging, as one may say, from a halter. And fears
incessantly succeeding one another will toss the mind up and down,
agitating it night and day, so that in the morning they shall
pray for the evening, and in the evening they shall pray for
the morning, on account of the visible horrors which surround
them when awake, and the detestable images which present
themselves to them in their dreams when sleeping. And the
proselyte who has come over being lifted up on high by good
fortune, will be a conspicuous object, being admired and
pronounced happy in two most important particulars, in the first
place because he has come over to God of his own accord, and
also because he has received as a most appropriate reward a
firm and sure habitation in heaven, such as one cannot describe.
But the man of noble descent, who has adulterated the coinage
of his noble birth, will be dragged down to the lowest depths,
being hurled down to Tartarus and profound darkness, in
order that all men who behold this example may be corrected
by it, learning that God receives gladly virtue which grows
out of hostility to him, utterly disregarding its original roots,
but looking favourably on the whole trunk from its lowest
foundation, because it has become useful, and has changed its
nature so as to become fruitful.</p>

country, and discarded them from theiy minds; for nature
taught men the only, or to speak more securely, the first
festivals, namely, the recurring periods of seven days and
seven years, making them times of rest, the seventh day being
the period of rest for men, and the seventh year for the land.
But these men, utterly disregarding the whole of this law, and
violating all the obligations implied in salt, or treaties, or the
altar of mercy, or the common hearth, considerations by which
friendship and unanimity is usually cemented, for all such
things are either the number seven itself, or exist in
consequence of that number, oppressed (at least the more powerful
of them did so) those men who were weaker with constant and
uninterrupted commands, and they oppressed the land also,

and inflaming their desires so as to excite their unbridled and
unjust passions to an insatiable degree.</p>


<p>For instead of granting to men who are in the truest point
of view their brothers, as having one common mother, namely,
nature, instead, I say, of giving them the appointed holiday
after each period of six days, and instead of giving the land a
respite after each space of six years without oppressing it
either with sowing of seed or planting of trees, in order that it
may not be exhausted by incessant labours: instead of acting
thus, these men, neglecting all these admirable
commandments, have oppressed both the bodies and souls of all men
over whom they have had any power, with incessant severities,
and have torn to pieces the strength of the deep-soiled earth,
exacting revenues from it in an insatiable spirit beyond its
power to contribute, and crushing it out altogether and in
every part with exactions not only yearly, but even daily.</p>

and curses mentioned above: and the country being thoroughly
exhausted, and having been forced to submit to innumerable
afflictions, shall at last be relieved by being delivered from
the burden of its impious inhabitants, and when looking around
it, shall see no one left of those who destroyed its grandeur
and beauty, but shall behold the market-places all free from
their tumults, and wars, and acts of iniquity, and full of
tranquillity, and peace, and justice ; then it shall recover its youth

been fatigued by his exertions.</p>


<p>Then, like an affectionate mother, it shall pity the sons and
the daughters whom it has lost, who now that they are dead
are, and still more were, when alive, a grief and sorrow to their
parents; and becoming young a second time, it will again be
fertile as before, and will produce an irreproachable offspring,
an improvement on its former progeny ; for she that was
desolate, as the prophet says,<ref n="493.1"/> is now become happy in her children
and the mother of a large family. Which prophetic saying
has also an allegorical meaning, having reference to the zoul ;
for when the family is very large, and the soul is full, alk
kinds of passions and vices, surrounding it like so many
children, such for instance as pleasures, appetites, folly,
intemperance, injustice, it is sad and diseased; and being
exceedingly prostrate through illness, it is near to death,
but when it is barren and has no such offspring, or when it
has lost them, then it becomes changed in all its parts and
becomes a pure virgin, and having received the divine seed,
it fashions and brings to life a new family, very admirable in
their nature, and of great beauty and perfection, such as
prudence, courage, temperance, justice, holiness, piety, and ail
other virtues and good dispositions, of which not only is their
birth a blessing accompanied by happiness in its children, but
the mere expectation of such a birth is a blessing, since it
cheers its weakness by the anticipations of hope ; and hope is
joy before joy, even though it may be somewhat defective in
comparison with perfect joy. But still, it is in both these
respects better than that which comes after; first, because it
relaxes and softens the dry rigidity of care; and secondly,
because by its anticipations it gives a forewarning of the
impending perfect good.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="8"/>I have now, then, without making any concealment
or softening the truth in any degree, explained the curses and
the punishments which it is fit for those persons to endure
who have despised the sacred laws of justice and piety, and
who have submitted themselves to the adoption of polytheistic
opinions, the end of which is impiety through forgetfulness of
the instruction originally imparted to them by their
forefathers, which they learnt in their earliest infancy, when they
were taught to look upon the nature of the One as the only

supreme God, to whom alone those persons may properly be
assigned as his inheritance who pursue the genuine truth
instead of cunningly invented fables.</p>


<p>If, however, they receive these exertions of power not as
aiming at their destruction, but rather at their admonition and
improvement, and if they feel shame throughout their whole
soul, and change their ways, reproaching themselves for their
errors, and openly avowing and confessing all the sins that
they have committed against themselves with purified souls
and minds, so as in the first place to exhibit a sincerity of
conscience utterly alien from falsehood and concealing nothing
evil beneath ; and secondly, having their tongues also purified
80 as to produce improvement in their hearers, they will then
meet with a favourable acceptance from their merciful saviour,
God, who bestows on the race of mankind his especial and
exceedingly great gift, namely, relationship to his own word ;
after which, as its archetypal model, the human mind was
formed.</p>


<p>For even though they may be at the very extremities of the
earth, acting as slaves to those enemies who have led them
away in captivity, still they shall all be restored to freedom in
one day, as at a given signal; their sudden and universal
change to virtue causing a panic among their masters; for
they will let them go, because they are ashamed to govern
those who are better than themselves.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="9"/>But when they have received this unexpected liberty,
those who but a short time before were scattered about in
Greece, and in the countries of the barbarians, in the islands,
and over the continents, rising up with one impulse, and
-coming from all the different quarters imaginable, all hasten
to one place pointed out to them, being guided on their way
by some vision, more divine than is compatible with its being
of the nature of man, invisible indeed to every one else, but
apparent only to those who were saved, having their separate
inducements and intercessions, by whose intervention they
might obtain a reconciliation with the Father. First of all,
the merciful, and gentle, and compassionate nature of him who
is invoked, who would always rather have mercy than
punishment. In the second place, the holiness of all the founders
of the nation, because they, with souls emancipated from the
body, exhibiting a genuine and sincere obedience to the Ruler
of all things. are not accustomed to offer up ineffectual prayers


<pb n="495"/>
<note type="head">“ON CURSES. 495</note>


on behalf of their sons and daughters, since the Father has
given to them, as a reward, that they shall be heard in theit
prayers. And, thirdly, that quality, on account of which above
all others, the good will of the beings above-mentioned is
conciliated, and that is the improvement and amelioration of those
persons who are brought to treaties and agreements, who have,
with great difficulty, been able to come from a pathless
wilderness into a beaten road, the end of which is no other than that
of pleasing God as sons please a father. .</p>


<p>And when they come cities will be rebuilt which but a short
time ago were in complete ruins, and the desert will be filled
with inhabitants, and the barren land will change ard become
fertile, and the good fortune of their fathers and ancestors will
be looked upon as a matter of but small importance, on
account of the abundance of wealth of all kinds which they will
have at the present moment, flowing forth from the graces of
God as from ever-running fountains, which will thus confer
vast wealth separately on each individual, and also on all the
citizens in common, to an amount beyond the reach even
of envy.</p>


<p>And the change in everything will be immediate, for God
will nourish the virtues against the enemies of those who have
repented, who have delighted in the ruined fortunes of the
nation, reviling them, and making a mockery of them, as if
they themselves were destined to have a season of good
fortune, which could never be put an end to, which they hope to
leave, in regular succession, to their children and to their
posterity; thinking, at the same time, that they will for ever
behold their adversaries in lasting and unchangeable misfor
turfes, laid up for even remote future generations; not
perceiving, in their insanity, that they enjoyed that brilliant
fortune which fell to their share a little while before, not for
their own merits, but for the sake of giving a warning and
admonition to others, for whom, as they had forsaken their
national and hereditary customs, the only salutary remedy
which could be found was the grief which they felt to excess
when their enemies carried off their property.</p>


<p>Therefore, weeping for and bewailing their own defeat, they
will turn back again to the ancient prosperity of their
ancestors, retracing all their steps with great exactness, and without
its even happening to them to stray from the proper course
and to be wrecked; but they who have turned their

lamentations into ridicule, and have decided on celebrating, as public
festivals, the days which they consider unlucky, and of feasting
in memorial of matters for which they mourn, and who, in
short, make themselves happy at all the unhappiness of
others, when they begin to receive the due reward of their
inhumanity, will learn that they have sinned, not against
obscure and neglected persons, but against men of noble birth,
having fuel to kindle their nobleness to a proper warmth,
which, when it is properly fanned into a flame, then their
glory, which a little while ago appeared to be extinguished,
blazes out again.</p>


<p>For as, when the trunk of a tree is cut down, if the roots are
not taken away, new shoots spring up, by which the old trunk
is again restored to life as it were; in the very same manner,
if there be only left in the soul ever so small a seed of virtue,
when everything else is destroyed, still, nevertheless, from
that little seed there spring up the most honourable and
beautiful qualities among men; by means of which, cities,
which were formerly populous and flourishing, are again
inhabited, and nations are led to become wealthy and powerful,


A TREATISE
ON NOBILITY.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="1"/>We ought to rebuke in no measured language those who
celebrate nobility of birth as the greatest of all blessings, and
the cause also of great blessings, if in the first place they
think those men nobly born who are sprung from persons who
were rich and glorious in the days of old, when those very
ancestors themselves, from whom they boast to be descended, were not
made happy by their unlimited abundance; since, in truth,
that which is really good does not naturally or necessarily
lodge in any external thing, nor in any of the things which
belong to the body, and indeed I may even say not in every
part of the soul, but only in the dominant and most important
portion of it.</p>


<p>For when God determined to establish this in us out of his
own exceeding mercy and love for the human race, he could
not find any temple upon earth more beautiful or more suited
for its abode than reason; for the mind makes, as it were, an


<pb n="497"/>
<note type="head">ON NOBILITY. 487</note>


image of the good and consecrates it within itself, and if any
persons disbelieve in it of those who have either never tasted
-wisdom at all, or else have done so only with the edges of their
lips (for silver and gold, and honours, and offices, and vigour
and beauty of body, resemble those men who are appointed to
situations of authority and power, in order to serve virtue as if
she were their queen), never having obtained a sight of the
most brilliant of all lights.</p>


<p>Since, then, nobility of mind, perfectly purified by complete
purifications, is the proper inheritance, we ought to call those
men alone noble who are temperate and just, even though
they may be of the class of domestic slaves, or may have
been bought with money. But to those persons who, being
sprung from virtuous parents, do themselves turn out wicked,
the region of nobleness is wholly inaccessible ; for every bad
man is destitute of a house, and destitute of a city, having
been driven from his proper country, namely, virtue; which is
the real, genuine country of all wise men: and ignobleness
does of necessity attach itself to such a man, even though
he be descended from grandfathers and great grandfathers
whose lives were wholly irreproachable, since he studies to
alienate himself from them and detaches himself from and
removes to the greatest possible distance from real nobility
in all his words and actions. But moreover, besides that
wicked men cannot possibly be noble, I also see that they are
all of them irreconcileable enemies to nobility, inasmuch as
they have destroyed the reputation which accrued to them
from their ancestors, and have dimmed and extinguished all
the brilliancy which did exist in their race.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="2"/>And it is for this reason, as it appears to me, that some
most affectionate fathers disown and disinherit their sons,
cutting them off from their homes and from their kindred,
when the wickedness which is displayed in them has
overmastered the exceeding and all-pervading love which is
implanted by nature in parents. And the truth of this
assertion of mine is easy to be seen from other circumstances
also. What good could it ever be to any man that his ances.
tors had been endowed with ever such great acuteness of vision
if he himself were deprived of his eyes ? How could that fact
assist him to see? Or again, supposing a person to have an
impediment in his speech, how would his utterance be assisted



<pb n="498"/>
<note type="head">498 PHILO JUDAUS.</note>


by the fact that his parents or his grandfathers had had fine
voices? And how will a man who has been emaciated and
exhausted bya long and wasting disease, be assisted to recover
his former strength, if the original founders of his race are,
on account of their strength as athletes, enrolled among the
Olympic conquerors, or the victors at any other periodical
games? For their bodily infirmities will equally remain in
the same condition as before, not receiving any amelioration
from the successes of their relations.</p>


<p>In the same manner, just parents are of no advantage to
unjust men, nor temperate parents to intemperate children,
nor, in short, are ancestors of any kind of excellence of any
advantage to wicked descendants; for even the laws
themselves are of no advantage to those who transgress them, as
they are meant to punish them, and what is it that we ought
to look upon as unwritten laws, except the lives of those
persons who have imitated virtue? On which account, I
imagine, that nobility herself, if God were to invest her with
the form and organs of a man, would stand before fhose
obstinate and unworthy descendants and speak thus: “ Relationship
is not measured by blood alone, where truth is the judge, but
by a similarity of actions, and by a careful imitation of the
conduct of your ancestors. But you have pursued an opposite
line of conduct, thinking hateful such actions as are dear to
me, and loving such deeds as are hateful to me; for in my
eyes modesty, and truth, and moderation, and a due
government of the passions, and simplicity, and innocence, are
honourable, but in your opinion they are dishonourable; and
to me all shameless behaviour is hateful, and all falsehood, and
all immoderate indulgence of the passions, and all pride, and
all wickedness. But you look upon these things as near and
dear to you. Why, then, do you, when by your actions you
show all possible eagerness to alienate yourselves from them,
sheltering yourselves under a plausible name, hypocriticlaly
pretend in words to a relationship? For I cannot endure
seductive insinuations falsely put on, or any deceit; because
it is easy for any persons to find out specious arguments, but
it is not easy to change an evil disposition into a good one.


“ And I, looking therefore at these facts, both now consider
and shall always think those persons who have kindled sparks
of enmity my enemies, and I shall look upon them with more
suspicion than upon those who have been reproached openly


<pb n="499"/>
<note type="head">ON NOBILITY. 499</note>


for want of nobility; for they, indeed, have this to allege in
their defence, that they have no connection at all with
excellence. But you are justly liable to punishment who act thus
after having been born of noble houses, and being fond of
making your boast of your noble descent, and of looking upon
it as your glory ; for, though archetypal models of virtue have
been established in close connection with, and in a manner
implanted in you, you have determined to give no good impression
of them yourselves. But that nobility is placed only in the
acquisition of virtue, and that you ought to imagine that he
who has that is the only man really noble, and not the man
who is born of noble and virtuous parents, is plain from many
circumstances.”


<milestone unit="chapter" n="3"/>Again, who is there who would deny that those men
who were born of him who was made out of the earth were
noble themselves, and the founders of noble families? persons
who have received a birth more excellent than that of any
succeeding generation, in being sprung from the first wedded
pair, from the first man and woman, who then for the first time
came together for the propagation of offspring resembling
themselves. But, nevertheless, when there were two persons
so born, the elder of them endured to slay the younger ;<ref n="499.1"/> and,
having committed the great and most accursed crime of
fratricide, he first defiled the ground with human blood. Now, what
good did the nobility of his birth do to a man who had displayed
this want of nobleness in his soul? which God, who surveys
all human things and actions, detested when he saw it; and,
casting it forth, affixed a punishment to it, not slaying him at
once, so that he should arrive at an immediate insensibility to
misfortunes, but suspending over him ten thousand deaths in
his external senses, by means of incessant griefs and fears, so
as to inflict upon him the sense of the most grievous
calamities.</p>


<p>Now there was, in the subsequent generations, a man very
greatly approved of, a most holy man, whose piety the sacred
historian, who has written the books called the law, has
thought worthy of being recorded in the sacred volumes,
Accordingly, in the great deluge when all the cities of the
world were utterly destroyed (for even the highest mountains
were overwhelmed by the increase and continual rising of the

rapid flood), he alone was saved, with all his kindred, having
received such a reward for his virtue that it is not possible to
imagine a greater one.<ref n="500.1"/></p>


<p>This man, again, had three sons; and, though they had had
their share in the blessing thus bestowed upon their father, one
of them dared to turn his father, the cause of his safety, into
ridicule, laughing at him, and mocking and reviling him,
because of an error which he committed unintentionally, and
displaying to those who did not see it what he ought to have
concealed, so as to bring disgrace on him who had begotten
him.<ref n="500.2"/> Therefore, having now fallen from his brilliant nobility
of birth and having become accursed, and having also become
the beginning of misery to all his posterity, he suffered all those
evils which it was fitting for a man to suffer who had
disregarded all the honour due to his parents.</p>


<p>But why should I speak of these men, and pass over the first
man who was.created out of the earth? who, in respect of the
nobleness of his birth can be compared to no mortal whatever,
inasmuch as he was fashioned by the hand of God, and invested
with a form in the likeness of a human body by the very
perfection of all plastic art. And he was also thought worthy of a
soul, which was derived from no being who had as yet come
into existence by being created, but God breathed into him as
much of his own power as mortal nature was capable of receiving.
Was it not, then, a perfect excess of all nobleness, which could
not possibly come into comparison with any other which is ever
spoken of as favours? for all persons who lay claim to that
kind of eminence rest their claims on the nobility of their
ancestors.</p>


<p>But even those men who have been their ancestors were
only animals, subject to disease and to corruption, and their
prosperity was, for the most part, very unstable. But the
father of this man was no mortal at all, and the sole author of
his being was God. And he, being in a manner his image and
likeness according to the dominant mind in the soul, though it
wes his duty to preserve that image free from all spot or
blemish, following and imitating as far as was in his power the
virtues of him who had created him, since the two opposite
qualities of good and evil (what is honourable and what is
disgraceful, what is true and what is false) were set before him
for his choice and avoidance, deliberately chose what was false,


<note n="500.1"> Genesis vii. 1.  </note>
<note n="500.2">Genesis ix. 22.
</note>


<pb n="501"/>
<note type="head">ON NOBILITY.: 501</note>


and disgraceful, and evil, and despised what was good, and
honourable, and true ; for which conduct he was very fairly
condemned to change an immortal for a mortal existence, being
deprived of blessedness and happiness, and therefore he
naturally was changed so as to descend into a laborious and
miserable life.<ref n="501.1"/></p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="4"/>But, however, let these men be set down as common
rules and limits for all men, in order to prevent them from
priding themselves on their noble birth, and so departing from
and losing the rewards of excellence. But there are also other
especial rules given to the Jews besides the common ones
which are applicable to all mankind; for they are derived from
the original founders of the nation, to whom the virtues of their
ancestors were absolutely of no benefit at all, inasmuch as they
were detected in blameable and guilty actions, and were
convicted, if not by any other human being, at all events by their
own consciences, which is the sole tribunal in the world which
is never led away by any artifices of speech.</p>


<p>The first. man of them had a numerous family, inasmuch as
he had children by three wives, not forming these connections
for the sake of pleasure, but because of his hope of multiplying
his race. But, of all his children, one alone was appointed to
be the inheritor of his father’s possessions; and all the rest,
being disappointed of their reasonable hopes, and having failed
to obtain any portion whatever of their father’s wealth, departed
to live in different countries, having been completely alienated
from that celebrated nobility of birth.</p>


<p>Again, to the one who was approved of as the heir, there
were born two sons, twins, resembling one another in no
particular except in the hands, and even in them only by some
especial providence of God, inasmuch as they were alike
neither in their bodies nor in their minds, for the younger one
was obedient to both his parents, and was really amiable and
pleasing, so that he obtained the praises even of God; while
the elder was disobedient, being intemperate in respect of the
pleasures of the belly and of the parts beneath the belly, by
a regard for which he was induced even to part with his
birthright, as far as he himself was concerned, though he repented
immediately afterwards of the conditions on which he had
forfeited it, and sought to slay his brother, and, in fact, to do
everything imaginable by which he could be likely to pain his


<note n="501.1"> Genesis iii, 19.
</note>


<pb n="502"/>
<note type="head">502 PHILO JUDZUS.</note>


parents; therefore they, in the first place, offered up prayers
for his brother to the supreme God, who accepted them, and
who did not choose to leave any one of them unaccomplished ;
while to the others they gave, out of compassion, a subordinate
rank, appointing that he should serve his brother, thinking, as
indeed is the truth, that the fact of not being his own master,
is good for a wicked man.</p>


<p>And if the elder brother had cheerfully submitted to the
servitude, he would have been thought worthy of a secondary
reward, as having come off second in a contest of virtue; but
as the case stands, having behaved in a self-willed manner, and
having refused to submit to servitude, he became the cause of
great reproach, both to himself and to his descendants, so that
his miserable life has been indelibly recorded for a most
manifest proof that nobility of birth is of no service whatever to
those who do not deserve to have it.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="5"/>These men therefore are both of that class which is
open to reproach; men whom, as they showed themselves
wicked men,though descended from virtuous fathers, the virtues
of their fathers failed to profit in the least, while the vices
which existed in their souls did them infinite mischief; and I
can also speak of others, who, on the contrary, ranged
themselves in a better class, after having been born in a worse,
since their forefathers were guilty, while their own life was to
be admired and was full of praise and virtue.</p>


<p>The most ancient person of the Jewish nation was a
Chaldean by birth, born of a father who was very skilful in
astronomy, and famous among those men who pass their lives in
the study of mathematics, who look upon the stars as gods, and
worship the whole heaven and the whole world; thinking, that
from them do all good and all evil proceed, to every individual
among men; as they do not conceive that there is any cause
whatever, except such as are included among the objects of
the outward senses. Now what can be more horrible than
this? What can more clearly show the innate ignobleness of
the soul, which, by consequence of its knowledge of the
generality of things, of secondary causes, and of things created,
proceeds onwards to ignorance of the one most ancient
uncreated Being, the Creator of the universe, and who is most
excellent on this account, and for many other reasons also,
which the human reason is unable to comprehend by reason
of their magnitude ?


<pb n="503"/>
<note type="head">ON NOBILITY. 503</note>


But this man, having formed a proper conception of him in
his mind, and being under the influence of inspiration, left his
country, and his family, and his father’s house, well knowing
that, if he remained among them, the deceitful fancies of the
polytheistic doctrine abiding there likewise, must render his
mind incapable of arriving at the proper discovery of the one
true God, who is the only everlasting God and the Father of
all other things, whether appreciable only by the intellect or
perceptible by the outward senses; while, on the other hand,
he saw, that if he rose up and quitted his native land, deceit
would also depart from his mind, changing his false opinions
into true belief.</p>


<p>At the same time, also, the divine oracles of God which
were imparted to him excited still further that desire which
longed to attain to a knowledge of the living God, by which he
was guided, and thus went forth with most unhesitating
earnestness to the investigation of the one God. And he never
desisted from this investigation till he arrived at a more
distinct perception, not indeed of his essence, for that is
impossible, but of his existence, and of his over-ruling providence as
far as it can be allowed to man to attain to such; for which
reason he is the first person who is said to have believed in
God,<ref n="503.1"/> since he was the first who had an unswerving and firm
comprehension of him, apprehending that there is one supreme
cause, and that he it is which governs the world by his
providence, and all the things that are therein. And having
attained to a most firm comprehension of the virtues, he
acquired at the same time all the other virtues and
excellencies also, so that he was looked upon as a king by those
who received him,<ref n="503.2"/> not indeed in respect of his appointments,
for he was only a private individual, but in his magnanimity
and greatness of soul, inasmuch as he was of a royal spirit.</p>


<p>For, indeed, his servants at all times steadfastly observed
him, as subjects observe a ruler, looking with admiration at
the universal greatness of his nature and disposition, which
was more perfect than is customary to meet with in a man;
for he did not use the same conversation as ordinary men, but,
like one inspired, spoke in general in more dignified language.</p>


<p>Whenever, therefore, he was possessed by the Holy Spirit he
at once changed everything for the better, his eyes and his


<note n="503.1"> Genesis xv. 6.</note>

complexion, and his size and his appearance while standing,
and his motions, and his voice; the Holy Spirit, which, being
breathed into him from above, took up its lodging in his soul,
clothing his body with extraordinary beauty, and investing his
words with persuasiveness at the same time that it endowed
his hearers with understanding.</p>


<p>Would not any one, then, be quite correct to say that this
man who thus left his native land, who thus forsook all his
relations and all his friends, was the most nobly related of all
men, as aiming at making himself a kinsman of God, and
labouring by every means in his power to become his disciple
and friend? And that he was deservedly ranked in the very
highest class among the prophets, because he trusted in no
created being in preference to the uncreated God, the Father
of all? And being honoured as king, as I have said before, by
those who received him among them, not as having obtained
his authority by warlike arms, or by armed hosts, as some
persons have done, but having received his appointment from
the all-righteous God, who honours the lovers of piety with
independent authority, to the great advantage of all who are
associated with them.</p>


<p>This man is the standard of nobleness to all who come to
settle in a foreign land, leaving that ignobleness which
attaches to them from foreign laws and unbecoming customs,
which give honours, such as are due only to God, to stocks, and
to stones, and, in short, to all kinds of inanimate things; and
who have thus come over to a constitution really full of vitality
and life, the president and governor of which is truth.</p>


<p><milestone unit="chapter" n="6"/>This nobleness has been an object of desire not only
to God-loving men, but likewise to women, who have discarded
the ignorance in which they have been bred up, which taught
them to honour, as deities, creatures made with hands, and have
learnt instead that knowledge of there being only one supreme
Ruler of the universe, by whom the whole world is governed
and regulated; for Tamar was a woman from Syria Palestina,
who had been bred up in her own native city, which was
devoted to the worship of many gods, being full of statues, and
images, and, in short, of idols of every kind and description.
But when she, emerging, as it were, out of profound darkness,
was able to see a slight beam of truth, she then, at the risk of
her life, exerted all her energies to arrive at piety, caring little
for life if she could not live virtuously ; and living virtuously


<pb n="505"/>
<note type="head">ON NOBILITY. 505</note>


was exactly identical with living for the service of and in
constant supplication to the one true God.</p>


<p>And yet she, having married two wicked brothers in turn,
one after the other, first of all the one who was the husband of
her virginity, and lastly him who succeeded to her by the law
which enjoined such a marriage, in the case of the first
husband not having left any family, but nevertheless, having
preserved her own life free from all stain, was able to attain to
that fair reputation which falls to the lot of the good, and to
be the beginning of nobleness to all those who came after her.</p>


<p>But even though she was a foreigner still she was
nevertheless a freeborn woman, and born also of freeborn parents of no
insignificant importance; but her handmaidens were born of
parents who lived on the other side of the Euphrates on the
extremities of the country of Babylon, such as were given as
part of their dowry to maidens of high rank when they were
married, but still were often thought worthy to be taken to the
bed of a wise man; and so they first of all were raised from
the title of concubines to the name and dignity of wives, and
in a short time, I may almost say, instead of being looked upon
as handmaidens they were raised to an equality in point of
dignity and consideration with their mistresses, and, which is the
most extraordinary circumstance of all, were even invited by
their mistresses to this position and dignity.


. For envy does not dwell in the souls of the wise, and
whenever that is not present they all have all things in common,


And the illegitimate sons borne by those handmaidens
differed in no respect from the legitimate children of the real
wives, not only in the eyes of the father who begot them, for
it is not at all surprising if he who was the father of them all
displayed an equal degree of good-will to them all, since they
were all equally his children; but they also were equally
esteemed ‘by their stepmothers. For they, laying aside all
that dislike which women so commonly feel towards their
stepsons, changed it into an unceasing affection with which
they united themselves to them. And the stepsons, showing
a reciprocal good will to them, honoured their stepmothers as
if they had been their natural mothers. And their brothers,
being separated from them only by the mixture in their blood,
nevertheless did not think them worthy of only a half degree

made themselves, and if on the contrary no honour is to be
assigned to those who have become good though born of wicked
parents, though the law judges each man by himself, and does
not praise or blame any one with reference to the virtues or
vices of his ancestors. </p>
