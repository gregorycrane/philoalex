          </head>
          <p>THE author of the following Treatises was, as the title by <lb/>
            which he is generally known imports, of Jewish extraction, <lb/>
            and a descendant of the sacerdotal tribe of Levi. He is <lb/>
            spoken of by Josephus as one of the most eminent of his <lb/>
            contemporary countrymen, and as the principal of the em­ <lb/>
            bassy which was sent to Caligula to solicit him to recall the <lb/>
            command which he had issued for the erection of his statue <lb/>
            in the temple at Jerusalem. The embassy was unsuccessful, <lb/>
            though the death of the emperor saved the sacred edifice <lb/>
            from the meditated profanation; but we see that Philo <lb/>
            suffered no diminution of his credit from its unsuccessful <lb/>
            result, since, at a subsequent period, his son, Tiberius <lb/>
            Alexander, married Berenice, the daughter of King Agrippa.</p>
          <p>The date of his birth and that of his death are alike uncer­ <lb/>
            tain; he speaks of himself as an old man when the embassy to <lb/>
            Rome took place; and the treatise in which he gives an <lb/>
            account of it was apparently written in the reign of Clau­ <lb/>
            dius, who succeeded Caligula A.D. 41, and reigned nearly <lb/>
            fourteen years. His chief residence was at Alexandria, <lb/>
            which at that period was, next to Athens, the most cele­ <lb/>
            brated seat of philosophy in the world, and which had long <lb/>
            been a favourite abode of the learned Jews. On one occa­ <lb/>
            sion he mentions having visited Jerusalem ; and this is all <lb/>
            we know of his personal history.</p>
          <p>In his religious opinions he appears to have been a Pha­ <lb/>
            risee, to the principles of which sect some portion of his <lb/>
            fondness for allegorical interpretation may perhaps be <lb/>
            owing.</p>
          <p>It was, however, rather to his philosophical labours that <lb/>
            his celebrity among his contemporaries and his notoriety at <lb/>
            the present day are mainly owing. He was so devoted a <lb/>
            follower of the great founder of the Academic school, that it <lb/>
            appears. to have been a saying among the ancients that, <lb/>
            “ either Plato Philonises, or philo platonises." And there <lb/>
            are many doctrines asserted in the following treatises which <lb/>
            can be clearly traced to the principles and even to the <lb/>
            extant works of the son of Ariston; and it is in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of this tendency that be is spoken of as the first of <lb/>
             <pb n="IV"/>
            the Neo-Platonists, that is to say, of that school which <lb/>
            attempted to reconcile the doctrines of the Greek, and more <lb/>
            especially of the Academic, philosophy with the revelations <lb/>
            contained in the sacred scriptures, while, at the same time, <lb/>
            he transferred into the Platonic system many of the opinions <lb/>
            which he borrowed from the East.</p>
          <p>According to the manner of the Eclectics, however, he <lb/>
            mingled with his Platonism many doctrines derived from <lb/>
            other schools, and those of Pythagoras in particular, to such <lb/>
            an extent, that Clemens, of Alexandria, calls him a Pytha­ <lb/>
            gorean, not recollecting that Aristotle tells us, that the <lb/>
            Academy harmonized in very many points with the philo­ <lb/>
            sophy of Cortona. In many points, again, especially in the <lb/>
            supremacy which he assigns to virtue, he betrays an inclina­ <lb/>
            tion to the principles of the Stoics.</p>
          <p>The attempt to reconcile the heathen philosophy with the <lb/>
            Bible was not altogether new. As early as the time of <lb/>
            Ptolemy Lagus, many Jews had been settled in Alexandria; <lb/>
            and, at the period when Philo flourished, they are supposed <lb/>
            to have formed half the population of that city — the <lb/>
            splendid library of which opened to the learned men of their <lb/>
            nation those stores of Greek wisdom and eloquence with <lb/>
            which they were previously unacquainted ; and as they could <lb/>
            not fail to be struck with the truth of many of the principles <lb/>
            which they found laid down in those works, it was not unnatu­ <lb/>
            ral that, being also formerly convinced of the divine origin <lb/>
            of their own scriptures, they should endeavour to reconcile <lb/>
            two systems, both of which appeared in so great a degree to <lb/>
            rest on the same foundation. The truth of their own books <lb/>
            they knew to proceed from divine revelation; that of the <lb/>
            Greek philosophers they looked upon as an efflux more or <lb/>
            less remote from that revelation, and the pride of human intel­ <lb/>
            lect led them to endeavour to display their superior penetra­ <lb/>
            tion by discerning a hidden sense in their own scriptures, <lb/>
            which should contain the germ of the Greek philosophy.</p>
          <p>Of all the writers of this school the most eminent was <lb/>
            Philo, and his works are highly interesting as showing us <lb/>
            the manner in which the Sophists of his age and nation <lb/>
            sought to appropriate the Greek philosophy by an allegorical <lb/>
            interpretation of the works of Moses, which they thus repre­ <lb/>
            sented as containing all the principles which the Greeks <lb/>
             <pb n="V"/>
            subsequently expanded into the precise doctrines of their <lb/>
            several sects. Accordingly, he represents Jehovah as a <lb/>
            single uncompounded Being ; unchangeable, eternal, incom­ <lb/>
            prehensible, the knowledge of whom is to be looked upon <lb/>
            as the ultimate object of all human efforts. He teaches <lb/>
            that visible phænomena are to lead men over to the invisible <lb/>
            world, and that the contemplation of the world so wonder- <lb/>
            fully and beautifully made proves a wise and intelligent <lb/>
            Cause and Creator of it. Having adopted, however, the <lb/>
            Epicurean doctrine, that nothing can be produced out of <lb/>
            nothing, he also assumed the existence of a mass of lifeless <lb/>
            matter, passive and primeval, destitute of quality and form, <lb/>
            but containing within itself the four primary elements ; and <lb/>
            of this mass, he looked upon the Spirit of God as the divider <lb/>
            and fashioner into distinct shape.</p>
          <p>Matter again he conceived as something subordinate to, <lb/>
            and at the same time resisting, the divine arrangement, and <lb/>
            in this latter character as the source of all imperfection and <lb/>
            evil. Moreover, not having arrived at any just notion of the <lb/>
            Deity as the immediate cause of the existence of the world, <lb/>
            he assumed the existence of an intermediate cause which he <lb/>
            called the Logos ; and he also imagined an invisible world, ap­ <lb/>
            preciable only by the intellect, as the pattern of the visible <lb/>
            world in which we live; carrying out his theory so as to <lb/>
            give an outline of that doctrine of emanations, which at a <lb/>
            later period was elaborated and fully developed by the <lb/>
            Gnostics.</p>
          <p>The treatises contained in the present volume refer to <lb/>
            the books of Moses. At the beginning of the first, that on <lb/>
            the Creation of the World, he intimates that his object is to <lb/>
            show how the law and the world accord with one another, <lb/>
            and how the man who lives according to the law is as such <lb/>
            a citizen of the world. For Moses, as he remarks in his <lb/>
            treatise on the life of that prophet, demonstrates in his <lb/>
            history that the same Being is the Father and Creator of <lb/>
            the universe, and the true lawgiver of the world ; and ac­ <lb/>
            cordingly, that whoever follows his laws is adapting himself <lb/>
            to the course of nature and living in harmony with the <lb/>
            general laws of the universe; while again, the man who <lb/>
            transgresses those laws is punished by the operations of <lb/>
            nature, such as floods, fire from heaven, and such means.</p><pb n="VI"/>
            
          <p>In his treatise on the Laws, lie divides them into what he <lb/>
            looks upon as unwritten laws, that is to say, the living <lb/>
            patterns of a blameless life which the scripture sets before <lb/>
            us in Enoch, Noah, Abraham, &amp;c., and particular laws in the <lb/>
            narrower technical common acceptation of the word.</p>
          <p>In the other treatises, he deduces all allegorical meaning <lb/>
            from the plain historical account of Moses, which serves him <lb/>
            as the foundation for his philosophical system.</p>
          <p>In all these works he exhibits profound and varied learn­ <lb/>
            ing, showing himself deeply versed in Greek literature of <lb/>
            every age and description, and of considerable skill in the <lb/>
            sciences of music, geometry, and astronomy. His style is <lb/>
            clear, and even though he may at times be open to the <lb/>
            charge of an over-refined subtilty, it is impossible to deny <lb/>
            him the praise of acuteness and ingenuity, set off to their <lb/>
            best advantage by neatness of language and felicity of ex­ <lb/>
            pression.</p>
          <p>For the Christian reader these treatises have a peculiar <lb/>
            interest from the ample materials which many of them <lb/>
            furnish for the illustration of St. Paul's Epistles ; materials <lb/>
            so copious and so valuable that an eminent divine of the <lb/>
            present day has pronounced an opinion (referring probably <lb/>
            more especially to the treatises on the Sacrifices of Abel and <lb/>
            of Cain-on the Different Incidents in the Life of Noah— <lb/>
            on Abraham—on the Life of Moses—on the Ten Command­ <lb/>
            ments—and on Providence) that all the other ancient <lb/>
            commentators on the Scriptures put together have not left <lb/>
            works of greater value for that most important object. It <lb/>
            is even asserted by Eusebius that he formed an acquaintance <lb/>
            with St. Peter while at Rome, but that statement is gene­ <lb/>
            rally looked upon as wanting confirmation. From his <lb/>
            treatise against Flaccus, and in that which refers to his <lb/>
            embassy to Rome, we likewise derive information with <lb/>
            respect to the condition of the Jews in the time of our <lb/>
            Saviour, and to the manner in which they were treated by <lb/>
            the Roman governors, which supplies much incidental cor­ <lb/>
            roboration of some of the historical allusions contained in <lb/>
            different parts of the New Testament.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE THE ACCOUNT OF ON OF THE WORLD, THE CREATION AS GIVEN BY MOSES.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. OF other lawgivers, some have set forth what they con­ <lb/>
            sidered to be just and reasonable, in a naked and unadorned <lb/>
            manner, while others, investing their ideas with an abundance <lb/>
            of amplification, have sought to bewilder the people, by burying <lb/>
            the truth under a heap of fabulous inventions. But Moses, <lb/>
            rejecting both of these methods, the one as inconsiderate, <lb/>
            careless, and unphilosophical, and the other as mendacious <lb/>
            and full of trickery, made the beginning of his laws entirely <lb/>
            beautiful, and in all respects admirable, neither at once <lb/>
            declaring what ought to be done or the contrary, nor (since it was <lb/>
            necessary to mould beforehand the dispositions of those who <lb/>
            were to use his laws) inventing fables himself or adopting <lb/>
            those which had been invented by others.</p>
          <p>And his exordium, as I have already said, is most admi­ <lb/>
            rable ; embracing the creation of the world, under the idea <lb/>
            that the law corresponds to the world and the world to the <lb/>
            law, and that a man who is obedient to the law, being, by so <lb/>
            doing, a citizen of the world, arranges his actions with refe­ <lb/>
            rence to the intention of nature, in harmony with which the <lb/>
            whole universal world is regulated. Accordingly no one, whether <lb/>
            poet or historian, could ever give expression in an adequate <lb/>
            manner to the beauty of his ideas respecting the creation of <lb/>
            the world; for they surpass all the power of language, and <lb/>
            amaze. our hearing, being too great and venerable to be <lb/>
            adapted to the senses of any created being. That, however, <lb/>
            is not a reason for our yielding to indolence on the subject, <lb/>
            but rather from our affection for the Deity we ought to en­ <lb/>
            deavour to exert ourselves even beyond our powers in describ­ <lb/>
            ing them : not as having much, or indeed anything to say of <note type="footnote"> B </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="2"/>
            our own, but instead of much, just a little, such as it may be <lb/>
            probable that human intellect may attain to, when wholly <lb/>
            occupied with a love of and desire for wisdom.</p>
          <p>For as the smallest seal receives imitations of things or <lb/>
            colossal magnitude when engraved upon it, so perchance in <lb/>
            some instances the exceeding beauty of the description of the <lb/>
            creation of the world as recorded in the Law, overshadowing <lb/>
            with its brilliancy the souls of those who happen to meet with <lb/>
            it, will be delivered to a more concise record after these facts <lb/>
            have been first premised which it would be improper to pass <lb/>
            over in silence.</p>
          <p>II. For some men, admiring the world itself rather than <lb/>
            the Creator of the world, have represented it as existing with­ <lb/>
            out any maker, and eternal; and as impiously as falsely <lb/>
            have represented God as existing in a state of complete inac­ <lb/>
            tivity, while it would have been right on the other hand to <lb/>
            marvel at the might of God as the creator and father of all, <lb/>
            and to admire the world in a degree not exceeding the bounds <lb/>
            of moderation.</p>
          <p>ButMoses, who had early reached the very summits of philoso­ <lb/>
            phy,* and who had learnt from the oracles of God the most nume­ <lb/>
            rous and important of the principles of nature, was well aware <lb/>
            that it is indispensable that in all existing things there must <lb/>
            be an active cause, and a passive subject; and that the active <lb/>
            cause is the intellect of the universe, thoroughly unadulterated <lb/>
            and thoroughly unmixed, superior to virtue and superior to <lb/>
            science, superior even to abstract good or abstract beauty; <lb/>
            while the passive subject is something inanimate and incapable <lb/>
            of motion by any intrinsic power of its own, but having been <lb/>
            set in motion, and fashioned, and endowed with life by the <lb/>
            intellect, became transformed into that most perfect work, this <lb/>
            world. And those who describe it as being uncreated, do, <lb/>
            without being aware of it, cut off the most useful and necessary <lb/>
            of all the qualities which tend to produce piety, namely, provi­ <lb/>
            dence : for reason proves that the father and creator has a <lb/>
            care for that which has been created ; for a father is anxious <lb/>
            for the life of his children, and a workman aims at the dura­ <lb/>
            tion of his works, and employs every device imaginable to <note type="footnote"> * This is in accordance with the description of him in the Bible, <lb/>
            where he is represented as being learned in all the wisdom of the <lb/>
            Egyptians. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="3"/>
            ward off everything that is pernicious or injurious, and is de­ <lb/>
            sirous by every means in his power to provide everything <lb/>
            which is useful or profitable for them. But with regard to <lb/>
            that which has not been created, there is no feeling of interest <lb/>
            as if it were his own in the breast of him who has not cre­ <lb/>
            ated it.</p>
          <p>It is then a pernicious doctrine, and one for which no one <lb/>
            should contend, to establish a system in this world, such as <lb/>
            anarchy is in a city, so that it should have no superintendant, <lb/>
            or regulator, or judge, by whom everything must be managed <lb/>
            and governed.</p>
          <p>But the great Moses, thinking that a thing which has not <lb/>
            been uncreated is as alien as possible from that which is visible <lb/>
            before our eyes (for everything which is the subject of our ^ <lb/>
            senses exists in birth and in changes, and is not always in the <lb/>
            same condition), has attributed eternity to that which is in­ <lb/>
            visible and discerned only by our intellect as a kinsman and a <lb/>
            brother, while of that which is the object of our external <lb/>
            senses he had predicated generation as an appropriate descrip­ <lb/>
            tion. Since, then, this world is visible and the object of our <lb/>
            external senses, it follows of necessity that it must have been <lb/>
            created ; on which account it was not without a wise purpose <lb/>
            that he recorded its creation, giving a very venerable account <lb/>
            of God.</p>
          <p>III. And he says that the world was made in six days, not <lb/>
            because the Creator stood in need of a length of time (for it is <lb/>
            natural that God should do everything at once, not merely by <lb/>
            uttering a command, but by even thinking of it); but because <lb/>
            the things created required arrangement; and number is akin <lb/>
            to arrangement; and, of all numbers, six is, by the laws of <lb/>
            nature, the most productive : for of all the numbers, from the <lb/>
            unit upwards, it is the first perfect one, being made equal to <lb/>
            its parts, and being made complete by them ; the number <lb/>
            three being half of it, and the number two a third of it, and <lb/>
            the unit a sixth of it, and, so to say, it is formed so as to be <lb/>
            both male and female, and is made up of the power of both <lb/>
            natures; for in existing things the odd number is the male, <lb/>
            and the even number is the female; accordingly, of odd num­ <lb/>
            bers the first is the number three, and of even numbers the <lb/>
            first is two, and the two numbers multiplied together make six. <lb/>
            It was fitting therefore, that the world, being the most perfect <note type="footnote"> B 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="4"/>
            of created things, should be made according to the perfect <lb/>
            number, namely, six: and, as it was to have in it the causes <lb/>
            of both, which arise from combination, that it should be formed <lb/>
            according to a mixed number, the first combination of odd and <lb/>
            even numbers, since it was to embrace the character both of <lb/>
            the male who sows the seed, and of the female who receives it. <lb/>
            And he allotted each of the six days to one of the portions of <lb/>
            the whole, taking out the first day, which he does not even call <lb/>
            the first day, that it may not be numbered with the others, but <lb/>
            entitling it one, he names it rightly, perceiving in it, and <lb/>
            ascribing to it the nature and appellation of the limit.</p>
          <p>IV. We must mention as much as we can of the matters <lb/>
            contained in his account, since to enumerate them all is im­ <lb/>
            possible ; for he embraces that beautiful world which is percep­ <lb/>
            tible only by the intellect, as the account of the first day will <lb/>
            show: for God, as apprehending beforehand, as a God mus' <lb/>
            do, that there could not exist a good imitation without a good <lb/>
            model, and that of the things perceptible to the external <lb/>
            senses nothing could be faultless which was not fashioned with <lb/>
            reference to some archetypal idea conceived by the intellect, <lb/>
            when he had determined to create this visible world, previously <lb/>
            formed that one which is perceptible only by the intellect, in <lb/>
            order that so using an incorporeal model formed as far as pos­ <lb/>
            sible on the image of God. he might then make this corporeal <lb/>
            world, a younger likeness of the elder creation, which should <lb/>
            embrace as many different genera perceptible to the external <lb/>
            senses, as the other world contains of those which are visible <lb/>
            only to the intellect.</p>
          <p>But that world which consists of ideas, it were impious in <lb/>
            any degree to attempt to describe or even to imagine : but <lb/>
            how it was created, we shall know if we take for our guide a <lb/>
            certain image of the things which exist among us.</p>
          <p>When any city is founded through the exceeding ambition <lb/>
            of some king or leader who lays claim to absolute authority, <lb/>
            and is at the same time a man of brilliant imagination, eager <lb/>
            to display his good fortune, then it happens at times that some <lb/>
            man coming up who, from his education, is skilful in archi­ <lb/>
            tecture, and he, seeing the advantageous character and beauty <lb/>
            of the situation, first of all sketches out in his own mind <lb/>
            nearly all the parts of the city which is about to be com­ <lb/>
            pleted—the temples, the gymnasia, the prytanea, the markets, <lb/>
             <pb n="5"/>
            the harbour, the docks, the streets, the arrangement of the <lb/>
            walls, the situations of the dwelling houses, and of the public <lb/>
            and other buildings. Then, having received in his own mind, <lb/>
            as on a waxen tablet, the form of each building, he carries in <lb/>
            his heart the image of a city, perceptible as yet only by the <lb/>
            intellect, the images of which he stirs up in memory which is <lb/>
            innate in him, and, still further, engraving them in his mind <lb/>
            like a good workman, keeping his eyes fixed on his model, he <lb/>
            begins to raise the city of stones and wood, making the corpo­ <lb/>
            real substances to resemble each of the incorporeal ideas. <lb/>
            Now we must form a somewhat similar opinion of God, who, <lb/>
            having determined to found a mighty state, first of all con­ <lb/>
            ceived its form in his mind, according to which form he made <lb/>
            a world perceptible only by the intellect, and then completed <lb/>
            one visible to the external senses, using the first one as a <lb/>
            model.</p>
          <p>V. As therefore the city, when previously shadowed out in <lb/>
            the mind of the man of architectural skill had no external <lb/>
            place, but was stamped solely in the mind of the workman, so <lb/>
            in the same manner neither can the world which existed in <lb/>
            ideas have had any other local position except the divine <lb/>
            reason which made them ; for what other place could there be <lb/>
            for his powers which should be able to receive and contain, I <lb/>
            do not say all, but even any single one of them whatever, in <lb/>
            its simple form ? And the power and faculty which could be <lb/>
            capable of creating the world, has for its origin that good which <lb/>
            is founded on truth ; for if any one were desirous to investi­ <lb/>
            gate the cause on account of which this universe was created, I <lb/>
            think that he would come to no erroneous conclusion if he <lb/>
            were to say as one of the ancients did say : " That the Father <lb/>
            and Creator was good ; on which account he did not grudge the <lb/>
            substance a share of his own excellentnature,since it had nothing <lb/>
            good of itself, but was able to become everything." For the <lb/>
            substance was of itself destitute of arrangement, of quality, of <lb/>
            animation, of distinctive character, and full of all disorder and <lb/>
            confusion; and it received a change and transformation to <lb/>
            what is opposite to this condition, and most excellent, being <lb/>
            invested with order, quality, animation, resemblance, identity, <lb/>
            arrangement, harmony, and everything which belongs to the <lb/>
            more excellent idea.</p>
          <p>VI. And God, not being urged on by any prompter (for <lb/>
             <pb n="6"/>
            who else could there have been to prompt him ?) but guided <lb/>
            by his own sole will, decided that it was fitting to benefit with <lb/>
            unlimited and abundant favours a nature which, without the <lb/>
            divine gift, was unable of itself to partake of any good thing; <lb/>
            but he benefits it, not according to the greatness of his own <lb/>
            graces, for they are illimitable and eternal, but according to <lb/>
            the power of that which is benefited to receive his graces. <lb/>
            For the capacity of that which is created to receive benefits <lb/>
            does not correspond to the natural power of God to confer <lb/>
            them; since his powers are infinitely greater, and the thing <lb/>
            created being not sufficiently powerful to receive all their <lb/>
            greatness would have sunk under it, if he had not measured <lb/>
            his bounty, allotting to each, in due proportion, that which was <lb/>
            poured upon it. And if any one were to desire to use more <lb/>
            undisguised terms, he would not call the world, which is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible only to the intellect, any thing else but the reason of <lb/>
            God, already occupied in the creation of the world; for neither <lb/>
            is a city, while only perceptible to the intellect, anything else <lb/>
            but the reason of the architect, who is already designing to <lb/>
            build one perceptible to the external senses, on the model of <lb/>
            that which is so only to the intellect-this is the doctrine of <lb/>
            Moses, not mine. Accordingly he, when recording the cre­ <lb/>
            ation of man, in words which follow, asserts expressly, that <lb/>
            he was made in the image of God—and if the image be a part <lb/>
            of the image, then manifestly so is the entire form, namely, <lb/>
            the whole of this world perceptible by the external senses, <lb/>
            which is a greater imitation of the divine image than the <lb/>
            human form is. It is manifest also, that the archetypal seal, <lb/>
            which we call that world which is perceptible only to the in­ <lb/>
            tellect, must itself be the archetypal model, the idea of ideas, <lb/>
            the Reason of God.</p>
          <p>VII. Moses says also; “In the beginning God created the <lb/>
            heaven and the earth:" taking the beginning to be, not as <lb/>
            some men think, that which is according to time; for before <lb/>
            the world time had no existence, but was created either <lb/>
            simultaneously with it, or after it; for since time is the inter­ <lb/>
            val of the motion of the heavens, there could not have been <lb/>
            any such thing as motion before there was anything which <lb/>
            could be moved; but it follows of necessity that it received <lb/>
            existence subsequently or simultaneously. It therefore follows <lb/>
            also of necessity, that time was created either at the same <lb/>
             <pb n="7"/>
            moment with the world, or later than it-and to venture to <lb/>
            assert that it is older than the world is absolutely inconsistent <lb/>
            with philosophy. But if the beginning spoken of by Moses <lb/>
            is not to be looked upon as spoken of according to time, then <lb/>
            it may be natural to suppose that it is the beginning accord­ <lb/>
            ing to number that is indicated ; so that, " In the beginning <lb/>
            he created," is equivalent to " first of all he created the <lb/>
            heaven ;" for it is natural in reality that that should have been <lb/>
            the first object created, being both the best of all created <lb/>
            things, and being also made of the purest substance, because <lb/>
            it was destined to be the most holy abode of the visible Gods <lb/>
            who are perceptible by the external senses; for if the Creator <lb/>
            had made everything at the same moment, still those things <lb/>
            which were created in beauty would no less have had a regular <lb/>
            arrangement, for there is no such thing as beauty in disorder. <lb/>
            But order is a due consequence and connection of things pre­ <lb/>
            cedent and subsequent, if not in the completion of a work, at <lb/>
            all events in the intention of the maker; for it is owing to <lb/>
            order that they become accurately defined and stationary, and <lb/>
            free from confusion.</p>
          <p>In the first place therefore, from the model of the world, <lb/>
            perceptible only by intellect, the Creator made an incorporeal <lb/>
            heaven, and an invisible earth, and the form of air and of <lb/>
            empty space : the former of which he called darkness, because <lb/>
            the air is black by nature; and the other he called the abyss, <lb/>
            for empty space is very deep and yawning with immense <lb/>
            width. Then he created the incorporeal substance of water <lb/>
            and of air, and above all he spread light, being the seventh <lb/>
            thing made; and this again was incorporeal, and a model of <lb/>
            the sun, perceptible only to intellect, and of all the light- <lb/>
            giving stars, which are destined to stand together in heaven.</p>
          <p>VIII. And air and light he considered worthy of the pre- <lb/>
            eminence. For the one he called the breath of God, because <lb/>
            it is air, which is the most life-giving of things, and of life the <lb/>
            causer is God; and the other he called light, because it is sur­ <lb/>
            passingly beautiful: for that which is perceptible only by <lb/>
            intellect is as far more brilliant and splendid than that which <lb/>
            is seen, as I conceive, the sun is than darkness, or day than <lb/>
            night, or the intellect than any other of the outward senses by <lb/>
            which men judge (inasmuch as it is the guide of the entire <lb/>
            soul), or the eyes than any other part of the body. And the <lb/>
             <pb n="8"/>
            invisible divine reason, perceptible only by intellect, he calls <lb/>
            the image of God. And the image of this image is that light, <lb/>
            perceptible only by the intellect, which is the image of the <lb/>
            divine reason, which has explained its generation. And it is <lb/>
            a star above the heavens, the source of those stars which are <lb/>
            perceptible by the external senses, and if any one were to call <lb/>
            it universal light he would not be very wrong; since it is from <lb/>
            that the sun and the moon, and all the other planets and fixed <lb/>
            stars derive their due light, in proportion as each has power <lb/>
            given to it; that unmingled and pure light being obscured <lb/>
            when it begins to change, according to the change from that <lb/>
            which is perceptible only by the intellect, to that which is <lb/>
            perceptible by the external senses; for none of those things <lb/>
            which are perceptible to the external senses is pure.</p>
          <p>IX. Moses is right also when he says, that " darkness was <lb/>
            over the face of the abyss." For the air is in a manner <lb/>
            spread above the empty space, since having mounted up it <lb/>
            entirely fills all that open, and desolate, and empty place, <lb/>
            which reaches down to us from the regions below the moon. <lb/>
            And after the shining forth of that light, perceptible only to <lb/>
            the intellect, which existed before the sun, then its adversary <lb/>
            darkness yielded, as God put a wall between them and sepa­ <lb/>
            rated them, well knowing their opposite characters, and the <lb/>
            enmity existing between their natures. In order, therefore, <lb/>
            that they might not war against one another from being con­ <lb/>
            tinually brought in contact, so that war would prevail instead <lb/>
            of peace, God, turning want of order into order, did not only <lb/>
            separate light and darkness, but did also place boundaries in <lb/>
            the middle of the space between the two, by which he sepa­ <lb/>
            rated the extremities of each. For if they had approximated <lb/>
            they must have produced confusion, preparing for the contest, <lb/>
            for the supremacy, with great and unextinguishable rivalry, if <lb/>
            boundaries established between them had not separated them <lb/>
            and prevented them from clashing together, and these boun­ <lb/>
            daries are evening and morning; the one of which heralds in <lb/>
            the good tidings that the sun is about to rise, gently dissi­ <lb/>
            pating the darkness: and evening comes on as the sun sets, <lb/>
            receiving gently the collective approach of darkness. And <lb/>
            these, I mean morning and evening, must be placed in the <lb/>
            class of incorporeal things, perceptible only by the intellect; <lb/>
            for there is absolutely nothing in them which is perceptible by <lb/>
             <pb n="9"/>
            the external senses, but they are entirely ideas, and measures, <lb/>
            and forms, and seals, incorporeal as far as regards the genera­ <lb/>
            tion of other bodies. But when light came, and darkness <lb/>
            retreated and yielded to it, and boundaries were set in the <lb/>
            space between the two, namely, evening and morning, then of <lb/>
            necessity the measure of time was immediately perfected, <lb/>
            which also the Creator called " day," and He called it not <lb/>
            " the first day," but " one day;" and it is spoken of thus, on <lb/>
            account of the single nature of the world perceptible only by <lb/>
            the intellect, which has a single nature.</p>
          <p>X. The incorporeal world then was already completed, <lb/>
            having its seat in the Divine Reason ; and the world, percep­ <lb/>
            tible by the external senses, was made on the model of it; <lb/>
            and the first portion of it, being also the most excellent of all <lb/>
            made by the Creator, was the heaven, which he truly called <lb/>
            the firmament, as being corporeal; for the body is by nature <lb/>
            firm, inasmuch as it is divisible into three parts ; and what <lb/>
            other idea of solidity and of body can there be, except that it <lb/>
            is something which may be measured in every direction ? <lb/>
            therefore he, very naturally contrasting that which was per­ <lb/>
            ceptible to the external senses, and corporeal with that which <lb/>
            was perceptible only by the intellect and incorporeal, called <lb/>
            this the firmament. Immediately afterwards he, with great <lb/>
            propriety and entire correctness, called it the heaven, either <lb/>
            because it was already the boundary* of everything, or because <lb/>
            it was the first of all visible things which was created; and <lb/>
            after its second rising he called the time day, referring the <lb/>
            entire space and measure of a day to the heaven, on account <lb/>
            of its dignity and honour among the things perceptible to the <lb/>
            external senses.</p>
          <p>XI. And after this, as the whole body of water in existence <lb/>
            was spread over all the earth, and had penetrated through all <lb/>
            its parts, as if it were a sponge which had imbibed moisture, <lb/>
            so that the earth was only swampy land and deep mud, both <lb/>
            the elements of earth and water being mixed up and combined <lb/>
            together, like one confused mass into one undistinguishable <lb/>
            and shapeless nature, God ordained that all the water which <lb/>
            was salt, and destined to be a cause of barrenness to seeds <lb/>
            and trees should be gathered together, flowing forth out of all <note type="footnote"> * Philo means that <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐρανος</foreign> was derived either from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅροο</foreign>r, a <lb/>

            the holes of the entire earth; and he commanded dry land to <lb/>
            appear, that liquid which had any sweetness in it being left in <lb/>
            it to secure its durability. For this sweet liquid, in due pro­ <lb/>
            portions, is as a sort of glue for the different substances, <lb/>
            preventing the earth from being utterly dried up, and so <lb/>
            becoming unproductive and barren, and causing it, like a <lb/>
            mother, to furnish not only one kind of nourishment, namely <lb/>
            meat, but both sorts at once, so as to supply its offspring <lb/>
            with both meat and drink; wherefore he filled it with veins, <lb/>
            resembling breasts, which, being provided with openings, <lb/>
            were destined to pour forth springs and rivers. And in the <lb/>
            same way he extended the invisible irrigations of dew per­ <lb/>
            vading every portion of arable and deep-soiled land, to con­ <lb/>
            tribute to the most liberal and plenteous supply of fruits. <lb/>
            Having arranged these things, he gave them names, calling <lb/>
            the dry, " land," and the water which was separated from it <lb/>
            he called " sea."</p>
          <p>XII. After this he began to adorn the land, for he bade it <lb/>
            bring forth grass, and bear corn, producing every kind of <lb/>
            herb, and plains clothed with verdure, and everything which <lb/>
            was calculated to be fodder for cattle, or food for men. More­ <lb/>
            over he commanded every kind of tree to spring up, omitting <lb/>
            no kind, either of those which are wild or of those which are <lb/>
            called cultivated. And simultaneously with their first produc­ <lb/>
            tion he loaded them all with fruit, in a manner different from <lb/>
            that which exists at present; for now the different fruits are <lb/>
            produced in turn, at different seasons, and not all together <lb/>
            at one time; for who is there who does not know that first of <lb/>
            all comes the sowing and the planting; and, in the second <lb/>
            place, the growth of what has been sown and planted, in some <lb/>
            cases the plants extending their roots downwards like founda­ <lb/>
            tions, and in others raising themselves upwards to a height <lb/>
            and displaying long stalks ? After that come the buds, and <lb/>
            the putting forth of leaves, and then after everything else <lb/>
            comes the production of fruit. And again, the fruit when first <lb/>
            produced is not perfect, but it contains in itself all kinds of <lb/>
            change, with reference both to its quantity in regard of mag­ <lb/>
            nitude, and to its qualities in its multiform appearance: for <lb/>
            the fruit is produced at first like indivisible grains, which are <lb/>
            hardly visible from their diminutive size, and which one <lb/>
            might correctly enough pronounce to be the first things per­ <lb/>
             <pb n="11"/>
            ceptible by the external senses; and afterwards by little and <lb/>
            little, from the nourishment conveyed in channels, which <lb/>
            -waters the tree, and from the wholesome effect of the breezes, <lb/>
            which blow air at the same time cold and gentle, the fruit is <lb/>
            gradually vivified, and nursed up, and increased, advancing <lb/>
            onward to its perfect size ; and with its change of magnitude <lb/>
            it changes also its qualities, as if it were diversified with <lb/>
            varying colours by pictorial science.</p>
          <p>XIII. But in the first creation of the universe, as I have <lb/>
            said already, God produced the whole race of trees out of the <lb/>
            earth in full perfection, having their fruit not incomplete but <lb/>
            in a state of entire ripeness, to be ready for the immediate and <lb/>
            undelayed use and enjoyment of the animals which were about <lb/>
            immediately to be born. Accordingly he commanded the <lb/>
            earth to produce these things. And the earth, as though it <lb/>
            had for a long time been pregnant and travailing, produced <lb/>
            every sort of seed, and every sort of tree, and also of fruit, in <lb/>
            unspeakable abundance; and not only were these produced <lb/>
            fruits to be food for living animals, but enough also to serve as <lb/>
            a preparation for the continuous production of similar fruits <lb/>
            hereafter; covering substances consisting of seed, in which are <lb/>
            the principles of all plants undistinguishable and invisible, <lb/>
            but destined hereafter to become manifest and visible in the <lb/>
            periodical maturity of the fruit. For God thought fit to <lb/>
            endue nature with a long duration, making the races that he <lb/>
            was creating immortal, and giving them a participation in <lb/>
            eternity. On which account he led on and hastened the <lb/>
            beginning towards the end, and caused the end to turn back­ <lb/>
            wards to the beginning: for from plants comes fruit, as the end <lb/>
            might come from the beginning; and from the fruit comes the <lb/>
            seed, which again contains the plant within itself, so that a <lb/>
            fresh beginning may come from the end.</p>
          <p>XIV. And on the fourth day, after he had embellished the <lb/>
            earth, he diversified and adorned the heaven: not giving the <lb/>
            precedence to the inferior nature by arranging the heaven <lb/>
            subsequently to the earth, or thinking that which was the <lb/>
            more excellent and the more divine worthy only of the second <lb/>
            place, but acting thus for the more manifest demonstration of <lb/>
            the power of his dominion. For he foreknew with respect <lb/>
            to men who were not yet born, what sort of beings they would <lb/>
            be as to their opinions, forming conjectures on what was <lb/>
             <pb n="12"/>
            likely and probable, of which the greater part would be reason­ <lb/>
            able, though falling short of the character of unadulterated <lb/>
            truth; and trusting rather to visible phenomena than to God, <lb/>
            and admiring sophistry rather than wisdom. And again he <lb/>
            knew that surveying the periods of the sun and moon, to <lb/>
            which are owing the summers and winters, and the alternations <lb/>
            of spring and autumn, they would conceive the revolutions of <lb/>
            the stars in heaven to be the causes of all the things which <lb/>
            every year should be produced and generated on the earth, <lb/>
            accordingly that no one might venture either through shame­ <lb/>
            less impudence or inordinate ignorance to attribute to any <lb/>
            created thing the primary causes of things, he said: "Let <lb/>
            them run over in their minds the first creation of the universe, <lb/>
            when, before the sun or the moon existed, the earth brought <lb/>
            forth all kinds of plants and all kinds of fruits: and seeing <lb/>
            this in their minds let them hope that it will again also bring <lb/>
            forth such, according to the appointment of the Father, when <lb/>
            it shall seem good to him, without his having need of the aid <lb/>
            of any of the sons of men beneath the heavens, to whom he <lb/>
            has given powers, though not absolute ones." For as a chario <lb/>
            teer holding the reins, or a helmsman with his hand upon the <lb/>
            rudder, he guides everything as he pleases, in accordance with <lb/>
            law and justice, needing no one else as his assistant; for all <lb/>
            things are possible to God.</p>
          <p>XV. This is the cause why the earth bore fruit and herbs <lb/>
            before God proceeded to adorn the heaven. And next the <lb/>
            heaven was embellished in the perfect number four, and if <lb/>
            any one were to pronounce this number the origin and source <lb/>
            of the all-perfect decade he would not err. For what the <lb/>
            decade is in actuality, that the number four, as it seeems, is in <lb/>
            potentiality, at all events if the numerals from the unit to four* <lb/>
            are placed together in order, they will make ten, which is the <lb/>
            limit of the number of immensity, around which the numbers <lb/>
            wheel and turn as around a goal.</p>
          <p>Moreover the number four also comprehends the principles <lb/>
            of the harmonious concords in music, that in fours, and in <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_53_fig1.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="13"/>
              fifths,<note>By addition, that is: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.</note> and the diapason, and besides this the double diapason <lb/>
              from which sounds the most perfect system of harmony is pro­ <lb/>
              duced. For the ratio of the sounds in fourths is as four to <lb/>
              three ; and in fifths as three to two ; and in the diapason that ratio <lb/>
              is doubled : and in the double diapason it is increased fourfold, <lb/>
              all which ratios the number four comprehends. At all <lb/>
              events the first, or the epistritus, is the ratio of four to three; <lb/>
              the second, or the hemiolius, is that of three to two : the two­ <lb/>
              fold ratio is that of two to one, or four to two : and the four­ <lb/>
              fold ratio is that of four to one.</p>
          <p>XVI. There is also another power of the number four which <lb/>
            is a most wonderful one to speak of and to contemplate. For <lb/>
            it was this number that first displayed the nature of the solid <lb/>
            cube, the numbers before four being assigned only to incorpo­ <lb/>
            real things. For it is according to the unit that that thing <lb/>
            is reckoned which is spoken of in geometry as a point: and a <lb/>
            line is spoken of according to the number two, because it is <lb/>
            arranged by nature from a point; and a line is length without <lb/>
            breadth. But when breadth is added to it, it becomes a <lb/>
            superficies, which is arranged according to the number three. <lb/>
            And a superficies, when compared with the nature of a solid <lb/>
            cube, wants one thing, namely depth, and when this one thing <lb/>
            is added to the three, it becomes four. On which account it <lb/>
            has happened that this number is a thing of great importance, <lb/>
            inasmuch as from an incorporeal substance perceptible only <lb/>
            by intellect, it has led us on to a comprehension of a body <lb/>
            divisible in a threefold manner, and which by its own nature <lb/>
            is first perceived by the external senses. And he who does <lb/>
            not comprehend what is here said may learn to understand it <lb/>
            from a game which is very common. Those who play with <lb/>
            nuts are accustomed when they have placed three nuts on the <lb/>
            floor, to place one more on the top of them producing a figure <lb/>
            like a pyramid. Accordingly the triangle stands on the floor, <lb/>
            arranged up to the number three, and the nut which is placed <lb/>
            upon it makes up four in number, and in figure it produces a <lb/>
            pyramid, being now a solid body.</p>
          <p>And in addition to this there is this point also of which we <lb/>
            should not be ignorant, the number four is the first number <lb/>
            which is a square, being equal on all sides, the measure of <lb/>
            justice and equality. And that it is the only number the <lb/>
            nature of which is such that it is produced by the same numbers <lb/>
             <pb n="14"/>
            whether in combination, or in power. In combination when <lb/>
            two and two are added together ; and again in power when we <lb/>
            speak of twice two ;* and in this it displays an exceedingly <lb/>
            beautiful kind of harmony, which is not the lot of any other <lb/>
            number.</p>
          <p>If we examine the number six which is composed of two <lb/>
            threes, if these two numbers are multiplied it is not the number <lb/>
            six that is produced, but a different one, the number nine. <lb/>
            And the number four has many other powers also, which we <lb/>
            must subsequently show more accurately in a separate essay <lb/>
            appropriated to it. At present it is sufficient to add this that <lb/>
            it was the foundation of the creation of the whole heaven and <lb/>
            the whole world. For the four elements, out of which this <lb/>
            universe was made, flowed from the number four as from a <lb/>
            fountain. And in addition to the four elements the seasons of <lb/>
            the year are also four, which are the causes of the generation <lb/>
            of animals and plants, the year being divided into the quadruple <lb/>
            division of winter, and spring, and summer, and autumn.</p>
          <p>XVII. The aforesaid number therefore being accounted <lb/>
            worthy of such pre eminence in nature, the Creator of necessity <lb/>
            adorned the heaven by the number four, namely by that most <lb/>
            beautiful and most godlike ornament the light-giving stars. And <lb/>
            knowing that of all existing things light is the most excellent, <lb/>
            he made it the instrument of the best of all the senses, sight. <lb/>
            For what the mind is in the soul, that the eye is in the body. <lb/>
            For each of them sees, the one beholding those existing things <lb/>
            which are perceptible only to the intellect, and the other those <lb/>
            which are perceptible to the external senses.</p>
          <p>But the mind is in need of knowledge in order to distinguish <lb/>
            incorporeal things, and the eyes have need of light in order to <lb/>
            be able to perceive bodies, and light is also the cause of many <lb/>
            other good things to men, and particularly of the greatest, <lb/>
            namely philosophy. For the sight being sent upwards by light <lb/>
            and beholding the nature of the stars and their harmonious <lb/>
            movement, and the well-ordered-revolutions of the fixed stars, <lb/>
            and of the planets, some always revolving in the same manner <lb/>
            and coming to the same places, and others having double <lb/>
            periods in an anomalous and somewhat contrary manner, be­ <lb/>
            holding also, the harmonious dances of all these bodies arranged <lb/>
            according to the laws of perfect music, causes an ineffable <note>Thus, 2+2 = 4, or 2 * 2 = 4.</note> <figure type="illustration">
              <graphic url="ENG_BELL_53_fig2.jpg"/></figure> <lb/>
               <pb n="15"/>
              joy and delight to the soul. And the soul, feasting on a <lb/>
              continuous series of spectacles, for one succeeds another, has an <lb/>
              insatiable love for beholding such. Then, as is usually the <lb/>
              ease, it examines with increased curiosity what is the substance <lb/>
              of these things which are visible ; and whether they have an <lb/>
              existence without having been created, or whether they received <lb/>
              their origin by creation, and what is the character of their <lb/>
              movement, and what the causes are by which everything is <lb/>
              regulated. And it is from inquiries into these things that <lb/>
              philosophy has arisen, than which no more perfect good has <lb/>
              entered into human life.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But the Creator having a regard to that idea of light <lb/>
            perceptible only by the intellect, which has been spoken of in <lb/>
            the mention made of the incorporeal world, created those stars <lb/>
            which are perceptible by the external senses, those divine and <lb/>
            superlatively beautiful images, which on many accounts he <lb/>
            placed in the purest temple of corporeal substance, namely in <lb/>
            heaven. One of the reasons for his so doing was that they <lb/>
            might give light; another was that they might be signs; <lb/>
            another had reference to their dividing the times of the sea­ <lb/>
            sons of the year, and above all dividing days and nights, <lb/>
            months and years, which are the measures of time ; and which <lb/>
            have given rise to the nature of number. And how great is <lb/>
            the use and how great the advantage derivable from each of <lb/>
            the aforesaid things, is plain from their effect. But with a <lb/>
            view to a more accurate comprehension of them, it may <lb/>
            perhaps not be out of place to trace out the truth in a regular <lb/>
            discussion.</p>
          <p>Now the whole of time being divided into two portions day <lb/>
            and night, the sovereignty of the day the Father has assigned <lb/>
            to the Sun, as a mighty monarch : and that of the night he <lb/>
            has given to the moon and to the multitude of the other stars. <lb/>
            And the greatness of the power and sovereignty of the sun <lb/>
            has its most conspicuous proof in what has been already said : <lb/>
            for he, being one and single has been allotted for his own <lb/>
            share and by himself one half portion of all time, namely day; <lb/>
            and all the other lights in conjunction with the moon have <lb/>
            the other portion, which is called night. And when the sun <lb/>
            rises all the appearances of such numbers of stars are not only <lb/>
            obscured but absolutely disappear from the effusion of his <lb/>
            beams; and when he sets then they all assembled together, <lb/>
             <pb n="16"/>
            begin to display their own peculiar brilliancy and their sepa­ <lb/>
            rate qualities,</p>
          <p>XIX. And they have been created, as Moses tells us, not <lb/>
            only that they might send light upon the earth, but also that <lb/>
            they might display signs of future events. For either by their <lb/>
            risings, or their settings, or their eclipses, or again by their <lb/>
            appearances and occupations, or by the other variations observ­ <lb/>
            able in their motions, men oftentimes conjecture what is about <lb/>
            to happen, the productiveness or unproductiveness of the crops, <lb/>
            the birth or loss of their cattle, fine weather or cloudy weather, <lb/>
            calms and violent storms of wind, floods in the rivers or <lb/>
            droughts, a tranquil state of the sea and heavy waves, unusual <lb/>
            changes in the seasons of the year when either the summer is cold <lb/>
            like winter, or the winter warm, or when the spring assumes <lb/>
            the temperature of autumn or the autumn that of spring. And <lb/>
            before now some men have conjecturally predicted disturban­ <lb/>
            ces and commotions of the earth from the revolutions of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies, and innumerable other events which have <lb/>
            turned out most exactly true: so that it is a most veracious <lb/>
            saying that " the stars were created to act as signs, and <lb/>
            moreover to mark the seasons." And by the word seasons the <lb/>
            divisions of the year are here intended. And why may not <lb/>
            this be reasonably affirmed ? For what other idea of opportunity <lb/>
            can there be except that it is the time for success ? And the <lb/>
            seasons bring everything to perfection and set everything <lb/>
            right; giving perfection to the sowing and planting of fruits, <lb/>
            and to the birth and growth of animals.</p>
          <p>They were also created to serve as measures of time; for it <lb/>
            is by the appointed periodical revolutions of the sun and moon <lb/>
            and other stars, that days and months and years are deter­ <lb/>
            mined. And moreover it is owing to them that the most <lb/>
            useful of all things, the nature of number exists, time having <lb/>
            displayed it; for from one day comes the limit, and from two <lb/>
            the number two, and from three, three, and from the notion <lb/>
            of a month is derived the number thirty, and from a year that <lb/>
            number which is equal to the days of the twelve months, and <lb/>
            from infinite time comes the notion of infinite number.</p>
          <p>To such great and indispensable advantages do the natures <lb/>
            of the heavenly bodies and the motions of the stars tend. <lb/>
            And to how many other things might I also affirm that they <lb/>
            contribute which are as yet unknown to us? for all things are <lb/>
             <pb n="17"/>
            not known to the will of man ; but of the things which con­ <lb/>
            tribute towards the durability of the universe, those which are <lb/>
            established by laws and ordinances which God has appointed <lb/>
            to be unalterable for ever, are accomplished in every instance <lb/>
            and in every country.</p>
          <p>XX. Then when earth and heaven had been adorned with <lb/>
            their befitting ornaments, one with a triad, and the other, as has <lb/>
            been already said, with a quaternion, God proceeded to <unclear>create</unclear> the <lb/>
            races of mortal creatures, making the beginning with the <lb/>
            aquatic animals on the fifth day, thinking that there was no <lb/>
            one thing so akin to another as the number five was to ani­ <lb/>
            mals ; for animate things differ from inanimate in nothing <lb/>
            more than in sensation, and sensation is divided according to <lb/>
            a five-fold division, into sight, hearing, taste, smell, and <lb/>
            touch. Accordingly, the Creator allotted to each of the senses <lb/>
            its appropriate matter, and also its peculiar faculty of judg­ <lb/>
            ment, by which it should decide on what came before it. So <lb/>
            sight judges of colours, and hearing of sounds, and taste of <lb/>
            juices, and smell of vapours, and touch of softness and hard­ <lb/>
            ness, and of heat and cold, and of smoothness and roughness : <lb/>
            therefore He commanded all the races of fish and sea-monsters <lb/>
            to stand together in their places, animals differing both in <lb/>
            their sizes and in their qualities; for they vary in different <lb/>
            seas, though in some cases they are the same, and every <lb/>
            animal was not formed to live every where. And was not this <lb/>
            reasonable? For some of them delight in marshy places, <lb/>
            and in water which is very deep; and some in sewers and <lb/>
            harbours, being neither able to crawl up upon the land, nor to <lb/>
            swim off far from the land. Some, again, dwell in the middle <lb/>
            and in the deep sea, and avoid all the projecting promontories <lb/>
            and islands and rocks : some also exult in fine weather and <lb/>
            in calms, and some in storms and heavy surf. For being <lb/>
            exercised by continual buffetings, and being in the habit of <lb/>
            withstanding the current by force, they are very vigorous and <lb/>
            become stout.</p>
          <p>After that he created the races of birds as akin to the races <lb/>
            of aquatic animals (for they are each of them swimmers), <lb/>
            leaving no species of creatures which traverse the air un­ <lb/>
            finished.</p>
          <p>XXI. So now when the air and the water had received <lb/>
            their appropriate races of animals as an allotment that was <note type="footnote"> c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="18"/>
            their due, God again summoned the earth for the creation of <lb/>
            that share which still remained : and after the production of <lb/>
            plants, the terrestrial animals still remained. And God <lb/>
            said, " Let the earth bring forth cattle and beasts, and creep­ <lb/>
            ing things of each kind." And the earth did as it was com­ <lb/>
            manded, and immediately sent forth animals differing in their <lb/>
            formation and in their strength, and in the injurious or <lb/>
            beneficial powers that were implanted in them.</p>
          <p>And after all He made man. But how he made him I will <lb/>
            mention presently, after I have first explained that he adopted <lb/>
            the most beautiful connection and train of consequences <lb/>
            according to the system of the creation of animals which he had <lb/>
            sketched out to himself; for of souls the most sluggish and <lb/>
            the most weakly formed has been allotted to the race of fishes; <lb/>
            and the most exquisitely endowed soul, that which is in all <lb/>
            respects most excellent, has been given to the race of man­ <lb/>
            kind, and one something between the two to the races of ter­ <lb/>
            restrial animals and those which traverse the air; for the soul <lb/>
            of such creatures is endowed with more acute sensations than <lb/>
            the soul of fishes, but is more dull than that of mankind. <lb/>
            And it was on this account that of all living creatures God <lb/>
            created fishes first, inasmuch as they partake of corporeal <lb/>
            substance in a greater degree than they partake of soul, being <lb/>
            in a manner animals and not animals, moving soulless things, <lb/>
            having a sort of semblance of soul diffused through them for no <lb/>
            object beyond that of keeping their bodies alive (just as they <lb/>
            say that salt preserves meat), in order that they may not <lb/>
            easily be destroyed. And after the fishes, he created winged <lb/>
            and terrestrial animals: -for these are endowed with a <lb/>
            higher degree of sensation, and from their formation show <lb/>
            that the properties of their animating principle are of a higher <lb/>
            order. But after all the rest, then, as has been said before, <lb/>
            he created man, to whom he gave that admirable endowment <lb/>
            of mind-the soul, if I may so call it, of the soul, as being <lb/>
            like the pupil to the eye ; for those who most accurately inves­ <lb/>
            tigate the natures of things affirm, that it is the pupil which <lb/>
            is the eye of the eye.</p>
          <p>XXII. So at last all things were created and existing <lb/>
            together. But when they all were collected in one place, then <lb/>
            some sort of order was necessarily laid down for them for the <lb/>
            sake of the production of them from one another which was <lb/>
             <pb n="19"/>
            hereafter to take place. Now in things which exist in part, <lb/>
            the principle of order is this, to begin with that which is most <lb/>
            inferior in its nature, and to end with that which is the most <lb/>
            excellent of all; and what that is we will explain. It has been <lb/>
            arranged that seed should be the principle of the generation of <lb/>
            animals. It is plainly seen that this is a thing of no import­ <lb/>
            ance, being like foam; but when it has descended into the <lb/>
            womb and remained there, then immediately it receives <lb/>
            motion and is changed into nature ; and nature is more excel­ <lb/>
            lent than seed, as also motion is better than quiet in created <lb/>
            things; and nature, like a workman, or, to speak more cor­ <lb/>
            rectly, like a faultless art, endows the moist substance with <lb/>
            life, and fashions it, distributing it among the limbs and parts <lb/>
            of the body, allotting that portion which can produce breath, <lb/>
            and nourishment, and sensation to the powers of the soul: for <lb/>
            as to the reasoning powers, we may pass over them for the <lb/>
            present, on account of those who say, that the mind enters <lb/>
            into the body from without, being something divine and <lb/>
            eternal.</p>
          <p>Nature therefore began from an insignificant seed, and <lb/>
            ended in the most honourable of things, namely, in the for­ <lb/>
            mation of animals and men. And the very same thing took <lb/>
            place in the creation of every thing: for when the Creator <lb/>
            determined to make animals the first created in his arrange­ <lb/>
            ment were in some degree inferior, such as the fishes, and the <lb/>
            last were the best, namely, man. And the others the ter­ <lb/>
            restrial and winged creatures were between these extremes, <lb/>
            being better than the first created, and inferior to the last.</p>
          <p>XXIII. So then after all the other things, as has been­ <lb/>
            said before, Moses says that man was made in the image and <lb/>
            likeness of God. And he says well; for nothing that is born on <lb/>
            the earth is more resembling God than man. And let no one <lb/>
            think that he is able to judge of this likeness from the charac­ <lb/>
            ters of the body : for neither is God a being with the form of a <lb/>
            man, nor is the human body like the form of God; but the <lb/>
            resemblance is spoken of with reference to the most important <lb/>
            part of the soul, namely, the mind: for the mind which <lb/>
            exists in each individual has been created after the likeness <lb/>
            of that one mind which is in the universe as its primitive <lb/>
            model, being in some sort the God of that body which carries <lb/>
            it about and bears its image within it. In the same rank <note type="footnote"> c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="20"/>
            that the great Governor occupies in the universal world, that <lb/>
            same as it seems does the mind of man occupy in man; for it <lb/>
            is invisible, though it sees everything itself; and it has an <lb/>
            essence which is undiscernible, though it can discern the <lb/>
            essences of all other things, and making for itself by art <lb/>
            and science all sorts of roads leading in divers directions, <lb/>
            and all plain; it traverses land and sea, investigating every­ <lb/>
            thing which is contained in either element. And again, being <lb/>
            raised up on wings, and so surveying and contemplating the <lb/>
            air, and all the commotions to which it is subject, it is borne <lb/>
            upwards to the higher firmament, and to the revolutions of the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies. And also being itself involved in the revo­ <lb/>
            lutions of the planets and fixed stars according to the perfect <lb/>
            laws of music, and being led on by love, which is the guide <unclear>or</unclear> <lb/>
            wisdom, it proceeds onwards till, having surmounted all <lb/>
            essence intelligible by the external senses, it comes to aspire <lb/>
            to such as is perceptible only by the intellect: and perceiving <lb/>
            in that, the original models and ideas of those things intelli­ <lb/>
            ble by the external senses which it saw here full of surpassing <lb/>
            beauty, it becomes seized with a sort of sober intoxication like <lb/>
            the zealots engaged in the Corybantian festivals, and yields <lb/>
            to enthusiasm, becoming filled with another desire, and a <lb/>
            more excellent longing, by which it is conducted onwards to <lb/>
            the very summit of such things as are perceptible only to the <lb/>
            intellect, till it appears to be reaching the great King himself. <lb/>
            And while it is eagerly longing to behold him pure and unmingled, <lb/>
            rays of divine light are poured forth upon it like a torrent, so <lb/>
            as to bewilder the eyes of its intelligence by their splendour.</p>
          <p>But as it is not every image that resembles its archetypal <lb/>
            model, since many are unlike, Moses has shown this by <lb/>
            adding to the words " after his image," the expression, “in <lb/>
            his likeness," to prove that it means an accurate impression, <lb/>
            having a clear and evident resemblance in form.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And he would not err who should raise the ques­ <lb/>
            tion why Moses attributed the creation of man alone not to one <lb/>
            creator, as he did that of other animals, but to several. For he <lb/>
            introduces the Father of the universe using this language: <lb/>
            Let us make man after our image, and in our likeness." <lb/>
            Had he then, shall I say, need of any one whatever to help him, <lb/>
            He to whom all things are subject? Or, when he was making <lb/>
            the heaven and the earth and the sea, was he in need of no <lb/>
             <pb n="21"/>
            one to co-operate with him ; and yet was he unable himself <lb/>
            by his own power to make man an animal so short-lived and <lb/>
            so exposed to the assaults of fate without the assistance of <lb/>
            others? It is plain that the real cause of his so acting is <lb/>
            known to God alone, but one which to a reasonable conjecture <lb/>
            appears probable and credible, I think I should not conceal; <lb/>
            and it is this.</p>
          <p>Of existing things, there are some which partake neither of <lb/>
            virtue nor of vice; as for instance, plants and irrational ani­ <lb/>
            mals ; the one, because they are destitute of soul, and are <lb/>
            regulated by a nature void of sense; and the other, because <lb/>
            they are not endowed with mind or reason. But mind and <lb/>
            reason may be looked upon as the abode of virtue and vice ; as it <lb/>
            is in them that they seem to dwell. Some things again partake <lb/>
            of virtue alone, being without any participation in any kind of <lb/>
            vice ; as for instance, the stars, for they are said to be animals, <lb/>
            and animals endowed with intelligence ; or I might rather say, <lb/>
            the mind of each of them is wholly and entirely virtuous, and <lb/>
            unsusceptible of every kind of evil. Some things again are of <lb/>
            a mixed nature, like man, who is capable of opposite qualities, <lb/>
            of wisdom and folly, of temperance and dissoluteness, of cou­ <lb/>
            rage and cowardice, of justice and injustice, in short of good and <lb/>
            evil, of what is honourable and what is disgraceful, of virtue and <lb/>
            vice. Now it was a very appropriate task for God the Father <lb/>
            of all to create by himself alone, those things which were wholly <lb/>
            good, on account of their kindred with himself. And it <lb/>
            was not inconsistent with his dignity to create those which <lb/>
            were indifferent since they too are devoid of evil, which is <lb/>
            hateful to him. To create the beings of a mixed nature, was <lb/>
            partly consistent and partly inconsistent with his dignity ; <lb/>
            consistent by reason of the more excellent idea which is <lb/>
            mingled in them; inconsistent because of the opposite and <lb/>
            worse one.</p>
          <p>It is on this account that Moses says, at the creation of man <lb/>
            alone that God said, “Let us make man," which expression <lb/>
            shows an assumption of other beings to himself as assistants. <lb/>
            in order that God, the governor of all things, might have all the <lb/>
            blameless intentions and actions of man, when he does right <lb/>
            attributed to him; and that his other assistants might bear <lb/>
            the imputation of his contrary actions. For it was fitting that <lb/>
            the Father should in the eyes of his children be free from all <lb/>
             <pb n="22"/>
            imputation of evil; and vice and energy in accordance with <lb/>
            vice arc evil. And very beautifully after he had called the <lb/>
            whole race “man," did he distinguish between the sexes, <lb/>
            saying, that “ they were created male and female ;" although all <lb/>
            the individuals of the race had not yet assumed their distinc­ <lb/>
            tive form; since the extreme species are contained in the <lb/>
            genus, and are beheld, as in a mirror, by those who are able <lb/>
            to discern acutely.</p>
          <p>XXV. And some one may inquire the cause why it was <lb/>
            that man was the last work in the creation of the world. <lb/>
            For the Creator and Father created him after every thing else <lb/>
            as the sacred scriptures inform us. Accordingly, they who <lb/>
            have gone most deeply into the laws, and who to the best of <lb/>
            their power have investigated everything that is contained in <lb/>
            them with all diligence, say that God, when he had given to <lb/>
            man to partake of kindred with himself, grudged him neither <lb/>
            reason, which is the most excellent of all gifts, nor anything else <lb/>
            that is good; but before his creation, provided for him every <lb/>
            thing in the world, as for the animal most resembling himself, <lb/>
            and dearest to him, being desirous that when he was born, he <lb/>
            should be in want of nothing requisite for living, and for living <lb/>
            well; the first of which objects is provided for by the abun­ <lb/>
            dance of supplies which are furnished to him for his enjoyment, <lb/>
            and the other by his power of contemplation of the heavenly <lb/>
            bodies, by which the mind is smitten so as to conceive a love <lb/>
            and desire for knowledge on those subjects ; owing to which <lb/>
            desire, philosophy has sprung up, by which, man, though <lb/>
            mortal, is made immortal. As then, those who make a feast <lb/>
            do not invite their guests to the entertainment before they have <lb/>
            provided everything for festivity, and as those who celebrate <lb/>
            gymnastic or dramatic contests, before they assemble the specta­ <lb/>
            tors, provide themselves with an abundance of competitors and <lb/>
            spectacles, and sweet sounds, with which to fill the theatres <lb/>
            and the stadia; so in the same manner did the Ruler of all, <lb/>
            as a man proposing games, or giving a banquet and being <lb/>
            about to invite others to feast and to behold the spectacle, first <lb/>
            provide everything for every kind of entertainment, in order <lb/>
            that when man came into the world he might at once find a <lb/>
            feast ready for him, and a most holy theatre ; the one abound­ <lb/>
            ing with everything which the earth, or the rivers, or the sea, <lb/>
            or air, brings forth for use and enjoyment, and the other being <lb/>
             <pb n="23"/>
            full of every description of light, which has either its essence or <lb/>
            its qualities admirable, and its motions and revolutions worthy <lb/>
            of notice, being arranged in perfect order, both as to the propor­ <lb/>
            tions of its numbers, and the harmony of its periods. And a man <lb/>
            would not be far wrong who should say that in all these things <lb/>
            there might be discovered that archetypal and real model music, <lb/>
            the images of which the subsequent generations of mankind <lb/>
            engraved in their own souls, and in this way handed down <lb/>
            the art which is the most necessary and the most advantageous <lb/>
            to human life.</p>
          <p>XXVI. This is the first reason on account of which it <lb/>
            seems that man was created after all other animals. And <lb/>
            there is another not altogether unreasonable, which I must <lb/>
            mention. At the moment of his first birth, man found all <lb/>
            the requisites for life ready prepared for him that he might <lb/>
            teach them to those who should come afterwards. Nature all but <lb/>
            crying out with a distinct voice, that men, imitating the Author <lb/>
            of their being, should pass their lives without labour and with­ <lb/>
            out trouble, living in the most ungrudging abundance and <lb/>
            plenty. And this would be the case if there were neither <lb/>
            irrational pleasures to obtain mastery over the soul raising up <lb/>
            a wall of gluttony and lasciviousness, nor desires of glory, or <lb/>
            power, or riches, to assume dominion over life, nor pains to <lb/>
            contract and warp the intellect, nor that evil councillor-fear, <lb/>
            to restrain the natural inclinations towards virtuous actions, <lb/>
            nor folly and cowardice, and injustice, and the incalculable <lb/>
            multitude of other evils to attack them. But now that all the <lb/>
            evils which I have now been mentioning are vigorous, and that <lb/>
            men abandon themselves without restraint to their passions, <lb/>
            and to those unbridled and guilty inclinations, which it is im­ <lb/>
            pious even to mention, justice encounters them as a suitable <lb/>
            chastiser of wicked habits ; and therefore, as a punishment for <lb/>
            wrong doers, the necessaries of life have been made difficult of <lb/>
            acquisition. For men ploughing up the plains with difficulty, <lb/>
            and bringing streams from rivers, and fountains by channels, <lb/>
            and sowing and planting, and submitting indefatigably day and <lb/>
            night to the labour of cultivating the ground, provide them­ <lb/>
            selves every year with what is necessary, even that at times <lb/>
            being attended with pain ; and not very sufficient in quantity, <lb/>
            from being injured by many causes. For either a fall of inces­ <lb/>
            sant rain has carried away the crops, or the weight of hail which <lb/>
             <pb n="24"/>
            has fallen upon them has crushed them altogether, or snow has <lb/>
            chilled them, or the violence of the winds has torn them up by <lb/>
            the roots; for water and air cause many alterations, tending <lb/>
            to destroy the productiveness of the crops. But if the immo­ <lb/>
            derate violence of the passions were appeased by temperance, and <lb/>
            the inclination to do wrong and depraved ambition were corrected <lb/>
            by justice, and in short if the vices and unhallowed actions done <lb/>
            in accordance with them, were corrected by the virtues, and the <lb/>
            energies in accordance with them, the war of the soul being <lb/>
            terminated, which is in good truth the most grievous and heavy <lb/>
            of all wars, and peace being established, and founding amid all <lb/>
            our faculties, a due regard for law, with all tranquillity and mild­ <lb/>
            ness, then there would be hope that God, as being a friend to <lb/>
            virtue, and a friend to honour, and above all a friend to man, <lb/>
            would bestow upon the race of man, all kinds of spontaneous <lb/>
            blessings from his ready store. For it is evident that it is <lb/>
            easier to supply most abundantly the requisite supplies without <lb/>
            having recourse to agricultural means, from treasures which <lb/>
            already exist, than to bring forth what as yet has no existence.</p>
          <p>XXVII. I have now mentioned the second reason. There <lb/>
            is also a third, which is as follows :—God, intending to adapt <lb/>
            the beginning and the end of all created things together, as being <lb/>
            all necessary and dear to one another, made heaven the be­ <lb/>
            ginning, and man the end : the one being the most perfect of <lb/>
            incorruptible things, among those things which are perceptible <lb/>
            by the external senses; and the other, the best of all earth­ <lb/>
            born and perishable productions-a short-lived heaven if one <lb/>
            were to speak the truth, bearing within himself many starlike <lb/>
            natures, by means of certain arts and sciences, and illustrious <lb/>
            speculations, according to every kind of virtue. For since the <lb/>
            corruptible and the incorruptible, are by nature opposite, he has <lb/>
            allotted the best thing of each species to the beginning and <lb/>
            to the end. Heaven, as I before said, to the beginning, and <lb/>
            man to the end.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. And besides all this, another is also mentioned <lb/>
            among the necessary causes. It was necessary that man <lb/>
            should be the last of all created beings : in order that being so, <lb/>
            and appearing suddenly, he might strike terror into the other <lb/>
            animals. For it was fitting that they, as soon as they first saw <lb/>
            him should admire and worship him, as their natural ruler and <lb/>
            master ; on which account, they all, as soon as they saw him, <lb/>
             <pb n="25"/>
            became tame before him; even those, who by nature were <lb/>
            most savage, becoming at once most manageable at the first <lb/>
            sight of him; displaying their unbridled ferocity to one <lb/>
            another, and being tame to man alone. For which reason the <lb/>
            Father who made him to be a being dominant over them by na­ <lb/>
            ture not merely in fact, but also by express verbal appointment, <lb/>
            established him as the king of all the animals, beneath the <lb/>
            moon, whether terrestrial or aquatic, or such as traverse the <lb/>
            air. For every mortal thing which lives in the three elements, <lb/>
            land, water or air, did he put in subjection to him, excepting <lb/>
            only the beings that are in heaven, as creatures who have a <lb/>
            more divine portion. And what is apparent to our eyes is <lb/>
            the most evident proof of this. For at times, innumerable <lb/>
            herds of beasts are led about by one man, not armed, nor <lb/>
            wearing iron, nor any defensive weapon, but clad only in a skin <lb/>
            for a garment, and carrying a staff, for the purpose of making <lb/>
            signs, and to lean upon also in his journeys if he become weary. <lb/>
            And so the shepherd, and the goatherd, and the cowherd, lead <lb/>
            numerous flocks of sheep, and goats, and herds of oxen ; men <lb/>
            neither vigorous, nor active in their bodies, so as to strike <lb/>
            those who behold them with admiration because of their fiue <lb/>
            appearance; and all the might and power of such numerous <lb/>
            and well-armed beasts (for they have means of self-defence <lb/>
            given them by nature), yet dread them as slaves do their <lb/>
            master, and do all that is commanded them. Bulls are yoked <lb/>
            to the plough to till the ground, and cutting deep furrows all <lb/>
            day, sometimes even for a long space of time together, while <lb/>
            some farmer is managing them. And rams being weighed <lb/>
            down with heavy fleeces of wool, in the spring season, at the <lb/>
            command of the shepherd, stand quietly, and lying down, without <lb/>
            resistance, permit their wool to be shorn off, being accustomed <lb/>
            naturally, like cities, to yield a yearly tribute to their sove­ <lb/>
            reign. And moreover, that most spirited of animals, the horse, <lb/>
            is easily guided after he has been bridled; in order that he <lb/>
            may not become frisky, and shake off the rein ; and he hollows <lb/>
            his back in an admirable manner to receive his rider and to <lb/>
            afford him a good seat, and then bearing him aloft, he gallops <lb/>
            at a rapid pace, being eager to arrive at and carry him to <lb/>
            the place to which he is urging him. And the rider without <lb/>
            any toil, but in the most perfect quiet, makes a rapid journey, <lb/>
            by using the body and feet of another animal.</p><pb n="26"/>
            
          <p>XXIX. And any one who was inclined to dwell upon this <lb/>
            subject might bring forward a great many other instances, to <lb/>
            prove that there is no animal in the enjoyment of perfect liberty, <lb/>
            and exempt from the dominion of man; but what has been <lb/>
            already said is sufficient by way of example. We ought, how­ <lb/>
            ever, not to be ignorant of this also, that it is no proof because man <lb/>
            was the last created animal that he is the lowest in rank, and <lb/>
            charioteers and pilots are witnesses of this ; for the charioteers <lb/>
            sit behind their beasts of burden, and are placed at, their backs, <lb/>
            and yet when they have the reins in their hands, they guide <lb/>
            them wherever they choose, and at one time they urge them on <lb/>
            to a swift pace, and at another time they hold them back, if <lb/>
            they are going on at a speed greater than is desirable. And <lb/>
            pilots again, sitting in the hindmost part of the ship, that is <lb/>
            the stern are, as one may say, the most important of all the <lb/>
            people in the ship, inasmuch as they have the safety of the <lb/>
            ship and of all those who are in it, in their hands. And so <lb/>
            the Creator has made man to be as it were a charioteer <lb/>
            and pilot over all other animals, in order that he may <lb/>
            hold the reins and direct the course of every thing upon earth, <lb/>
            having the superintendence of all animals and plants, as a <lb/>
            sort of viceroy of the principal and mighty King.</p>
          <p>XXX. But after the whole world had been completed ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the perfect nature of the number six, the Father <lb/>
            hallowed the day following, the seventh, praising it, and calling <lb/>
            it holy. For that day is the festival, not of one city or one <lb/>
            country, but of all the earth ; a day which alone it is right to <lb/>
            call the day of festival for all people, and the birthday of the <lb/>
            world. And I know not if any one would be able to celebrate <lb/>
            the nature of the number seven in adequate terms, since it is <lb/>
            superior to every form of expression. But it does not follow <lb/>
            that because it is more admirable than anything that can be. <lb/>
            said of it, that on that account one ought to keep silence ; but <lb/>
            rather we ought to try, even if one cannot say everything which <lb/>
            is proper, or even that which is most proper, at all events to <lb/>
            utter such things as may be attainable by our capacities.</p>
          <p>The number seven is spoken of in two ways; the one within <lb/>
            the number ten which is measured by repeating the unit alone <lb/>
            seven times, and which consists of seven units; the other is <lb/>
            the number outside ten, the beginning of which is altogether <lb/>
            the unit increasing according to a twofold or threefold, or any <lb/>
             <pb n="27"/>
            other proportion whatever; as are the numbers sixty-four, <lb/>
            and seven hundred and twenty-nine ; the one number of which <lb/>
            is increased by doubling on from the unit, and the other by <lb/>
            trebling. And it is not well to examine either species super­ <lb/>
            ficially, but the second has a most manifest pre-eminence. For <lb/>
            in every case the number which is combined from the unit in <lb/>
            double or treble ratio, or any other ratio, whatsoever, is the <lb/>
            seventh number, a cube and a square, embracing both species, <lb/>
            both that of the incorporeal and that of the corporeal essence. <lb/>
            That of the incorporeal essence according to the superficies which <lb/>
            quadrangular figures present, and that of the corporeal essence <lb/>
            according to the other figure which cubes make ; and the <lb/>
            clearest proof of this is afforded by the numbers already spoken <lb/>
            of. In the seventh number increasing immediately from the <lb/>
            unit in a twofold ratio, namely, the number sixty-four, is a <lb/>
            square formed by the multiplication of eight by eight, and it is <lb/>
            also a cube, by the multiplication of four and four, four times. <lb/>
            And again, the seventh number from the unit being increased <lb/>
            in a threefold ratio, that is to say, the number seven hundred <lb/>
            and twenty-nine, is a square, the number seven and twenty <lb/>
            being multiplied by itself; and it is also a cube, by nine being <lb/>
            multiplied by itself nine times. And in every case a man <lb/>
            making his beginning from the unit, and proceeding on to the <lb/>
            seventh number, and increasing in the same ratio till he <lb/>
            comes to the number seven, will at all times find the number, <lb/>
            when increased, both a cube and a square. At all events, he <lb/>
            who begins with the number sixty-four, and combines them in <lb/>
            a doubling ratio, will make the seventh number four thousand <lb/>
            and ninety-six, which is both a square and a cube, having sixty- <lb/>
            four as its square root, and sixteen as its cube root.</p>
          <p>XXXI. And we must also pass on to the other species of <lb/>
            the number seven, which is contained in the number ten, and <lb/>
            which displays an admirable nature, and one not inferior to the <lb/>
            previously mentioned species. The number seven consists of <lb/>
            one, and two and four, numbers which have two most har­ <lb/>
            monious ratios, the twofold and the fourfold ratio; the former <lb/>
            of which affects the diapason harmony, while the fourfold ratio <lb/>
            causes that of the double diapason. It also comprehends other <lb/>
            divisions, existing in some kind of yoke-like combination. For <lb/>
            it is divided first of all into the number one, and the num­ <lb/>
            ber six; then into the two and the five; and last of all, into <lb/>
             <pb n="28"/>
            the three and the four. And the proportion of these numbers <lb/>
            is a most musical one ; for the number six bears to the num­ <lb/>
            ber one a sixfold ratio, and the sixfold ratio causes the greatest <lb/>
            possible. difference between existing tones; the distance <lb/>
            namely, by which the sharpest tone is separated from the <lb/>
            flattest, as we shall show when we pass on from numbers to <lb/>
            the discussion of harmony. Again, the ratio of four to two <lb/>
            displays the greatest power in harmony, almost equal to that <lb/>
            of the diapason, as is most evidently shown in the rules of that <lb/>
            art. And the ratio of four to three effects the first harmony, <lb/>
            that in the thirds, which is the diatessaron,</p>
          <p>XXXII. The number seven displays also another beauty <lb/>
            which it possesses, and one which is most sacred to think of. <lb/>
            For as it consists of three and four, it displays in existing <lb/>
            things a line which is free from all deviation and upright by <lb/>
            nature. And in what way it does so I must show.</p>
          <p>The rectangular triangle, which is the beginning of all <lb/>
            qualities, consists of the numbers three* and four, and fivé; <lb/>
            and the three and the four, which are the essence of the seven, <lb/>
            contain the right angle ; for the obtuse angle and the acute <lb/>
            angle show irregularity, and disorder, and inequality; for one <lb/>
            may be more acute or more obtuse than another. But a right <lb/>
            angle does not admit of comparison, nor is one right angle more <lb/>
            a right angle than another : but one remains similar to another, <lb/>
            never changing its peculiar nature. But if the right-angled <lb/>
            triangle is the beginning of all figures and of all qualities, and <lb/>
            if the essence of the number seven, that is to say, the numbers <lb/>
            three and four together, supply the most necessary part of this, <lb/>
            namely, the right angle, then seven may be rightly thought to <lb/>
            be the fountain of every figure and of every quality. And <lb/>
            besides what has been already advanced, this also may be as­ <lb/>
            serted that three is the number of a plane figure, since a point <lb/>
            has been laid down to be, according to a unit, and a line ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the number two, and a plane superficies according to <note type="footnote"> * This discussion about numbers is not very intelligible; but here <lb/>
            Philo is probably referring to the problem of Euclid on the subject <lb/>
            of the square of the hypothenuse. Thus, if 3 and 4 represent the <lb/>
            sides containing the angle, and 5 the side subtending it, we get 3 * 3 = 9;  4 * 4 = 16; 5 * 5 = 25.</note>  <lb/>
               <pb n="29"/>
              to the number three. Also, four is the number of a cube, by <lb/>
              the addition of one to the number of a plane superficies, depth <lb/>
              being added to the superficies. From which it is plain that the <lb/>
              essence of the number seven is the foundation of geometry <lb/>
              and trigonometry ; and in a word, of all incorporeal and corpo­ <lb/>
              real substances.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. And such great sanctity is there in the number <lb/>
            seven, that it has a pre-eminent rank beyond all the other num­ <lb/>
            bers in the first decade. For of the other numbers, some pro­ <lb/>
            duce without being produced, others are produced but have no <lb/>
            productive power themselves ; others again both produce and <lb/>
            are produced. But the number seven alone is contemplated in <lb/>
            no part. And this proposition we must confirm by demonstra­ <lb/>
            tion. Now the number one produces all the other numbers in <lb/>
            order, being itself produced absolutely by no other; and the <lb/>
            number eight is produced by twice four, but itself produces no <lb/>
            other number in the decade, Again, four has the rank of <lb/>
            both, that is, of parents and of offspring; for it produces <lb/>
            eight when doubled, and it is produced by twice two. But <lb/>
            seven alone, as I said before, neither produces nor is produced, <lb/>
            on which account other philosophers liken this number to <lb/>
            Victory, who had no mother, and to the virgin goddess, whom <lb/>
            the fable asserts to have sprung from the head of Jupiter : and <lb/>
            the Pythagoreans compare it to the Ruler of all things. For <lb/>
            that which neither produces, nor is produced, remains immov­ <lb/>
            able. For generation consists in motion, since that which <lb/>
            is generated, cannot be so without motion, both to cause pro­ <lb/>
            duction, and to be produced. And the only thing which <lb/>
            neither moves nor is moved, is the Elder, Ruler, and Lord of <lb/>
            the universe, of whom the number seven may reasonably be <lb/>
            called a likeness. And Philolaus gives his testimony to this <lb/>
            doctrine of mine in the following words :—“For God," says <lb/>
            he " is the ruler and Lord of all things, being one, eternal, <lb/>
            lasting, immovable, himself like to himself, and different from <lb/>
            all other beings."</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Among the things then which are perceptible only <lb/>
            by intellect, the number seven is proved to be the only thing <lb/>
            free from motion and accident; but among things perceptible <lb/>
            by the external senses, it displays a great and comprehensive <lb/>
            power, contributing to the improvement of all terrestrial things, <lb/>
            and affecting even the periodical changes of the moon. And <lb/>
             <pb n="30"/>
            in what manner it does this, we must consider. The number <lb/>
            seven when compounded of numbers beginning with the unit, <lb/>
            makes eight-and-twenty, a perfect number, and one equalised <lb/>
            in its parts. And the number so produced, is calculated to <lb/>
            reproduce the revolutions of the moon, bringing her back to <lb/>
            the point from which she first began to increase in a manner <lb/>
            perceptible by the external senses, and to which she returns by <lb/>
            waning. For she increases from her first crescent-shaped <lb/>
            figure, to that of a half circle in seven days ; and in seven <lb/>
            more, she becomes a full orb; and then again she turns back, <lb/>
            retracing the same path, like a runner of the diaulos,* receding <lb/>
            from an orb full of light, to a half circle again in seven days, <lb/>
            and lastly, in an equal number she diminishes from a half <lb/>
            circle to the form of a crescent; and thus the number before <lb/>
            mentioned is completed. And the number seven by those per­ <lb/>
            sons who are in the habit of employing names with strict pro­ <lb/>
            priety is called the perfecting number ; because by it, every­ <lb/>
            thing is perfected. And any one may receive a confirmation <lb/>
            of this from the fact, that every organic body has three dimen­ <lb/>
            sions, length, depth, and breadth ; and four boundaries, the <lb/>
            point, the line, the superficies, and the solid ; and by these, <lb/>
            when combined, the number seven is made up.</p>
          <p>But it would be impossible for bodies to be measured by <lb/>
            the number seven, according to the combination of the three <lb/>
            dimensions, and the four boundaries, if it did not happen that <lb/>
            the ideas of the first numbers, one, two, three and four, in <lb/>
            in which the number ten is founded, comprised the nature of <lb/>
            the number seven. For the aforesaid numbers have four <lb/>
            boundaries, the first, the second, the third, the fourth, and <lb/>
            three intervals. The first interval being that between one and <lb/>
            two; the second, that between two and three ; the third, that <lb/>
            between three and four.</p>
          <p>XXXV. And besides what has been already said, the growth <lb/>
            of men from infancy to old age, when measured by the num­ <lb/>
            ber seven, displays in a most evident manner its perfecting <lb/>
            power ; for in the first period of seven years, the putting forth <lb/>
            of the teeth takes place. And at the end of the second period <lb/>
            of the same length, he arrives at the age of puberty : at the end <note type="footnote"> * This refers to the Greek games. " The straight race was called <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">στάδιον</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">δρόμος</foreign>. In the <foreign xml:lang="grc">δίαυλος δρόμος</foreign> the runners turned round <lb/>
            the goal, and came back to the starting place.”—Smith in v. Stadium. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="31"/>
            of the third period, the growth of the beard takes place. The <lb/>
            fourth period sees him arrive at the fulness of his manly <lb/>
            strength. The fifth seven years is the season for marriage. In <lb/>
            the sixth period he arrives at the maturity of his understanding. <lb/>
            The seventh period is that of the most rapid improvement and <lb/>
            growth of both his intellectual and reasoning powers. The <lb/>
            eighth is the sum of the perfection of both. In the ninth, his <lb/>
            passions assume a mildness and gentleness, from being to a <lb/>
            great degree tamed. In the tenth, the desirable end of life <lb/>
            comes upon him, while his limbs and organic senses are still <lb/>
            unimpaired: for excessive old age is apt to weaken and en­ <lb/>
            feeble them all.</p>
          <p>And Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, described these different <lb/>
            ages in the following elegiac verses :— <lb/>
            In seven years from th'earliest breath, <lb/>
            The child puts forth his hedge of teeth; <lb/>
            When strengthened by a similar span, <lb/>
            He first displays some signs of man. <lb/>
            As in a third, his limbs increase, <lb/>
            A beard buds o'er his changing face. <lb/>
            When he has passed a fourth such time, <lb/>
            His strength and vigour's in its prime. <lb/>
            When five times seven years o'er his head <lb/>
            Have passed, the man should think to wed ; <lb/>
            At forty two, the wisdom's clear <lb/>
            To shun vile deeds of folly or fear: <lb/>
            While seven times seven years to sense <lb/>
            Add ready wit and eloquence. <lb/>
            And seven years further skill admit <lb/>
            To raise them to their perfect height. <lb/>
            When nine such periods have passed, <lb/>
            His powers, though milder grown, still last; <lb/>
            When God has granted ten times seven, <lb/>
            The aged man prepares for heaven.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Solon therefore thus computes the life of man by <lb/>
            the aforesaid ten periods of seven years. But Hippocrates <lb/>
            the physician says that there are seven* ages of man, infancy, <lb/>
            childhood, boyhood, youth, manhood, middle age, old age; and <lb/>
            that these too, are measured by periods of seven, though not <note type="footnote"> * It is hardly necessary to remind the reader of the description of <lb/>
            the seven ages of man in Shakespeare. As You Like It, Act 11. sc. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="32"/>
            in the same order. And he speaks thus ; "In the nature of <lb/>
            man there are seven seasons, which men call ages; infancy, <lb/>
            childhood, boyhood, and the rest. He is an infant till he <lb/>
            reaches his seventh year, the age of the shedding of his teeth. <lb/>
            He is a child till he arrives at the age of puberty, which takes <lb/>
            place in fourteen years. He is a boy till his beard begins to <lb/>
            grow, and that time is the end of a third period of seven years. <lb/>
            He is a youth till the completion of the growth of his whole <lb/>
            body, which coincides with the fourth seven years. Then he <lb/>
            is a man till he reaches his forty-ninth year, or seven times <lb/>
            seven periods. He is a middle aged mail till he is fifty­ <lb/>
            six, or eight times seven years old ; and after that he is an <lb/>
            old man."</p>
          <p>And it is also affirmed for the particular praise of the num­ <lb/>
            ber seven, that it has a very admirable rank in nature, because <lb/>
            it is composed of three and four. And if anyone doubles the <lb/>
            the third number after the unit, he will find a square ; and if <lb/>
            he doubles the fourth number, he will find a cube. And if he <lb/>
            doubles the seventh from both, he will both a cube and a <lb/>
            square ; therefore, the third number from the unit is a square <lb/>
            in a double ratio. And the fourth number, eight, is a cube. <lb/>
            And the seventh number, being sixty-four, is both a cube and a <lb/>
            square at the same time ; so that the seventh number is really <lb/>
            a perfecting one, signifying both equalities,—the plane super­ <lb/>
            ficies by the square, according to the connection with the num­ <lb/>
            ber three, and the solid by the cube according to its relation­ <lb/>
            ship to the number four; and of the numbers three and four, <lb/>
            are composed the number seven.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. But this number is not only a perfecter of things, <lb/>
            but it is also, so to say, the most harmonious of numbers ; and <lb/>
            in a manner the source of that most beautiful diagram which <lb/>
            describes all the harmonies, that of fourths, and that of fifths, <lb/>
            and the diapason. It also comprises all the proportions, the <lb/>
            arithmetical, the geometrical, and moreover the harmonic <lb/>
            proportion. And the square consists of these numbers, six, eight, <lb/>
            nine, and twelve ; and eight bears to six the ratio of being one <lb/>
            third greater, which is the diatessaron of harmony. And nine <lb/>
            bears to six the ratio of being half as great again, which is the <lb/>
            ratio of fifths. And twelve is to six, in a twofold proportion ; <lb/>
            and this is the same as the diapason. The number seven <lb/>
            comprises also, as I have said, all the proportions of arith­ <lb/>
             <pb n="33"/>
            metrical proportion, from the numbers six, and nine, and <lb/>
            twelve; for as the number in the middle exceeds the first <lb/>
            number by three, it is also exceeded by three by the last num­ <lb/>
            ber. And geometrical proportion is according to these four <lb/>
            numbers. For the same ratio that eight bears to six, that <lb/>
            also does twelve bear to nine. And this is the ratio of thirds. <lb/>
            Harmonic ratio consists of three numbers, six, and eight, and <lb/>
            twelve. But there are two ways of judging of harmonic pro­ <lb/>
            portion. One when, whatever ratio the last number bears to <lb/>
            the first, the excess by which the last number exceeds the <lb/>
            middle one is the same as the excess by which the middle <lb/>
            number exceeds the first. And any one may derive a most <lb/>
            evident proof of this from the numbers before mentioned, six, <lb/>
            and eight, and twelve : for the last number is double the first. <lb/>
            And again, the excess of twelve over eight is double the <lb/>
            excess of eight over six. For the number twelve exceeds <lb/>
            eight by four, and eight exceeds six by two; and four is the <lb/>
            double of two. And another test of harmonic proportion is, <lb/>
            when the middle term exceeds and is exceeded by those on <lb/>
            each side of it, by an equal portion ; for eight being the middle <lb/>
            term, exceeds the first term by a third part; for if six be sub­ <lb/>
            tracted from it, the remainder two is one third of the original <lb/>
            number six : and it is exceeded by the last term in an equal <lb/>
            proportion ; for if eight be taken from twelve, the remainder <lb/>
            four is one third of the whole number twelve.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Let this then be premised, as of necessity it <lb/>
            must, respecting the honourable qualities which this diagram <lb/>
            or square has, and the name to which it is entitled, and the <lb/>
            number seven unfolds an equal number of ideas, and even <lb/>
            more in the case of incorporeal things, which are perceptible <lb/>
            only by the intellect: and its nature extends also over every <lb/>
            visible essence, reaching to both heaven and earth, which are <lb/>
            the boundaries of every thing. For what portion of all the things <lb/>
            on earth is there which is not fond of seven ; being subdued by <lb/>
            an affection and longing for the seventh. Accordingly men say, <lb/>
            that the heaven is girdled with seven circles, the names of which <lb/>
            are as follows; the arctic, the antarctic, the summer tropic, <lb/>
            the winter tropic, the equinoctial, the zodiac, and last of all <lb/>
            the galaxy. For the horizon is something which affects our­ <lb/>
            selves, in proportion as any one has acute vision, or the con­ <lb/>
            trary; our sensation cutting off at one time a lesser, and at <note type="footnote"> D </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="34"/>
            another time a greater circumference. The planets too, and <lb/>
            the corresponding host of fixed stars, are arrayed in seven di­ <lb/>
            visions, displaying a very great sympathy with the air and the <lb/>
            earth. For they turn the air towards the times, that are <lb/>
            called the seasons of the year, causing in each of them innume­ <lb/>
            rable changes by calm weather, and pleasant breezes, and <lb/>
            clouds, and irresistible blasts of wind. And again, they make <lb/>
            rivers to overflow and to subside, and turn plains into lakes; <lb/>
            and again, on the contrary, they dry up the waters: they also <lb/>
            cause the alterations of the seas, when they recede, and re­ <lb/>
            turn with a reflux. For at times, when the tide recedes on <lb/>
            a sudden, an extensive line of shore occupies what is usually a <lb/>
            wide gulf of set ; and in a short time afterwards, the waters are <lb/>
            brought back, and there appears a sea, sailed over, not by <lb/>
            shallow boats, but by ships of exceeding great burden.</p>
          <p>And they also give increase and perfection to all the terres­ <lb/>
            trial animals and plants which produce fruit, endowing each <lb/>
            with a nature to last a long time, so that new plants may <lb/>
            flourish and come to maturity ;—the old ones having passed <lb/>
            away, in order to provide an abundant supply of necessary things.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Moreover, the constellation Ursa Major, which <lb/>
            men call the guide of mariners, consists of seven stars, <lb/>
            which the pilots keeping in view, steer in innumerable paths <lb/>
            across the sea, directing their endeavours towards an incre­ <lb/>
            dible task, beyond the capacity of human intellect. For it is <lb/>
            through conjectures, directed by the aforementioned stars, that <lb/>
            they have discovered countries which were previously unknown ; <lb/>
            those who dwell on the continent having discovered islands, <lb/>
            and islanders having found out continents. For it was fitting <lb/>
            that the recesses both of earth and sea should be revealed <lb/>
            to that God-loving animal, the race of mankind, by the purest <lb/>
            of essences, namely heaven.</p>
          <p>And besides the stars above mentioned the band of the <lb/>
            Pleiades is also made up of seven stars, the rising and occulta. <lb/>
            tion of which are the causes of great benefits to all men. <lb/>
            For when they set, the furrows are ploughed up for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of sowing; and when they are about to rise, they bring <lb/>
            glad tidings of harvest; and after they have arisen, they awaken <lb/>
            the rejoicing husbandman to the collection of their necessary <lb/>
            food. And they with joy store up their food for their daily <lb/>
            use. And the sun, the ruler of the day, making two equinoxes <lb/>
             <pb n="35"/>
            every year, both in spring and autumn. The spring equinox <lb/>
            in the constellation of Aries, and the autumnal one in Libra, <lb/>
            gives the most evident demonstration possible of the divine <lb/>
            dignity of the number seven. For each of the equinoxes takes <lb/>
            place in the seventh month, at which time men are expressly <lb/>
            commanded by law to celebrate the greatest and most popu­ <lb/>
            lar and comprehensive festivals; since it is owing to both <lb/>
            these seasons, that all the fruits of the earth are engendered <lb/>
            and brought to perfection; the fruit of corn, and all other <lb/>
            things which are sown, being owing to the vernal equinox; <lb/>
            and that of the vine, and of all the other plants which bear <lb/>
            hard berries, of which there are great numbers, to the autum­ <lb/>
            nal one.</p>
          <p>XL. And since all the things on the earth depend upon the <lb/>
            heavenly bodies according to a certain natural sympathy, it is <lb/>
            in heaven too that the ratio of the number seven began, and <lb/>
            from thence it descended to us also, coming down to visit the <lb/>
            race of mortal men. And so again, besides the dominant part <lb/>
            of our mind, our soul is divided into seven divisions ; there <lb/>
            being five senses, and besides them the vocal organ, and after <lb/>
            that the generative power. All which things, like the puppets in <lb/>
            a raree show, which are moved by strings by the manager, are at <lb/>
            one time quiet, and at another time in motion, each according <lb/>
            to its suitable habits and capacities of motion.</p>
          <p>And in the same way, if any one were to set about investi­ <lb/>
            gating the different parts of the body, in both their interior and <lb/>
            the exterior arrangement, lie will in each case find seven divi­ <lb/>
            sions. Those which are visible are as follow ;-the head, the <lb/>
            chest, the belly, two arms, and two legs; the internal parts, or <lb/>
            the entrails, as they are called, are the stomach, the heart, the <lb/>
            lungs, the spleen, the liver, and the two kidneys. Again, the <lb/>
            principal and dominant part in an animal is the head, and <lb/>
            that has seven most necessary divisions : two eyes, an equal <lb/>
            number of ears, two channels for the nostrils, and the mouth <lb/>
            to make up seven, through which as Plato says, mortal things <lb/>
            find their entrance, and immortal things their exit. For into <lb/>
            the mouth do enter meat and drink, perishable food of a perish­ <lb/>
            able body ; but from out of it proceed words-the immortal <lb/>
            laws of an immortal soul, by means of which rational life is <lb/>
            regulated.</p>
          <p>XLI. Again, the things which are judged of by the best of <note type="footnote">D 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="36"/>
            the senses, sight, partake of number according to their kind. <lb/>
            For the things which are seen are seven; body, distance, <lb/>
            shape, magnitude, colour, motion, tranquillity, and besides these <lb/>
            there is nothing. It also happens that all the changes of the <lb/>
            voice amount to seven ; the acute, the grave, the contracted,' <lb/>
            in the fourth place the aspirated sound, the fifth is the tone, <lb/>
            the sixth the long, the seventh the short sound.</p>
          <p>There are also seven motions ; the motion upwards, the <lb/>
            motion downwards, that to the right, that to the left, the for­ <lb/>
            ward motion, the backward motion, and the rotatory motion, <lb/>
            as is most especially shown by those who exhibit dances. It <lb/>
            is affirmed also that the secretions of the body are performed <lb/>
            in the aforesaid number of seven. For tears are poured out <lb/>
            through the eyes, and the purifications of the head through the <lb/>
            nostrils, and through the mouth the saliva which is spit out; <lb/>
            there are, besides two other channels for the evacuation of the <lb/>
            superfluities of the body, the one being placed in front and the <lb/>
            the other behind ; the sixth mode of evacuation is the effusion <lb/>
            of perspiration over the whole body, and the seventh that most <lb/>
            natural exercise of the generative powers. Again, in the case <lb/>
            of women, the flux called the catamenia, is usually carried on <lb/>
            for seven days. Also, children in the womb receive life at the <lb/>
            end of seven months, so that a very extraordinary thing hap­ <lb/>
            pens : for children who are born at the end of the seventh <lb/>
            month live, while those who are born at the expiration of the <lb/>
            eighth month are altogether incapable of surviving.</p>
          <p>Again, the dangerous diseases of the body, especially when <lb/>
            lasting fevers, arising from the distemperature of the powers <lb/>
            within us, attack us, are usually decided about the seventh <lb/>
            day. For that day determines the contest for life, allotting safety <lb/>
            to some men, and death to others.</p>
          <p>XLII. And the power of this number does not exist only in <lb/>
            the instances already mentioned, but it also pervades the most <lb/>
            excellent of the sciences, the knowledge of grammar and music. <lb/>
            For the lyre with seven strings, bearing a proportion to the as­ <lb/>
            semblage of the seven planets, perfects its admirable harmonies, <lb/>
            being almost the chief of all instruments which are conversant <lb/>
            about music. And of the elements of grammar, those which are <lb/>
            properly called vowels are. correctly speaking, seven in number, <lb/>
            since they can be sounded by themselves, and when they are <lb/>
            combined with other letters, they make complete sounds ; for <lb/>
             <pb n="37"/>
            they fill up the deficiency existing in semi-vowels, making the <lb/>
            sounds whole ; and they change and alter the natures of the <lb/>
            mutes inspiring them with their own power, in order that what <lb/>
            has no sound may become endowed with sound. On which ac­ <lb/>
            count it appears to me that they also originally gave letters <lb/>
            their names, and acting as became wise men, did give the name <lb/>
            to the number seven from the respect* they had for it, and <lb/>
            from regard to the dignity inherent in it. But the Romans, <lb/>
            adding the letter S, which had been omitted by the Greeks, <lb/>
            show still more conspicuously the correct etymological meaning <lb/>
            of the word, calling it septem, as derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεμνὸς</foreign>, vene­ <lb/>
            rable, as has been said before, and from <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεβασμὸς</foreign>, veneration.</p>
          <p>XLIII. These things, and more still are said in a philo­ <lb/>
            sophical spirit about the number seven, on account of which it <lb/>
            has received the highest honours, in the highest nature. And <lb/>
            it is honoured by those of the highest reputation among both <lb/>
            Greeks and barbarians, who devote themselves to mathematical <lb/>
            sciences. It was also greatly honoured by Moses, a man much <lb/>
            attached to excellence of all sorts, who described its beauty on <lb/>
            the most holy pillars of the law, and wrote it in the hearts of all <lb/>
            those who were subject to him, commanding them at the end of <lb/>
            each period of six days to keep the seventh holy; abstaining <lb/>
            from all other works which are done in the seeking after and <lb/>
            providing the means of life, devoting that day to the single <lb/>
            object of philosophizing with a view to the improvement of <lb/>
            their morals, and the examination of their consciences: for <lb/>
            conscience being seated in the soul as a judge, is not afraid to <lb/>
            reprove men, sometimes employing pretty vehement threats ; at <lb/>
            other times by milder admonitions, using threats in regard to <lb/>
            matters where men appear to be disobedient, of deliberate pur­ <lb/>
            pose, and admonitions when their offences seem involuntary, <lb/>
            through want of foresight, in order to prevent their hereafter <lb/>
            offending in a similar manner.</p>
          <p>XLIV. So Moses, summing up his account of the creation <lb/>
            of the world, says in a brief style, " This is the book of the <lb/>
            creation of the heaven and of the earth, when it took place, in <lb/>
            the day on which God made the heaven and the earth, and <lb/>
            every green herb before it appeared upon the earth, and all <lb/>
            the grass of the field before it sprang up." Does he not here <note type="footnote"> * The word used is <foreign xml:lang="grc">σεβασμὸς</foreign>, as if <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐβδομὰς</foreign> were derived from that; <lb/>
            and the Romans formed septem from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑπτὰ</foreign>, by the addition of s. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="38"/>
            manifestly set before us incorporeal ideas perceptible only by <lb/>
            the intellect, which have been appointed to be as seals of the <lb/>
            perfected works, perceptible by the outward senses. For before <lb/>
            the earth was green, he says that this same thing, verdure, ex­ <lb/>
            isted in the nature of things, and before the grass sprang up in <lb/>
            the field, there was grass though it was not visible. And we <lb/>
            must understand in the case of every thing else which is de­ <lb/>
            cided on by the external senses, there were elder forms and <lb/>
            motions previously existing, according to which the things which <lb/>
            were created were fashioned and measured out. For although <lb/>
            Moses did not describe everything collectively, but only a part <lb/>
            of what existed, as he was desirous of brevity, beyond all men <lb/>
            that ever wrote, still the few things which he has mentioned <lb/>
            are examples of the nature of all, for nature perfects none of <lb/>
            those which are perceptible to the outward senses without an <lb/>
            incorporeal model.</p>
          <p>XLV. Then, preserving the natural order of things, and <lb/>
            having a regard to the connection between what comes afterwards <lb/>
            and what has gone before, he says next, "And a fountain went up <lb/>
            from the earth and watered the whole face of the earth." For <lb/>
            other philosophers affirm that all water is one of the four ele­ <lb/>
            ments of which the world was composed. But Moses, who was <lb/>
            accustomed to contemplate and comprehend matters with a more <lb/>
            acute and far-sighted vision, considers thus : the vast sea is an <lb/>
            element, being a fourth part of the entire universe, which the <lb/>
            men after him denominated the ocean, while they look upon the <lb/>
            smaller seas which we sail over in the light of harbours. And <lb/>
            he drew a distinction between the sweet and drinkable water <lb/>
            and that of the sea, attributing the former to the earth, and <lb/>
            considering it a portion of the earth, rather than of the ocean, <lb/>
            on account of the reason which I have already mentioned, that <lb/>
            is to say, that the earth may be held together by the sweet <lb/>
            qualities of the water as by a chain; the water acting in the <lb/>
            manner of glue. For if the earth were left entirely dry, so <lb/>
            that no moisture arose and penetrated through its holes rising <lb/>
            to the surface in various directions, it would split. But now it <lb/>
            is held together, and remains lasting, partly by the force of the <lb/>
            wind which unites it, and partly because the moisture does not <lb/>
            allow it to become dry, and so to be broken up into larger and <lb/>
            smaller fragments.</p>
          <p>This is one reason ; and we must also mention another, <lb/>
             <pb n="39"/>
            which is aimed at the truth like an arrow at a mark. It is not <lb/>
            the nature of anything upon the earth to exist without a moist <lb/>
            essence. And this is indicated by the throwing of seed, which <lb/>
            is either moist, as the seed of animals, or else does not shoot up <lb/>
            without moisture, such as the seeds of plants ; from which it is <lb/>
            evident that it follows that the aforesaid moist essence must be <lb/>
            a portion of the earth which produces everything, just as the <lb/>
            flux of the catamenia is a part of women. For by men who are <lb/>
            learned in natural philosophy, this also is said to be the cor­ <lb/>
            poreal essence of children. Nor is what we are about to say <lb/>
            inconsistent with what has been said ; for nature has bestowed <lb/>
            upon every mother, as a most indispensable part of her con­ <lb/>
            formation, breasts gushing forth like fountains, having in this <lb/>
            manner provided abundant food for the child that is to be <lb/>
            born. And the earth also, as it seems, is a mother, from <lb/>
            which consideration it occurred to the early ages to call her <lb/>
            Demetra, combining the names of mother and earth <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">δη</foreign>). For it is not the earth which imitates the woman, as <lb/>
            Plato has said, but the woman who has imitated the earth which <lb/>
            the race of poets has been accustomed with truth to call the <lb/>
            mother of all things, and the fruit-bearer, and the .-giver of all <lb/>
            things, since she is at the same time the cause of the generation <lb/>
            and durability of all things, to the animals and plants. Rightly, <lb/>
            therefore, did nature bestow on the earth as the eldest and most <lb/>
            fertile of mothers, streams of rivers, and fountains like <lb/>
            breasts, in order that the plants might be watered, and that all <lb/>
            living things might have abundant supplies of drink.</p>
          <p>XLVI. After this, Moses says that " God made man, <lb/>
            having taken clay from the earth, and he breathed into his <lb/>
            face the breath of life." And by this expression lie shows <lb/>
            most clearly that there is a vast difference between man as <lb/>
            generated now, and the first man who was made according to <lb/>
            the image of God. For man as formed now is perceptible to <lb/>
            the external senses, partaking of qualities, consisting of body <lb/>
            and soul, man or woman, by nature mortal. But man, made <lb/>
            according to the image of God, was an idea, or a genus, or a <lb/>
            seal, perceptible only by the intellect, incorporeal, neither male <lb/>
            nor female, imperishable by nature. But he asserts that the <lb/>
            formation of the individual man, perceptible by the external <lb/>
            senses is a composition of earthy substance, and divine spirit. <lb/>
            For that the body was created by the Creator taking a lump of <lb/>
             <pb n="40"/>
            clay, and fashioning the human form out of it; but that the <lb/>
            soul proceeds from no created thing at all, but from the Father <lb/>
            and Ruler of all things. For when he uses the expression, <lb/>
            " he breathed into," &amp;c., he means nothing else than the divine <lb/>
            spirit proceeding from that happy and blessed nature, sent to <lb/>
            take up its habitation here on earth, for the advantage of our <lb/>
            race, in order that, even if man is mortal according to that <lb/>
            portion of him which is visible, he may at all events be immortal <lb/>
            according to that portion which is invisible ; and for this reason, <lb/>
            one may properly say that man is on the boundaries of a better <lb/>
            and an immortal nature, partaking of each as far as it is ne­ <lb/>
            cessary for him ; and that he was born at the same time, <lb/>
            both mortal and the immortal. Mortal as to his body, but <lb/>
            immortal as to his intellect.</p>
          <p>XLVII. But the original man, he who was created out of <lb/>
            the clay, the primeval founder of all our race, appears to me <lb/>
            to have been most excellent in both particulars, in both soul <lb/>
            and body, and to have been very far superior to all the men of <lb/>
            subsequent ages from his pre-eminent excellence in both parts. <lb/>
            For he in truth was really good and perfect. And one may <lb/>
            form a conjecture of the perfection of his bodily beauty from <lb/>
            three 'considerations, the first of which is this : when the <lb/>
            earth was now but lately formed by its separation from that <lb/>
            abundant quantity of water which was called the sea, it hap­ <lb/>
            pened that the materials out of which the things just created <lb/>
            were formed were unmixed, uncorrupted, and pure ; and the <lb/>
            things made from this material were naturally free from all <lb/>
            imperfection. The second consideration is that it is not likely <lb/>
            that God made this figure in the present form of a man, work­ <lb/>
            ing with the most sublime care, after he had taken the clay <lb/>
            from any chance portion of earth, but that he selected carefully <lb/>
            the most excellent clay of all the earth, of the pure material <lb/>
            choosing the finest and most carefully sifted portion, such as <lb/>
            was especially fit for the formation of the work which he had <lb/>
            in hand. For it was an abode or sacred temple for a reason­ <lb/>
            able soul which was being made, the image of which he was <lb/>
            about to carry in his heart, being the most God-like looking <lb/>
            of images. The third consideration is one which admits of no <lb/>
            comparison with those which have been already mentioned, <lb/>
            namely, this: the Creator was good both in other respects, <lb/>
            and also in knowledge, so that every one of the parts of the <lb/>
             <pb n="41"/>
            body had separately the numbers which were suited to it, and <lb/>
            was also accurately completed in the admirable adaptation to <lb/>
            the share in the universe of which it was to partake. And <lb/>
            after he had endowed it with fair proportions, he clothed it <lb/>
            with beauty of flesh, and embellished it with an exquisite corn­ <lb/>
            plexion, wishing, as far as was possible, that man should <lb/>
            appear the most beautiful of beings.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. And that he is superior to all these animals in <lb/>
            regard of his soul, is plain. For God does not seem to have <lb/>
            availed himself of any other animal existing in creation as his <lb/>
            model in the formation of man ; but to have been guided, as I <lb/>
            have said before, by his own reason alone. On which account, <lb/>
            Moses affirms that this man was an image and imitation of <lb/>
            God, being breathed into in his face in which is the place of <lb/>
            the sensations, by which the Creator endowed the body with a <lb/>
            soul. Then, having placed the mind in the dominant part as <lb/>
            king, he gave him as a body of satellites, the different powers <lb/>
            calculated to perceive colours and sounds, and flavours and <lb/>
            odours, and other things of similar kinds, which man could <lb/>
            never have distinguished by his own resources without the sen­ <lb/>
            sations. And it follows of necessity that an imitation of a <lb/>
            perfectly beautiful model must itself be perfectly beautiful, for <lb/>
            the word of God surpasses even that beauty which exists in the <lb/>
            nature which is perceptible only by the external senses, not <lb/>
            being embellished by any adventitious beauty, but being itself, <lb/>
            if one must speak the truth, its most exquisite embellishment.</p>
          <p>XLIX. The first man, therefore, appears to me to have <lb/>
            been such both in his body and in his soul, being very far supe­ <lb/>
            rior to all those who live in the present day, and to all those who <lb/>
            have gone before us. For our generation has been from men : <lb/>
            but he was created by God. And in the same proportion as <lb/>
            the one Author of being is superior to the other, so too is the <lb/>
            being that is produced. For as that which is in its prime is <lb/>
            superior to that the beauty of which is gone by, whether it be <lb/>
            an animal, or a plant, or fruit, or anything else whatever of the <lb/>
            productions of nature ; so also the first man who was ever <lb/>
            formed appears to have been the height of perfection of our <lb/>
            entire race, and subsequent generations appear never to have <lb/>
            reached an equal state of perfection, but to have at all times <lb/>
            been inferior both in their appearance and in their power, and <lb/>
            to have been constantly degenerating, which same thing I have <lb/>
             <pb n="42"/>
            also seen to be the case in the instance of the sculptors' and <lb/>
            painters' art. For the imitations always fall short of the ori­ <lb/>
            ginal models. And those works which are painted or fashioned <lb/>
            from models must be much more inferior, as being still further <lb/>
            removed from the original. And the stone which is called the <lb/>
            magnet is subject to a similar deterioration. For any iron ring <lb/>
            which touches it is held by it as firmly as possible, but another <lb/>
            which only touches that ring is held less firmly. And the third <lb/>
            ring hangs from the second, and the fourth from the third, and <lb/>
            the fifth from the fourth, and so on one from another in a long <lb/>
            chain, being all held together by one attractive power, but still <lb/>
            they are not all supported in the same degree. For those which <lb/>
            are suspended at a distance from the original attraction, are <lb/>
            held more loosely, because the attractive power is weakened, <lb/>
            and is no longer able to bind them in an equal'degree.</p>
          <p>And the race of mankind appears to be subject to an in­ <lb/>
            fluence of the same kind, since in men the faculties and dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive qualities of both body and soul are less vivid an'd <lb/>
            strongly marked in each succeeding generation. And we shall <lb/>
            be only saying what is the plain truth, if we call the original <lb/>
            founder of our race not only the first man, but also the first <lb/>
            citizen of the world. For the world was his house and his <lb/>
            city, while he had as yet no structure made by hands and <lb/>
            wrought out of the materials of wood and stone. And in this <lb/>
            world lie lived as in his'own country, in all safety, removed from <lb/>
            any fear, inasmuch as he had been thought worthy of the do­ <lb/>
            minion over all earthly things; and had everything that was <lb/>
            mortal crouching before him, and taught to obey him as their <lb/>
            master, or else constrained to do so by superior force, and <lb/>
            living himself surrounded by all the joys which peace can be­ <lb/>
            stow without a struggle and without reproach.</p>
          <p>L. But since every city in which laws are properly estab­ <lb/>
            lished, has a regular constitution, it became necessary for this <lb/>
            citizen of the world to adopt the same constitution as that <lb/>
            which prevailed in the universal world. And this constitution <lb/>
            is the right reason of nature, which in more appropriate lan­ <lb/>
            guage is denominated law, being a divine arrangement in ac­ <lb/>
            cordance with which everything suitable and appropriate is <lb/>
            assigned to every individual. But of this city and constitution <lb/>
            there must have been some citizens before man, who might be <lb/>
            justly called citizens of a mighty city, having received the <lb/>
             <pb n="43"/>
            greatest imaginable circumference to dwell in ; and having <lb/>
            been enrolled in the largest and most perfect commonwealth. <lb/>
            And who could these have been but rational divine natures, <lb/>
            some of them incorporeal and perceptible only by intellect, and <lb/>
            others not destitute of bodily substance, such in fact as the <lb/>
            stars ? And he who associated with and lived among them was <lb/>
            naturally living in a state of unmixed happiness. And being <lb/>
            akin and nearly related to the ruler of all, inasmuch as a great <lb/>
            deal of the divine spirit had flowed into him, he was eager both <lb/>
            to say and to do everything which might please his father and <lb/>
            his king, following him step by step in the paths which the <lb/>
            virtues prepare and make plain, as those in which those souls <lb/>
            alone are permitted to proceed who consider the attaining a <lb/>
            likeness to God who made them as the proper end of their <lb/>
            existence.</p>
          <p>LI. We have now then set forth the beauty of the first <lb/>
            created man in both respects, in body and soul, if in a way <lb/>
            much inferior to the reality, still to the extent of our power, <lb/>
            and the best of our ability. And it cannot be but that his <lb/>
            descendants, who all partake of his original character, must <lb/>
            preserve some traces of their relationship to their father, <lb/>
            though they may be but faint. And what is this relationship ? <lb/>
            Every man in regard of his intellect is connected with divine <lb/>
            reason, being an impression of, or a fragment or a ray of <lb/>
            that blessed nature ; but in regard of the structure of his body <lb/>
            he is connected with the universal world. For he is composed <lb/>
            of the same materials as the world, that is of earth, and water, <lb/>
            and air and fire, each of the elements having contributed its <lb/>
            appropriate part towards the completion of most sufficient ma­ <lb/>
            terials, which the Creator was to take in order to fashion this <lb/>
            visible image. And, moreover, mail dwells among all the <lb/>
            things that have been just enumerated, as most appropriate <lb/>
            places having the closest connection with himself, changing <lb/>
            his abode, and going at different times to different places. So <lb/>
            that one may say with the most perfect propriety that mail is <lb/>
            every kind of animal, terrestrial, aquatic, flying, and celestial. <lb/>
            For inasmuch as he dwells and walks upon the earth he is a <lb/>
            terrestrial animal; but inasmuch as he often dives and swims, <lb/>
            and sails, he is an aquatic creature. And merchants and cap­ <lb/>
            tains of ships and purple dyers, and all those who let down <lb/>
            their nets for oysters and fish, are a very clear proof of what is <lb/>
             <pb n="44"/>
            here said. Again, inasmuch as his body is raised at times <lb/>
            above the earth and uses high paths, lie may with justice be <lb/>
            pronounced a creature who traverses the air; and, moreover, <lb/>
            he is a celestial animal, by reason of that most important of <lb/>
            the senses, sight; being by it brought near the sun and moon, <lb/>
            and each of the stars, whether planets or fixed stars.</p>
          <p>LII. And with great beauty Moses has attributed the giving <lb/>
            of names to the different animals to the first created man, for <lb/>
            it is a work of wisdom and indicative of royal authority, and <lb/>
            man was full of intuitive wisdom and self-taught, having been <lb/>
            created by the grace of God, and, moreover, was a king. And <lb/>
            it is proper for a ruler to give names to each of his subjects. <lb/>
            And, as was very natural, the power of domination was exces­ <lb/>
            sive in that first-created man, whom God formed with great <lb/>
            care and thought worthy of the second rank in the creation, <lb/>
            making him his own viceroy and the ruler of all other crea­ <lb/>
            tures. Since even those who have been born so many genera­ <lb/>
            tions afterwards, when the race is becoming weakened by reason <lb/>
            of the long intervals of time that have elapsed since the be­ <lb/>
            ginning of the world, do still exert the same power over the <lb/>
            irrational beasts, preserving as it were a spark of the dominion <lb/>
            and power which has been handed down to them by succession <lb/>
            from their first ancestor.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, Moses says, that " God brought all the animals <lb/>
            to man, wishing to see what names he would give to each." <lb/>
            Not because he was in doubt, for nothing is unknown to God, <lb/>
            but because he knew that he had formed in mortal man a <lb/>
            rational nature capable of moving of its own accord, in order <lb/>
            that he might be free from all participation in vice. But he <lb/>
            was now trying him as a master might try his pupil, stirring <lb/>
            up the disposition which he had implanted in him ; and more­ <lb/>
            over exciting him to a contemplation of his own works, that he <lb/>
            might extemporise them names which should not be inappro­ <lb/>
            priate nor unbecoming, but which should well and clearly dis­ <lb/>
            play the peculiar qualities of the different subjects. For as <lb/>
            the rational nature was as yet uncorrupted in the soul, and as <lb/>
            no weakness, or disease, or affliction had as yet come upon it, <lb/>
            man having most pure and perfect perceptions of bodies and <lb/>
            of things, devised names for them with great felicity and cor­ <lb/>
            rectness of judgment, forming very admirable opinions as to the <lb/>
            qualities which they displayed, so that their natures were at <lb/>
             <pb n="45"/>
            once perceived and correctly described by him. And he was <lb/>
            so excellent in all good things that he speedily arrived at the <lb/>
            very perfection of human happiness.</p>
          <p>LIII. But since nothing in creation lasts for ever, but all <lb/>
            mortal things are liable to inevitable changes and alterations, <lb/>
            it was unavoidable that the first man should also undergo some <lb/>
            disaster. And the beginning of his life being liable to re­ <lb/>
            proach, was his wife. For, as long as he was single, he <lb/>
            resembled, as to his creation, both the world and God ; and he <lb/>
            represented in his soul the characteristics of the nature of each, <lb/>
            I do not mean all of them, but such as a mortal constitution <lb/>
            was capable of admitting. But when woman also was created, <lb/>
            man perceiving a closely connected figure and a kindred for­ <lb/>
            mation to his own, rejoiced at the sight, and approached her <lb/>
            and embraced her. And she, in like manner, beholding a <lb/>
            creature greatly resembling herself, rejoiced also, and addressed <lb/>
            him in reply with due modesty. And love being engendered, <lb/>
            and, as it were, uniting two separate portions of one animal <lb/>
            into one body, adapted them to each other, implanting in each <lb/>
            of them a desire of connection with the other with a view to <lb/>
            the generation of a being similar to themselves. And this <lb/>
            desire caused likewise pleasure to their bodies, which is the <lb/>
            beginning of iniquities and transgressions, and it is owing to <lb/>
            this that men have exchanged their previously immortal and <lb/>
            happy existence for one which is mortal and full of mis­ <lb/>
            fortune.</p>
          <p>LIV. But while man was still living a solitary life, and <lb/>
            before woman was created, the history relates that a paradise <lb/>
            was planted by God in no respect resembling the parks which <lb/>
            are seen among men now. For parks of our day are only life­ <lb/>
            less woods, -full of all kinds of trees, some evergreen with a <lb/>
            view to the undisturbed delectation of the sight; others bud­ <lb/>
            ding and germinating in the spring season, and producing <lb/>
            fruit, some eatable by men, and sufficient, not only for the ne­ <lb/>
            cessary support of nature as food, but also for the superfluous <lb/>
            enjoyment of luxurious life ; and some not eatable by men, but <lb/>
            of necessity bestowed upon the beasts. But in the paradise, <lb/>
            made by God, all the plants were endowed in the souls and <lb/>
            reason, producing for their fruit the different virtues, and, <lb/>
            moreover, imperishable wisdom and prudence, by which honour­ <lb/>
            able and dishonourable things are distinguished from one <lb/>
             <pb n="46"/>
            another, and also a life free from disease, and exempt from <lb/>
            corruption, and all other qualities corresponding to these al­ <lb/>
            ready mentioned. And these statements appear to me to be <lb/>
            dictated by a philosophy which is symbolical rather than strictly <lb/>
            accurate. For no trees of life or of knowledge have ever at <lb/>
            any previous time appeared upon the earth, nor is it likely that <lb/>
            any will appear hereafter. But I rather conceive that Moses <lb/>
            was speaking in an allegorical spirit, intending by his paradise <lb/>
            to intimate the dominant character of the soul, which is full of <lb/>
            innumerable opinions as this figurative paradise was of trees. <lb/>
            And by the tree of life he was shadowing out the greatest of <lb/>
            the virtues-namely, piety towards the gods, by means of <lb/>
            which the soul is made immortal; and by the tree which had <lb/>
            the knowledge of good and evil, he was intimating that wisdom <lb/>
            and moderation, by means of which things,' contrary in their <lb/>
            nature to one another, are distinguished.</p>
          <p>LV. Therefore, having laid down these to be boundaries as <lb/>
            it were in the soul, God then, like a judge, began to consider <lb/>
            to which side men would be most inclined by nature. And <lb/>
            when he saw that the disposition of man had a tendency to <lb/>
            wickedness, and was but little inclined to holiness or piety, by <lb/>
            which qualities an immortal life is secured, he drove them <lb/>
            forth as was very natural, and banished him from paradise; <lb/>
            giving no hope of any subsequent restoration to his soul which <lb/>
            had sinned in such a desperate and irremediable manner. <lb/>
            Since even the opportunity of deceit was blameable in no <lb/>
            slight degree, which I must not pass-over in this place.</p>
          <p>It is said that the old poisonous and earthborn reptile, the <lb/>
            serpent, uttered the voice of a man. And he on one occasion <lb/>
            coming to the wife of the first created man, reproached her' <lb/>
            with her slowness and her excessive prudence, because she <lb/>
            delayed and hesitated to gather the fruit which was com­ <lb/>
            pletely beautiful to look at, and exceedingly sweet to enjoy, <lb/>
            and was, moreover, most useful as being a means by which <lb/>
            men might be able to distinguish between good and evil. And <lb/>
            she, without any inquiry, prompted by an unstable and rash <lb/>
            mind, acquiesced in his advice, and ate of the fruit, and gave <lb/>
            a portion of it to her husband. And this conduct suddenly <lb/>
            changed both of them from innocence and simplicity of cba­ <lb/>
            racter to all kinds of wickedness ; at which the Father of all <lb/>
            was indignant. For their actions deserved his anger, inasmuch <lb/>
             <pb n="47"/>
            as they, passing by the tree of eternal life, the tree which <lb/>
            might have endowed them with perfection of virtue, and by <lb/>
            means of which they might have enjoyed a long and happy life, <lb/>
            preferred a brief and mortal (I will not call it life, but) time <lb/>
            full of unhappiness ; and, accordingly, he appointed them such <lb/>
            punishment as was befitting.</p>
          <p>LVI. And these things are not mere fabulous inventions, <lb/>
            in which the race of poets and sophists delights, but are rather <lb/>
            types shadowing forth some allegorical truth, according to some <lb/>
            mystical explanation. And any one who follows a reasonable <lb/>
            train of conjecture, will say with great propriety, that the <lb/>
            aforesaid serpent is the symbol of pleasure, because in the first <lb/>
            place lie is destitute of feet, and crawls on his belly with his <lb/>
            face downwards. In the second place, because he uses lumps <lb/>
            of clay for food. Thirdly, because he bears poison in his teetb, <lb/>
            by which it is his nature to kill those who are bitten by him. <lb/>
            And the man devoted to pleasure is free from none of the <lb/>
            aforementioned evils; for it is with difficulty that he can <lb/>
            raise his head, being weighed down and dragged down, since <lb/>
            intemperance trips him up and keeps him down. And he <lb/>
            feeds, not on heavenly food, which wisdom offers to contem­ <lb/>
            plative men by means of discourses and opinions ; but on that <lb/>
            which is put forth by the earth in the varying seasons of the <lb/>
            year, from which arise drunkenness and voracity, and licen­ <lb/>
            tiousness, breaking through and inflaming the appetites of the <lb/>
            belly, and enslaving them in subjection to gluttony, by which <lb/>
            they strengthen the impetuous passions, the seat of which is <lb/>
            beneath the belly; and make them break forth. And they <lb/>
            lick up the result of the labours of cooks and tavern-keepers ; <lb/>
            and at times some of them in ecstasy with the flavour of the <lb/>
            delicious food, moves about his head and reaches forward, being <lb/>
            desirous to participate in the sight. And when he sees an ex­ <lb/>
            pensively furnished table, he throws himself bodily upon the <lb/>
            delicacies which are abundantly prepared, and devotes himself <lb/>
            to them, wishing to be filled with them all together, and so to <lb/>
            depart, having no other end in view than that he should allow <lb/>
            nothing of such a sumptuous preparation to be wasted. Owing <lb/>
            to which conduct, he too, carries about poison in his teeth, no <lb/>
            less than the serpent does ; for his teeth are the ministers <lb/>
            and servants of his insatiability, cutting up and smoothing <lb/>
            everything which has a reference to eating, and committing <lb/>
             <pb n="48"/>
            them, in the first place to the tongue, which decides upon, and <lb/>
            distinguishes between the various flavours, and, subsequently, <lb/>
            to the larynx. But immoderate indulgence in eating is natu­ <lb/>
            rally a poisonous and deadly habit, inasmuch as what is so <lb/>
            devoured is not capable of digestion, in consequence of the <lb/>
            quantity of additional food which is heaped in on the top of it, <lb/>
            and arrives before what was previously eaten is converted into <lb/>
            juice.</p>
          <p>And the serpent is said to have uttered a human voice, <lb/>
            because pleasure employs innumerable champions and de­ <lb/>
            fenders who take care to advocate its interests, and who dare <lb/>
            to assert that the power over everything, both small and great, <lb/>
            does of right belong to it without any exception whatever.</p>
          <p>LVII. Now, the first approaches of the male to the female <lb/>
            have a pleasure in them which brings on other pleasures also, <lb/>
            and it is through this pleasure that the formation and genera­ <lb/>
            tion of children is carried on. And what is generated by it <lb/>
            appears to be attached to nothing rather than to it, since they <lb/>
            rejoice in pleasure, and are impatient at pain, which is its con­ <lb/>
            trary. On which account even the infant when first brought <lb/>
            forth cries, being as it seems in pain at the cold. For coming <lb/>
            forth on a sudden into the air from a very warm, and indeed, <lb/>
            hot region-namely, the womb, in which it has been abiding a <lb/>
            considerable time, the air being a cold place and one to which <lb/>
            it is wholly unaccustomed, it is alarmed, and pours forth tears <lb/>
            as the most evident proof of its grief and of its impatience at <lb/>
            pain. For every animal, it is said, hastens to pleasure as to <lb/>
            the cud which is most indispensable and necessary to its very <lb/>
            existence ; and, above all other animals, this is the case with <lb/>
            mail. For other animals pursue pleasure only in taste and in <lb/>
            the acts of generation; but man aims at it by means of his <lb/>
            other senses also, devoting himself to whatever sights or <lb/>
            sounds can impart pleasure to his eyes or ears. And many <lb/>
            other things are said in the way of praise of this inclination, <lb/>
            especially that it is one most peculiar and kindred to all animals.</p>
          <p>LVIII. But what has been already said is sufficient to show <lb/>
            what the reasons were on account of which the serpent appears <lb/>
            to have uttered a human voice And it is on this account that <lb/>
            Moses appears to me in the particular laws also which be issued <lb/>
            in the respect to animals, deciding what were proper to be,eaten, <lb/>
            and what were not, to have given especial praise to the animal <lb/>
             <pb n="49"/>
            called the serpent fighter. This is a reptile with jointed legs <lb/>
            above its feet, by which it is able to leap and to raise itself on <lb/>
            high, in the same manner as the tribe of locusts. For the <lb/>
            serpent fighter appears to me to be no other than temperance <lb/>
            expressed under a symbolical figure, waging an interminable <lb/>
            and unrelenting warfare against intemperance and pleasure. <lb/>
            For temperance especially embraces economy and frugality, <lb/>
            and pares down the necessities to a small number, preferring <lb/>
            a life of austerity and dignity. But intemperance is devoted <lb/>
            to extravagance and superfluity, which are the causes of luxury <lb/>
            and effeminacy to both soul and body, and to which it is owirg <lb/>
            that in the opinion of wise men life is but a faulty thing, and <lb/>
            more miserable than death.</p>
          <p>LIX. But its juggleries and deceits pleasure does not ven­ <lb/>
            ture to bring directly to the man, but first offers them to the <lb/>
            woman, and by her means to. the man; acting in a very natu­ <lb/>
            ral and sagacious manner. For in human beings the mind <lb/>
            occupies the rank of the man, and the sensations that of the <lb/>
            woman. And pleasure joins itself to and associates itself with <lb/>
            the sensations first of all, and then by their means cajoles also <lb/>
            the mind, which is the dominant part. For, after each of the <lb/>
            senses have been subjected to the charms of pleasure, and has <lb/>
            learnt to delight in what is offered to it, the sight being fasci- <lb/>
            Hated by varieties of colours and shapes, the hearing by liar­ <lb/>
            monious sounds, the taste by the sweetness of flowers, and <lb/>
            the smell by the delicious fragrance of the odours which are <lb/>
            brought before it, these all having received these offerings, like <lb/>
            handmaids, bring them to the mind as their master, leading <lb/>
            with them persuasion as an advocate, to warn it against reject­ <lb/>
            ing any of them whatever. And the mind being immediately <lb/>
            caught by the bait, becomes a subject instead of a ruler, and a <lb/>
            slave instead of a master, and an exile instead of a citizen, and <lb/>
            a mortal instead of an immortal. For we must altogether not <lb/>
            be ignorant that pleasure, being like a courtesan or mistress, is <lb/>
            eager to meet with a lover, and seeks for panders in order by <lb/>
            their means to catch a lover. And the sensations are her <lb/>
            panders, and conciliate love to her, and she employing them as <lb/>
            baits, easily brings the mind into subjection to her. And the <lb/>
            sensations conveying within the mind the things which have <lb/>
            been seen externally, explain and display the forms of each of <lb/>
            them, setting their seal upon a similar affection. For the <note type="footnote"> E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="50"/>
            mind is like wax, and receives the impressions of appearances <lb/>
            through the sensations, by means of which it makes itself <lb/>
            master of the body, which of itself it would not be able to do, <lb/>
            as I have already said.</p>
          <p>LX. And those who have previously become the slaves of <lb/>
            pleasure immediately receive the wages of this miserable and <lb/>
            incurable passion. For the woman having received vehement <lb/>
            pains, partly in her travail, and partly such as are a rapid suc­ <lb/>
            cession of agonies during the other portions of her life, and <lb/>
            especially with reference to the bringing forth and bringing up <lb/>
            of her children, to their diseases and their health, to their <lb/>
            good or evil fortune, to an extent that utterly deprives her of <lb/>
            her freedom and subjects her to the dominion of the man who <lb/>
            is her companion, finds it unavoidable'to obey all his com­ <lb/>
            mands. And the man in his turn endures toils and labours, <lb/>
            and continual sweats, in order to the providing of himself with <lb/>
            necessaries, and he also bears the deprivation of all those <lb/>
            spontaneous good things which the earth was originally taught <lb/>
            to produce without requiring the skill of the farmer, and he is <lb/>
            subjected to a state in which he lives in incessant labour, for <lb/>
            the purpose of seeking for food and means of subsistence, in <lb/>
            order to avoid perishing by hunger.</p>
          <p>For I think that as the sun and the moon do continually <lb/>
            give light, ever since they were originally commanded to do <lb/>
            so at the time of the original creation of the universe, and <lb/>
            as they constantly obey the divine injunction, for the sake <lb/>
            of no other reason but because evil and disobedience are <lb/>
            banished to a distance far from the boundaries of heaven : so <lb/>
            in the same way would the fertile and productive regions of <lb/>
            the earth yield an immense abundance in the various seasons <lb/>
            of the year, without any skill or co-operation on the part of the <lb/>
            husbandman. But at present the ever-flowing fountains of the <lb/>
            graces of God have been checked, from the time when wicked­ <lb/>
            ness began to increase faster than the virtues, in order that <lb/>
            they might not be supplying men who were unworthy to be <lb/>
            benefited by them. Therefore, the race of mankind, if it had <lb/>
            met with strict and befitting justice, must have been utterly <lb/>
            destroyed, because of its ingratitude to God its benefactor and <lb/>
            its Saviour. But God, being merciful by nature, took pity <lb/>
            upon them, and moderated their punishment. And he per­ <lb/>
            mitted the race to continue to exist, but he no longer gave <lb/>
             <pb n="51"/>
            them food as he had done before from ready prepared stores, <lb/>
            lest if they were under the dominion of his evils, satiety and <lb/>
            idleness, they should become unruly and insolent.</p>
          <p>LXI. Such is the life of those who originally were men of <lb/>
            innocence and simplicity, and also of those who have come to <lb/>
            prefer vice to virtue, from whom one ought to keep aloof. And <lb/>
            in his beforementioned account of the creation of the world, <lb/>
            Moses teaches us also many other things, and especially five <lb/>
            most beautiful lessons which are superior to all others. In <lb/>
            the first place, for the sake of convicting the atheists, he <lb/>
            teaches us that the Deity has a real being and existence. Now, <lb/>
            of the atheists, some have only doubted of the existence of <lb/>
            God, stating it to be an uncertain thing ; but others, who are <lb/>
            more audacious, have taken courage, and asserted positively <lb/>
            that there is no such thing ; but this is affirmed only by men <lb/>
            who have darkened the truth with fabulous inventions.</p>
          <p>In the second place he teaches us that God is one; having <lb/>
            reference here to the assertors of the polytheistic doctrine ; <lb/>
            men who do not blush to transfer that worst of evil constitu­ <lb/>
            tions, ochlocracy, from earth to heaven.</p>
          <p>Thirdly, he teaches, as has been already related, that the <lb/>
            world was created; by this lesson refuting those who think <lb/>
            that it is uncreated and eternal, and who thus attribute no <lb/>
            glory to God.</p>
          <p>In the fourth place we learn that the world also which was <lb/>
            thus created is one, since also the Creator is one, and he, <lb/>
            making his creation to resemble himself in its singleness, em­ <lb/>
            ployed all existing essence in the creation of the universe. <lb/>
            For it would not have been complete if it had not been made <lb/>
            and composed of all parts which were likewise whole and com­ <lb/>
            plete. For there are some persons who believe that there are <lb/>
            many worlds, and some who even fancy that they are boundless <lb/>
            in extent, being themselves inexperienced and ignorant of the <lb/>
            truth of those things of which it is desirable to have a correct <lb/>
            knowledge.</p>
          <p>The fifth lesson that Moses teaches us is, that God exerts <lb/>
            his providence for the benefit of the world. For it follows of <lb/>
            necessity that the Creator must always care for that which he <lb/>
            has created, just as parents do also care for their children. <lb/>
            And he who has learnt this not more by hearing it than by his <lb/>
            own understanding, and has impressed on his own soul these <note type="footnote">E 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="52"/>
            marvellous facts which are the subject of so much contention- <lb/>
            namely, that God has a being and existence, and that he who <lb/>
            so exists is really one, and that he has created the world, and <lb/>
            that he has created it one as has been stated, having made it <lb/>
            like to himself in singleness ; and that he exercises a con­ <lb/>
            tinual care for that which he has created will live a happy and <lb/>
            blessed life, stamped with the doctrines of piety and holiness.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. " And the heaven and the earth and all their world <lb/>
            was completed.”* Having previously related the creation of <lb/>
            the mind and of sense, Moses now proceeds to describe the <lb/>
            perfection which was brought about by them both. And he <lb/>
            says that neither the indivisible mind nor the particular sen­ <lb/>
            sations received perfection, but only ideas, one the idea of the <lb/>
            mind, the other of sensation. And, speaking symbolically, he <lb/>
            calls the mind heaven, since the natures which can only be <lb/>
            comprehended by the intellect are in heaven. And sensation <lb/>
            he calls earth, because it is sensation which has obtained a <lb/>
            corporeal and somewhat earthy constitution. The ornaments <lb/>
            of the mind are all the incorporeal things, which are percep­ <lb/>
            tible only by the intellect. Those of sensation are the cor­ <lb/>
            poreal things, and everything in short which is perceptible by <lb/>
            the external senses.</p>
          <p>II. " And on the sixth day God finished his work which he. <lb/>
            had made." It would be a sign of great simplicity to think <lb/>
            that the world was created in six days, or indeed at all in <lb/>
            time; because all time is only the space of days and nights, <lb/>
            and these things the motion of the sun as he passes over the <lb/>
            earth and under the earth does necessarily make. But the <lb/>
            sun is a portion of heaven, so that one must confess that time <note type="footnote">* Genesis ii. 1.</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="53"/>
            is a thing posterior to the world. Therefore it would be cor­ <lb/>
            rectly said that the world was not created in time, but that <lb/>
            time had its existence in consequence of the world. For it is <lb/>
            the motion of the heaven that has displayed the nature of <lb/>
            time.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, Moses says, " God completed his works on <lb/>
            the sixth day," we must understand that he is speaking not of <lb/>
            a number of days, but that he takes six as a perfect number. <lb/>
            Since it is the first number which is equalin its parts, -in the <lb/>
            half, and the third and sixth parts, and since it is produced by <lb/>
            the multiplication of two unequal factors, two and three. And <lb/>
            the numbers two and three exceed the incorporeality which <lb/>
            exists in the unit; because the number two is an image of <lb/>
            matter being divided into two parts and dissected like matter. <lb/>
            And the number three is an image of a solid body, because a <lb/>
            solid can be divided according to a threefold division. Not but <lb/>
            what it is also akin to the motions of organic animals. For <lb/>
            an organic body is naturally capable of motion in six directions, <lb/>
            forward, backwards, upwards, downwards, to the right, and to <lb/>
            the left. And at all events he desires to show that the races <lb/>
            of mortal, and also of all the immortal beings, exist according <lb/>
            to their appropriate numbers ; measuring mortal beings, as I <lb/>
            have said, by the number six, and the blessed and immortal <lb/>
            beings by the number seven. First, therefore, having desisted <lb/>
            from the creation of mortal creatures on the seventh day, he <lb/>
            began the formation of other and more divine beings.</p>
          <p>III. For God never ceases from making something or other; <lb/>
            but, as it is the property of fire to burn, and of snow to chill, so <lb/>
            also it is the property of God to be creating. And much more <lb/>
            so, in proportion as he himself is to all other beings the author <lb/>
            of their working. Therefore the expression, " he caused to <lb/>
            rest," is very appropriately employed here, not " he rested.” , <lb/>
            For he makes things to rest which appear to be producing <lb/>
            others, but which in reality do not effect anything; but he <lb/>
            himself never ceases from creating. On which account Moses <lb/>
            says, " He caused to rest the things which he had begun." <lb/>
            For all the things that are made by our arts when completed <lb/>
            stand still and remain ; but all those which are accomplished <lb/>
            by the knowledge of God are moved at subsequent times. For <lb/>
            their ends are the beginnings of other things ; as, for instance, <lb/>
            the end of day is the beginning of night. And in the same <lb/>
             <pb n="54"/>
            way we must look upon months and years when they come to <lb/>
            an end as the beginning of those which are just about to follow <lb/>
            them. And so the generation of other things which are de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, and the destruction of others which are generated is <lb/>
            completed, so that that is true which is said that- <lb/>
            And nought that is created wholly dies; <lb/>
            But one thing parted and combined with others <lb/>
            Produces a fresh form.</p>
          <p>IV. But nature delights in the number seven. For there <lb/>
            are seven planets, going in continual opposition to the daily <lb/>
            course of the heaven which always proceeds in the same direc­ <lb/>
            tion. And likewise the constellation of the Bear is made up <lb/>
            of seven stars, which constellation is the cause of communica­ <lb/>
            tion and unity among men, and not merely of traffic. Again, <lb/>
            the periodical changes of the moon, take place according to the <lb/>
            number seven, that star having the greatest sympathy with the <lb/>
            things on earth. And the changes which the moon works in <lb/>
            the air, it perfects chiefly in accordance with its own configura­ <lb/>
            tions on each seventh day. At all events, all mortal things, <lb/>
            as I have said before, drawing their more divine nature from <lb/>
            the heaven, are moved in a manner which tends to their pre­ <lb/>
            servation in accordance with this number seven. For who is <lb/>
            there who does not know that those infants who are born at <lb/>
            the end of the seventh month are likely to live, but those who <lb/>
            have taken a longer time, so as to have abided eight months in <lb/>
            the womb, are for the most part abortive births ? And they <lb/>
            say that man is a reasoning being in his first seven years, by <lb/>
            which time he is a competent interpreter of ordinary nouns and <lb/>
            verbs, making himself master of the faculty of speaking. And <lb/>
            in his second period of seven years, he arrives at the perfection <lb/>
            of his nature ; and this perfection is the power of generating <lb/>
            a being like himself ; for at about the age of fourteen we are <lb/>
            able to beget a creature resembling ourselves. Again, the <lb/>
            third period of seven years is the termination of his growth ; <lb/>
            for up to the age of one and twenty years man keeps on in­ <lb/>
            creasing in size, and this time is called by many maturity.</p>
          <p>Again, the irrational portion of the soul is divisible into <lb/>
            seven portions ; - the five senses, and the organ of speech, and <lb/>
            the power of generation. Again, the motions of the body are. <lb/>
            seven; the six organic motions, and the rotatory motion.</p><pb n="55"/>
            
          <p>Also the entrails are seven-the stomach, the heart, the <lb/>
            spleen, the liver, the lungs, and the two kidneys.</p>
          <p>In like manner the limbs of the body amount to an equal <lb/>
            number-the head, the neck, the chest, the two hands, the belly, <lb/>
            the two feet. Also the most important part of the animal, <lb/>
            the face, is divisible according to a sevenfold division-the <lb/>
            two eyes. and the two ears, and as many nostrils, and in the <lb/>
            seventh place, the mouth.</p>
          <p>Again, the secretions are seven — tears, mucus from the <lb/>
            nose, saliva, the generative fluid, the two excremental dis­ <lb/>
            charges, and the sweat that proceeds from every part of the <lb/>
            body.</p>
          <p>Moreover, in diseases the seventh day is the most critical <lb/>
            period-and in women the catamenial purifications extend to <lb/>
            the seventh day.</p>
          <p>V. And the power of this number has extended also to the <lb/>
            most useful of the arts-namely, to grammar. At all events, <lb/>
            in grammar, the most excellent of the elements, and those <lb/>
            which have the most powers, are the seven vowels. And like­ <lb/>
            wise in music, the lyre with seven strings is nearly the best of <lb/>
            all instruments; because the euharmonic principle which is <lb/>
            the most dignified of all the principles of melody, is especially <lb/>
            perceived in connection with it.</p>
          <p>Again, it happens that the tones of the voice are seven-the <lb/>
            acute, the grave, the contracted, the aspirate, the lene, the <lb/>
            long and the short sound The number seven is also the first <lb/>
            number which is compounded of the perfect number, that is to <lb/>
            say of six, and of the unit. And in some sense the numbers <lb/>
            which are below ten are either generated by, or do themselves <lb/>
            generate those numbers which are below ten, and the number <lb/>
            ten itself. But the number seven neither generates any of <lb/>
            the numbers below ten, nor is it generated by any of them. <lb/>
            On which account the Pythagoreans compare this number to <lb/>
            the Goddess always a virgin who was born without a mother,* <lb/>
            because it was not generated by any other, and will not gene­ <lb/>
            rate any other.</p>
          <p>VI. " Accordingly, on the seventh day, God caused to rest <lb/>
            from all his works which he had made.”† Now, the meaning <lb/>
            of this sentence is something of this kind. God ceases from <lb/>
            forming the races of mortal creatures when he begins to create <note type="footnote"> * i. e. Minerva </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 2.. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="56"/>
            the divine races, which are akin to the nature of the number <lb/>
            seven. And the reference which is here contained to their <lb/>
            moral character is of the following nature. When that reason <lb/>
            which is holy in accordance with the number seven has entered <lb/>
            into the soul the number six is then arrested, and all the <lb/>
            mortal things which this number appears to make.</p>
          <p>VII. " And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it." <lb/>
            God blesses the manners which are formed in accordance with <lb/>
            the seventh and divine light, as being truly light, and imme­ <lb/>
            diately declares them holy. For that which is blessed, and <lb/>
            that which is holy, are closely connected with one another. <lb/>
            On this account he says, concerning him who has vowed a <lb/>
            great vow, that " If a sudden change comes over him, and <lb/>
            pollutes his mind, he shall no longer be holy."*</p>
          <p>But the previous days were not taken into the calculation, <lb/>
            as was natural, For those manners which are not holy <lb/>
            are not counted, so that which is blessed is alone holy. <lb/>
            Correctly therefore, did Moses say that " God blessed the <lb/>
            seventh day and hallowed it," because on it he " caused to rest <lb/>
            from all his works which he had begun to make." And this is <lb/>
            the reason why he who lives and conducts himself in accor­ <lb/>
            dance with the seventh and perfect light is blessed and holy, <lb/>
            since it is in accordance with his nature, that the creation <lb/>
            of mortal beings was terminated. For the case is thus: <lb/>
            when the light of virtue, which is brilliant and really divine, <lb/>
            rises up, then the generation of the contrary nature is checked. <lb/>
            And we have shown that God never desists from creating <lb/>
            something, but that when he appears to do so he is only be­ <lb/>
            ginning the creation of something else; as being not only, <lb/>
            the Creator, but also the Father of everything which exists.</p>
          <p>VIII. “This is the book of the generation of heaven and <lb/>
            earth, when they were created."t This is perfect reason, <lb/>
            which is put in motion in accordance with the number seven, <lb/>
            being the beginning of the creation of that mind which was <lb/>
            arranged according to the ideas, and also of the sensation ar­ <lb/>
            ranged according to the ideas, and perceptible only by the in­ <lb/>
            tellect, if one can speak in such a manner. And Moses calls <lb/>
            the word of God a book, in which it is come to pass that the <lb/>
            formations of other things are written down and engraved. <lb/>
            But, lest you should imagine that the Deity does anything ac­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers vi. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="57"/>
            cording to definite periods of time, while you should rather <lb/>
            think that everything done by him is inscrutable in its nature, <lb/>
            uncertain, unknown to, and incomprehensible by the race of <lb/>
            mortal men. Moses adds the words, " when they were cre­ <lb/>
            ated," not defining the time when by any exact limitation, <lb/>
            for what has been made by the Author of all things has no <lb/>
            limitation. And in this way the idea is excluded, that the <lb/>
            universe was created in six days.</p>
          <p>IX. " On which day God created the heaven and the earth, <lb/>
            and every green herb of the field, before it appeared upon the <lb/>
            earth, and all the grass of the field before it sprang up. For <lb/>
            God did not rain upon the earth, and man did not exist to cul­ <lb/>
            tivate the earth." This day Moses has previously called a <lb/>
            book, since at least he describes the generation of both heaven <lb/>
            and earth in each place. For by his most conspicuous <lb/>
            and brillant'word, by one command, God makes both things : <lb/>
            the idea of mind, which, speaking symbolically, he calls <lb/>
            heaven, and the idea of sensation, which by a sign he named <lb/>
            earth. And he likens the idea of mind, and the idea of sen <lb/>
            sation to two fields; for the mind brings forth fruit, which <lb/>
            consists in having intellectual perception; and sensation <lb/>
            brings forth other fruits which consist in perceiving by the <lb/>
            agency of the external senses. And what he says has the <lb/>
            following meaning ;-as there was a previously existing idea <lb/>
            of the particular mind, and also of the indivisible minds to <lb/>
            serve as an archetype and model for either ; and also a pre- <lb/>
            existent idea of particular sensation, being, so to say, a sort <lb/>
            of seal which gave impressions of forms, so before particular <lb/>
            things perceptible only by the intellect had any existence, <lb/>
            there was a pre-existent abstract idea of what was perceptible <lb/>
            only by intellect, by participation in which the other things also <lb/>
            received their names; and before particular objects perceptible <lb/>
            by the.external senses, existed, there was also a generic some­ <lb/>
            thing perceptible by the external senses, in accordance with a <lb/>
            participation in which, the other things perceptible by the <lb/>
            external senses were created.</p>
          <p>By " the green herb of the field," Moses means that portion <lb/>
            of the mind which is perceptible only by intellect. For as in <lb/>
            the field green things spring up and flourish, so also that <lb/>
            which is perceptible only by the intellect is the fruit of the <lb/>
            mind. Therefore, before the particular something percepti­ <lb/>
             <pb n="58"/>
            ble only by intellect existed, God created the general some­ <lb/>
            thing perceptible only by intellect, which also he correctly <lb/>
            denominated the universe. For since the particular something <lb/>
            perceptible only by intellect is incomplete, that is not the <lb/>
            universe; but that which is generic is the universe, as being <lb/>
            complete.</p>
          <p>X. " And all the grass of the field," he proceeds, "before it <lb/>
            sprang up." That is to say, before the particular things per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the external senses sprang up, there existed the <lb/>
            generic something perceptible by the external senses through <lb/>
            the fore-knowledge of the Creator, which he again called “the <lb/>
            universe." And very naturally he likened the things per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the external senses to grass. For as grass is the <lb/>
            food of irrational animals, so also that which is perceptible by <lb/>
            the external senses is assigned to the irrational portion of the <lb/>
            soul. For why, when he has previously mentioned " the green <lb/>
            herb of the field," does he add also " and all the grass," as if <lb/>
            grass were not green at all ? But the truth is, that by the <lb/>
            green herb of the field, he means that which is perceptible by <lb/>
            the intellect only, the budding forth of the mind. But grass <lb/>
            means that which is perceptible by the external senses, that <lb/>
            being likewise the produce of the irrational part of the soul.</p>
          <p>" For God did not rain upon the earth, and man did not <lb/>
            exist to cultivate the earth," speaking in ihe strictest accor­ <lb/>
            dance with natural philosophy. For if God did not shed the <lb/>
            perceptions of things subject to them, like rain upon the <lb/>
            senses, in that case the mind too would not labour nor employ <lb/>
            itself about sensation. For he himself would be unable to <lb/>
            effect anything by himself, unless he were to pour forth, like <lb/>
            rain or dew, colours upon the sight, and sounds upon the <lb/>
            hearing, and flavour on the tastes, and on all the other senses, <lb/>
            the things proper to produce the requisite effects. But when <lb/>
            God begins to rain sensation on the things perceptible by the <lb/>
            external senses, then also the mind is perceived to act like the <lb/>
            cultivator of fertile soil. But the idea of sensation, which he, <lb/>
            speaking figuratively, has called the earth, is in no need of <lb/>
            nourishment. But the nourishment of the senses, are the <lb/>
            particular objects perceptible by the external senses ; and these <lb/>
            objects are bodies. But an idea is a thing different from bodies.</p>
          <p>Before, therefore, there existed any individual compound <lb/>
            substances, God did not rain upon that idea of sensation to which <lb/>
             <pb n="59"/>
            he gave the name of the earth. And that means that he did not <lb/>
            furnish it with any nourishment; for, indeed, it had altogether <lb/>
            no need of any object perceptible by the external senses</p>
          <p>But when Moses says, " And man did not exist to cultivate <lb/>
            the earth," that means that the idea of intellect did not labour <lb/>
            upon the idea of the sensations. For my intellect and yours <lb/>
            work up the sensations by means of things perceptible by the <lb/>
            the external senses : hut the idea of mind as must be the case <lb/>
            while there is no individual body connected with it does not <lb/>
            work upon the idea of sensation. For if it did so work, it <lb/>
            would of course -work by means of objects, perceptible by the <lb/>
            external senses. But there is no such object in ideas.</p>
          <p>XI. " But a fountain went up upon the earth, and watered <lb/>
            all the face of the earth." He here calls the mind the foun­ <lb/>
            tain of the earth, and the sensations he calls the face of the <lb/>
            earth, because there is the most suitable place in the whole <lb/>
            body for them, with reference to their appropriate energies, <lb/>
            a place that nature which foreknows everything, has assigned <lb/>
            to them. And the mind waters the sensations like a fountain, <lb/>
            sending appropriate streams over each.</p>
          <p>See now how all the powers of a living animal depend upon <lb/>
            one another like a chain. For as the mind, and sensations, <lb/>
            and the object perceptible by the external sense are three <lb/>
            different things, the middle term is sensation; and the mind, <lb/>
            and the object perceptible by the external sense, are the two <lb/>
            extremes. But the mind is unable to work ; that is to say, <lb/>
            to energize according to sensation, unless God rains upon and <lb/>
            irrigates the object perceptible by the external senses, nor is <lb/>
            there any advantage from the object perceptible to the ex­ <lb/>
            ternal sense when watered, unless the mind, like a fountain, <lb/>
            extending itself as far as the sensation, puts it in motion when <lb/>
            it is quiet, and leads it on to a comprehension of the subject. <lb/>
            So that the mind, and the object perceptible by the external <lb/>
            senses, are always endeavouring to reciprocate with one <lb/>
            another, the one the being subject to the sensations as a kind of <lb/>
            material would be, and the mind stirring up the sensations to­ <lb/>
            wards the external object, as a workman would do, in order to <lb/>
            create an appetite. For a living animal is superior to that <lb/>
            which is not a living animal in two points, imagination and <lb/>
            appetite. Accordingly, imagination consists in the approach <lb/>
            of the external object striking the mind by means of the sen­ <lb/>
            sations. And appetite is the brother of imagination, according <lb/>
             <pb n="60"/>
            to the intensive power of the mind, which the mind keeps on <lb/>
            the stretch, by means of the sensation, and so touches the sub­ <lb/>
            ject matter, and comes over to it, being eager to arrive at and <lb/>
            comprehend it.</p>
          <p>XII. " And God created man, taking a lump of clay from <lb/>
            the earth, and breathed into his face the breath of life: and <lb/>
            man became a living soul." The races of men are twofold ; <lb/>
            for one is the heavenly man, and the other the earthly man. <lb/>
            Now the heavenly man, as being born in the image of God, <lb/>
            has no participation in any corruptible or earth-like essence. <lb/>
            But the earthly man is made of loose material, which he calls <lb/>
            a lump of clay, On which account he says, not that the <lb/>
            heavenly man was made, but that lie ,was fashioned according <lb/>
            to the image of God; but the earthly man he calls a thing <lb/>
            made, and not begotten by the maker. And we must consider <lb/>
            that the man who was formed of earth, means the mind which <lb/>
            is to be infused into the body, but which has not yet been so <lb/>
            infused. And this mind would be really earthly and corrup­ <lb/>
            tible, if it were not that God had breathed into it the spirit of <lb/>
            genuine life ; for then it " exists," and is no longer made <lb/>
            into a soul ; and its soul is not inactive, and incapable of <lb/>
            proper formation, but a really intellectual and living one. <lb/>
            “ For man," says Moses, “ became a living soul."</p>
          <p>XIII. But some one may ask, why God thought an earth­ <lb/>
            horn mind, which was wholly devoted to the body, worthy of <lb/>
            divine inspiration, and yet did not treat the one made after <lb/>
            his own idea and image in the same manner. In the second <lb/>
            place he may ask, what is the meaning of the expression <lb/>
            " breathed into." And thirdly, why he breathed into his face : <lb/>
            fourthly also, why, since he knew the name of the Spirit when <lb/>
            he says, " And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the <lb/>
            waters,"* he now speaks of breath, and not of the Spirit. <lb/>
            Now in reply to the first question we must say this one thing; <lb/>
            God being very munificent gives his good things to all men, <lb/>
            even to those who are not perfect; inviting them to a partici­ <lb/>
            pation and rivalry in virtue, and at the same time displaying <lb/>
            his abundant riches, and showing that it is sufficient for those <lb/>
            also who will not be greatly benefited by it; and he also <lb/>
            shows this in the most evident manner possible in other cases; <lb/>
            for when he rains on the sea, and when he raises up fountains <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="61"/>
            in desert places, and waters shallow and rough and unproduc­ <lb/>
            tive land, making the rivers to overflow with floods, what else <lb/>
            is he doing but displaying the great abundance of his riches <lb/>
            and of his goodness ? This is the cause why he has created <lb/>
            no soul in such a condition as to be wholly barren of good, <lb/>
            even if the employment of that good be beyond the reach of <lb/>
            some people. We must also give a second reason, which is <lb/>
            this: Moses wished to represent all the actions of the Deity <lb/>
            as just-therefore a man who had not had a real life breathed <lb/>
            into him, but who was ignorant of virtue, when he was chas­ <lb/>
            tised for the sins which he had committed would say that he <lb/>
            was punished unjustly, in that it was only through ignorance <lb/>
            of what was good that he had erred respecting it; and that he <lb/>
            was to blame who had not breathed any proper wisdom into <lb/>
            him; and perhaps he will even say, that he has absolutely <lb/>
            committed no offence whatever; since some people affirm that <lb/>
            actions done involuntarily and in ignorance have not the <lb/>
            nature of offences.</p>
          <p>Now the expression " breathed into" is equivalent to " in­ <lb/>
            spired," or “ gave life to" things inanimate: for let us take <lb/>
            care that we are never filled with such absurdity as to think <lb/>
            that God employs the organs of the mouth or nostrils for the <lb/>
            purpose of breathing into anything; for God is not only de­ <lb/>
            void of peculiar qualities, but he is likewise not of the form of <lb/>
            man, and the use of these words shows some more secret mys <lb/>
            tery of nature ; for there must be three things, that which <lb/>
            breathes in, that which receives what is breathed in, and that <lb/>
            which is breathed in. Now that which breathes in is God, <lb/>
            that which receives what is breathed in is the mind, and that <lb/>
            which is breathed in is the spirit. What then is collected <lb/>
            from these three things ? A union of the three takes place, <lb/>
            through God extending the power, which proceeds from him­ <lb/>
            self through the spirit, which is the middle term, as far as <lb/>
            the subject. Why does he do this, except that we may thus <lb/>
            derive a proper notion of him ? Since how could the soul have <lb/>
            perceived God if he had not inspired it, and touched it accord­ <lb/>
            ing to his power? For human intellect would not have dared <lb/>
            to mount up to such a height as to lay claim to the nature of <lb/>
            God, if God himself had not drawn it up to himself, as far as <lb/>
            it was possible for the mind of man to be drawn up, and if he <lb/>
             <pb n="62"/>
            had not formed it according to those powers which can be <lb/>
            comprehended.</p>
          <p>And God breathed into man's face both physically and <lb/>
            morally. Physically, when he placed the senses in the face: <lb/>
            and this portion of the body above all others is vivified and <lb/>
            inspired ; and morally, in this manner, as the face is the <lb/>
            dominant portion of the body, so also is the mind the domi­ <lb/>
            nant portion of the soul. It is into this alone that God <lb/>
            breathes; but the other parts, the sensations, the power of <lb/>
            speech, and the power of generation, he does not think worthy <lb/>
            of his breath, for they are inferior in power. By what then <lb/>
            were these subordinate parts inspired ? beyond all question by <lb/>
            the mind; for of the qualities which, the mind has received <lb/>
            from God, it gives a share to the irrational portion of the soul, <lb/>
            so that the mind is vivified by God, and the irrational part of <lb/>
            the soul by the mind; for the mind is as it were a god to the <lb/>
            irrational part of the soul, for which reason Moses did not <lb/>
            hesitate to call it " the god of Pharaoh."*</p>
          <p>For of all created things some are created by God, and <lb/>
            through him : some not indeed by God, but yet through him: <lb/>
            and the rest have their existence both by him and through <lb/>
            him.</p>
          <p>At all events Moses as he proceeds says, that God planted <lb/>
            a paradise, and among the best things as made both by God <lb/>
            and through God, is the mind. But the irrational part of the <lb/>
            soul was made indeed by God but not through God, but <lb/>
            through the reasoning power which bears rule and sovereignty <lb/>
            in the soul; and Moses has used the word " breath," not <lb/>
            "spirit," as there is a difference between the two words; <lb/>
            for spirit is conceived of according to strength, and intensity, <lb/>
            and power; but breath is a gentle and moderate kind of breeze <lb/>
            and exhalation; therefore the mind, which was created in <lb/>
            accordance with the image and idea of God, may be justly said <lb/>
            to partake in his spirit, for its reasoning has strength: but <lb/>
            that which is derived from matter is only a partaker in a thin <lb/>
            and very light air, being as it were a sort of exhalation, such <lb/>
            as arises from spices ; for they, although they be preserved <lb/>
            intact, and are not exposed to fire or fumigation, do never­ <lb/>
            theless emit a certain fragrance. <note type="footnote"> 1 Exodus vii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="63"/>
            XIV. " And God planted a paradise in Eden, in the east: <lb/>
            and there he placed the man whom he had formed :" * for he <lb/>
            called that divine and heavenly wisdom by many names ; and <lb/>
            he made it manifest that it had many appellations; for he <lb/>
            called it the beginning, and the image, and the sight of God. <lb/>
            And now he exhibits the wisdom which is conversant about <lb/>
            the things of the earth (as being an imitation of this archetypal <lb/>
            wisdom), in the plantation of this Paradise. For let not such <lb/>
            impiety ever occupy our thoughts as for us to suppose that <lb/>
            God cultivates the land and plants paradises, since if we were <lb/>
            to do so, we should be presently raising the question of why <lb/>
            he does so : for it could not be that he might provide himself <lb/>
            with pleasant places of recreation and pastime, or with amuse­ <lb/>
            ment. Let not such fabulous nonsense ever enter our minds ; <lb/>
            for even the whole world would not be a worthy place or habi­ <lb/>
            tation for God, since he is a place to himself, and he himself <lb/>
            is full of himself, and he himself is sufficient for himself, <lb/>
            filling up and surrounding everything else which is deficient <lb/>
            in any respect, or deserted, or empty ; but he himself is sur­ <lb/>
            rounded by nothing else, as being himself one and the universe.</p>
          <p>God therefore sows and implants terrestrial virtue in the <lb/>
            human race, being an imitation and representation of the <lb/>
            heavenly virtue. For, pitying our race, and seeing that it is <lb/>
            exposed to abundant and innumerable evils, lie firmly planted <lb/>
            terrestrial virtue as an assistant against and warder-off of the <lb/>
            diseases of the soul; being, as I have said before, an imitation <lb/>
            of the heavenly and archetypal wisdom which he calls by <lb/>
            various names.</p>
          <p>Now virtue is called a paradise metaphorically, and the ap­ <lb/>
            propriate place for the paradise is Eden; and this means <lb/>
            luxury : and the most appropriate field for virtue is peace, and <lb/>
            ease, and joy; in which real luxury especially consists. <lb/>
            Moreover, the plantation of this paradise is represented in the <lb/>
            east; for right reason never sets, and is never extinguished, <lb/>
            but it is its nature to be always rising. And as I imagine, <lb/>
            the rising sun fills the darkness of the air with light, so also <lb/>
            does virtue when it has arisen in the soul, irradiate its mist <lb/>
            and dissipate the dense darkness. " And there," says Moses, <lb/>
            " he placed the man whom he had formed :” for God being <lb/>
            good, and having formed our race for virtue, as his work which <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="64"/>
            was most akin to himself, places the mind in virtue, evidently <lb/>
            in order that it, like a good husband, may cultivate and <lb/>
            attend to nothing else except virtue.</p>
          <p>XV. And some one may ask here, why, since it is a pious <lb/>
            action to imitate the works of God, it is forbidden to me to <lb/>
            plant a grove near the altar, and yet God plants a paradise? <lb/>
            For Moses says, " You shall not plant a grove for yourself; <lb/>
            you shall not make for yourself any tree which is near the <lb/>
            altar of the Lord your God.”* What then are we to say? <lb/>
            That it is right for God to plant and to build up the virtues in <lb/>
            the soul. But the selfish and atheistical mind, thinking itself <lb/>
            equal with God while it appears to be doing something, is <lb/>
            found in reality to be rather suffering. And though God sows <lb/>
            and plants good things in the soul, the mind which says, "I <lb/>
            plant," is acting impiously. You shall not plant therefore <lb/>
            where God is planting : but if, 0 mind, you fix plants in the <lb/>
            soul, take care to plant only such trees as bear fruit, and not <lb/>
            a grove ; for in a grove there are trees of a character to bear <lb/>
            cultivation, and also wild trees. But to plant vice, which is <lb/>
            unproductive in the soul, along with cultivated and fertile <lb/>
            virtue, is the act of a double-natured and confused leprosy. If, <lb/>
            however, you bring into the same place things which ought not <lb/>
            to be mingled together, you must separate and disjoin them <lb/>
            from the pure and incorrupt nature which is accustomed to <lb/>
            make blameless offerings to God ; and this is his altar ; for it <lb/>
            is inconsistent with this to say that there is any such thing as <lb/>
            a work of the soul, when all things are referred to God, and <lb/>
            to mingle barren things with those which are productive ; for <lb/>
            this would be faulty : but they are blameless things which are <lb/>
            offered to God. If therefore you transgress any one of these <lb/>
            laws, 0 soul! you will be injuring yourself, not God. On <lb/>
            this account God says, " You shall not plant for yourself:" for <lb/>
            no one works for God, and especially what is evil does not. <lb/>
            And again, Moses adds: "You shall not make for yourself." <lb/>
            And in another place he says, " You shall not make gods of <lb/>
            silver with me, and you shall not make gods of gold <lb/>
            for yourselves." For he who conceives either that God has <lb/>
            any distinctive quality, or that he is not one, or that he is <lb/>
            not uncreated and imperishable, or that he is not unchange­ <lb/>
            able, injures himself and not God. " For you shall not make <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xvi. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="65"/>
            them for yourselves," is what he says. For we must conceive <lb/>
            that God is free from distinctive qualities, and imperishable, <lb/>
            and unchangeable; and he who does not conceive thus of him <lb/>
            is filling his own soul with false and atheistical opinions. Do <lb/>
            you not see that-even though God were to conduct us to virtue, <lb/>
            and though when we had been thus conducted we were to plant <lb/>
            no tree which was barren, but only such as produce fruit, he <lb/>
            would still command us to purify its impurity, that is to say, <lb/>
            the appearing to plant. For he here orders us to cut away <lb/>
            vain opinions; and vain opinions are a thing impure by <lb/>
            nature.</p>
          <p>XVI. "And the man whom he had formed," Moses says, <lb/>
            " God placed in the Paradise,"* for the present only Who, <lb/>
            then, is he in reference to whom he subsequently says that <lb/>
            " The Lord God took the man whom he had formed, and <lb/>
            placed him in the Paradise to cultivate it and to guard it.”† <lb/>
            Must not this man who was created according to the image <lb/>
            and idea of God have been a different man from the other, so <lb/>
            that two men must have been introduced into the Paradise <lb/>
            together, the one a fictitious man, and the other modelled <lb/>
            after the image of God? Therefore, the man modelled after <lb/>
            the idea of God, is perceived not only amid the planting of <lb/>
            the virtues, but, besides this, he is their cultivator and <lb/>
            guardian ; that is to say, he is mindful of the things which he <lb/>
            has heard and practised. But the man who is factitious, <lb/>
            neither cultivates the virtues, nor guards them, but is only <lb/>
            introduced into opinions by the abundant liberality of God, <lb/>
            being on the point of immediately becoming an exile from <lb/>
            virtue. Therefore, he calls that man whom he only places in <lb/>
            Paradise, factitious; but him whom he appoints to be its culti­ <lb/>
            vator and guardian he calls not factitious, but "the man whom <lb/>
            he had made." And him he takes, but the other he casts out. <lb/>
            And him whom he takes he thinks worthy of three things, of <lb/>
            which goodness of nature especially consists: namely, expert­ <lb/>
            ness, perseverance, and memory. Now, expertness is his <lb/>
            position in Paradise ; memory is the guarding and preservation <lb/>
            of holy opinions ; perseverance is the effecting of what is good, <lb/>
            the performance of virtuous actions. But the factitious mind <lb/>
            neither remembers what is good, nor does it, but is only <lb/>
            expert, and nothing more; on which account, after it has been <note type="footnote"> * Gen. ii. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Gen. ii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="66"/>
            placed in Paradise, in a short time afterwards it runs away, <lb/>
            and is cast out.</p>
          <p>XVII. " And God caused to rise out of the earth every <lb/>
            tree which is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the <lb/>
            tree of life he raised in the middle of the Paradise, and also the <lb/>
            tree of the knowledge of good and evil." He here gives a <lb/>
            sketch of the trees of virtue which he plants in the soul. And <lb/>
            these are the particular virtues, and the energies in accordance <lb/>
            with them, and the good and successful actions, and the things <lb/>
            which by the philosophers are called fitting; these are the <lb/>
            plants of the Paradise. Nevertheless, he describes the charac­ <lb/>
            teristics of these same trees, showing that that which is desira­ <lb/>
            ble to be beheld is likewise most excellent to be enjoyed. <lb/>
            For of the arts some are theoretical and not practical, such as <lb/>
            geometry and astronomy. Some, again, are practical and not <lb/>
            theoretical, such as the art of the architect, of the smith, and <lb/>
            all those which are called mechanical arts. But virtue is both <lb/>
            theoretical and practical; for it takes in theory, since the road <lb/>
            which leads to it is philosophy in three of its parts-the <lb/>
            reasoning, and the moral, and the physical part. It also <lb/>
            includes action; for virtue is art conversant about the whole <lb/>
            of life; and in life all actions are exhibited. Still, although it <lb/>
            takes in both theory and practice, nevertheless it is most <lb/>
            excellent in each particular. For the theory of virtue is <lb/>
            thoroughly excellent, and its practice and observation is a <lb/>
            worthy object to contend for. On which account Moses says <lb/>
            that the tree was pleasant to the sight, which is a symbol of <lb/>
            theoretical excellence; and likewise good for food, which is a <lb/>
            token of useful and practical good.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But the tree of life is that most general virtue which <lb/>
            some people call goodness; from which the particular virtues <lb/>
            are derived, and of which they are composed. And it is on <lb/>
            this account that it is placed in the centre of the Paradise; having <lb/>
            the most comprehensive place of all, in order that, like a king, it <lb/>
            may be guarded by the trees on each side of it. But some say <lb/>
            that it is the heart that is meant by the tree of life ; since <lb/>
            that is the cause of life, and since that has its position in the <lb/>
            middle of the body, as being, according to them, the dominant <lb/>
            part of the body. But these men ought to be made aware <lb/>
            that they are expounding a doctrine which has more reference <lb/>
            to medical than to natural science. But we, as has been said <lb/>
             <pb n="67"/>
            before, affirm that by the tree of life is meant the most general <lb/>
            virtue. And of this tree Moses expressly says, that it is placed <lb/>
            in the middle of the paradise ; bnt as to the other tree, that <lb/>
            namely of the knowledge of good and evil, he has not specified <lb/>
            whether it is within or outside of the Paradise ; but after he has <lb/>
            used the following expression, " and the tree of the knowledge <lb/>
            of good and evil," he says no more, not mentioning where it is <lb/>
            placed, in order that any one who is uninitiated in the principles <lb/>
            of natural philosophy, may not be made to marvel at his know­ <lb/>
            ledge.</p>
          <p>What then must we say? That this tree is both in the <lb/>
            Paradise and also out of it. As to its essence, indeed, in it; but as <lb/>
            to its power, out of it. How so ? The dominant portion of us is <lb/>
            capable of receiving everything, and resembles wax, which is <lb/>
            capable of receiving every impression, whether good or bad. <lb/>
            In reference to which fact, that supplanter Jacob makes a <lb/>
            confession where he says, " all these things were made for <lb/>
            me.”* For the unspeakable formations and impressions of all <lb/>
            the things in the universe, are all borne forward into, and <lb/>
            comprehended by the soul, which is only one. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore that receives the impression of perfect virtue, it has become <lb/>
            the tree of life ; but when it has received the impression of <lb/>
            vice, it has then become the tree of the knowledge of good and <lb/>
            evil, and vice and all evil have been banished from the divine <lb/>
            company. Therefore the dominant power which has received <lb/>
            it is in the Paradise according to its essence ; for there is in it <lb/>
            that characteristic of virtue, which is akin to the Paradise. <lb/>
            But again, according to its power it is not in it, because the <lb/>
            form of virtue is inconsistent with the divine operations ; and <lb/>
            what I here say, any one may understand in this manner. At <lb/>
            this moment, the dominant part is in my body, according to <lb/>
            its essence, but according to its power it is in Italy, or Sicily, <lb/>
            when it applies its consideration to those countries, and in <lb/>
            heaven when it is contemplating the heaven. On which <lb/>
            principle it often happens that some persons who are in pro­ <lb/>
            fane places, according to their essence, are in the most sacred <lb/>
            places, thinking of those things which relate to virtue. And <lb/>
            again, others who are in the temples of the gods, are profane <lb/>
            in their minds, from the fact of their minds receiving a change <lb/>
            for the worse, and evil impressions ; so that vice is neither in <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlii. 36. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="68"/>
            the Paradise, nor not in it. For it is possible that it may be <lb/>
            in it according to its essence, but it is not possible that it <lb/>
            should be according to its power.</p>
          <p>XIX. " And a river goes forth out of Eden to water the <lb/>
            Paradise. From thence it is separated into four heads: the <lb/>
            name of the one is Pheison. That is the one which encircles <lb/>
            the whole land of Evilat. There is the country where there <lb/>
            is gold, and the gold of that land is good. There also are the car­ <lb/>
            buncle and the sapphire stone. And the name of the second <lb/>
            river is Gihon; this is that which encircles the whole land of <lb/>
            Ethiopia. And the third river is the Tigris. This is the river <lb/>
            which flows in front of the Assyrians. And the fourth river is <lb/>
            the Euphrates."* In these words Moses intends to sketch <lb/>
            out the particular virtues. And they also are four in number, <lb/>
            prudence, temperance, courage, and justice. Now the greatest <lb/>
            river from which the four branches flow off, is generic virtue, <lb/>
            which we have already called goodness ; and the four branches <lb/>
            are the same number of virtues. Generic virtue, therefore, <lb/>
            derives its beginning from Eden, which is the wisdom of God ; <lb/>
            which rejoices and exults, and triumphs, being delighted at <lb/>
            and honoured on account of nothing else, except its Father, <lb/>
            God. And the four particular virtues, are branches from the <lb/>
            generic virtue, which like a river waters all the good actions of <lb/>
            each, with an abundant stream of benefits.</p>
          <p>Let us examine the expressions of the writer: "A river," <lb/>
            says he, " goes forth out of Eden, to water the Paradise." <lb/>
            This river is generic goodness ; and this issues forth out of <lb/>
            the Eden of the wisdom of God, and that is the word of God. <lb/>
            For it is according to the word of God, that generic virtue was <lb/>
            created. And generic virtue waters the Paradise : that is to <lb/>
            say, it waters the particular virtues. But it does not derive its <lb/>
            beginnings from any principle of locality, but from a principle <lb/>
            of pre-eminence. For each of the virtues is really and truly a <lb/>
            ruler and a queen. And the expression, " is separated," is <lb/>
            equivalent to "is marked off by fixed boundaries ;” since wis­ <lb/>
            dom appoints them settled limits with reference to what is to <lb/>
            be done. Courage with respect to what is to be endured ; <lb/>
            temperance with reference to what is to be chosen; and justice <lb/>
            in respect of what is to be distributed.</p>
          <p>XX.“The name of one river is Pheison. This is that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="69"/>
            river which encircles all the land of Evilat; there is the country <lb/>
            where there is gold. And the gold of that land is good ; there <lb/>
            also are the carbuncle and the sapphire stone." One of the <lb/>
            four virtues is prudence, which Moses here calls Pheison: <lb/>
            because the soul abstains* from, and guards against, acts of <lb/>
            iniquity. And it meanders in a circle, and flows all round the <lb/>
            land of Evilat; that is to say, it preserves a mild, and gentle, <lb/>
            and favourable constitution. And as of all fusible essences, <lb/>
            the most excellent and the most illustrious is gold, so also the <lb/>
            virtue of the soul which enjoys the highest reputation, is <lb/>
            prudence. And when he uses the expression, " that is the <lb/>
            country where there is gold," he is not speaking geographically, <lb/>
            that is, where gold exists, but that is the country in which that <lb/>
            valuable possession exists, brilliant as gold, tried in the fire, <lb/>
            aud valuable, namely, prudence. And this is confessed to be <lb/>
            the most valuable possession of God.</p>
          <p>But with reference to the geographical position of virtue, <lb/>
            there are two personages, each invested with distinctive <lb/>
            qualities. One, the being who has prudence, the other, the <lb/>
            being who exerts it; and these he likens to the carbuncle and <lb/>
            the emerald.</p>
          <p>XXI, " And the name of the second river is Gihon. This <lb/>
            is that which encircles all the land of Ethiopia." Under the <lb/>
            symbol of this river courage is intended. For the name of <lb/>
            Gihon being interpreted means chest, or an animal which <lb/>
            attacks with its horns; each of which interpretations is em­ <lb/>
            blematical of courage. For courage has its abode about the <lb/>
            chest, where also is the seat of the heart, and where man is <lb/>
            prepared to defend himself. For courage is the knowledge of <lb/>
            what is to be withstood, and of what is not to be withstood, <lb/>
            and of what is indifferent. And it encircles and surrounds <lb/>
            Ethiopia, making demonstrations of war against it; and the <lb/>
            name of Ethiopia, being interpreted, means humiliation. And <lb/>
            cowardice is a humiliating thing; but courage is adverse to <lb/>
            humiliation and to cowardice.</p>
          <p>" And the third river is the Tigris ; this is that which flows <lb/>
            in front of Assyria." The third virtue is temperance, which <lb/>
            resolutely opposes that kind of pleasure which appears to be <lb/>
            the directress of human infirmity. For the translation of the <lb/>
            name Assyrians in the Greek tongue is <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὑθύνο</foreign>v<foreign xml:lang="grc">τες</foreign>, (directors). <note type="footnote">* <foreign xml:lang="grc">φεισὼν</foreign>, from <foreign xml:lang="grc">φείδομαι</foreign>, to spare, or abstain from. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="70"/>
            And he has likened desire to a tiger, which is the most un­ <lb/>
            tameable of beasts ; it being desire about which temperance is <lb/>
            conversant.</p>
          <p>XXII. It is worth while therefore to raise the question why <lb/>
            courage has been spoken of as the second virtue, and tempe­ <lb/>
            rance as the third, and prudence as the first; and why Moses <lb/>
            has not also explained the course of action of the other virtues. <lb/>
            Now we must understand that our soul is divided into three <lb/>
            parts, and that it has one portion which is conversant about <lb/>
            reason; another which is subject to passion; and another <lb/>
            which is that in which the desires are conceived. And we <lb/>
            find that the proper place and abode of the reasoning part of <lb/>
            the soul, is the head ; of the passionate part, the chest; and of <lb/>
            the part in which the desires are conceived, the stomach. <lb/>
            And we find that appropriate virtues are adapted to each of <lb/>
            these parts. To the rational part, prudence ; in it is the office <lb/>
            of reason, to have a knowledge of what one might, and of what <lb/>
            one ought not to do, And the virtue of the passionate part of <lb/>
            the soul is courage : and of the appetitive part, temperance. <lb/>
            For it is through temperance that we remedy and cure the <lb/>
            appetites. For as the head is the principle and uppermost <lb/>
            part of the animal, and the chest the next highest, and the <lb/>
            liver the third, in point both of importance and of position ; so <lb/>
            in the soul again, the first is the rational part, the second <lb/>
            the passionate part, and the third the appetitive part. In the <lb/>
            same way again of the virtues; the first is that which is con­ <lb/>
            versant about the first portion of the soul, which is the reason­ <lb/>
            ing portion, and which at the same time has its abode in the <lb/>
            head of the body; in short it is prudence. And the second <lb/>
            of the virtues is courage, because it is conversant about the <lb/>
            second portion of the soul, namely, about passion, and has its <lb/>
            abode in the second portion of the body, namely, in the chest. <lb/>
            And the third virtue is temperance, which is placed in the <lb/>
            stomach which is the third portion of the body, and it <lb/>
            is conversant about the appetitive part, which has been <lb/>
            allotted the third part of the soul, as being its subject <lb/>
            matter.</p>
          <p>XXIII. " And the fourth river,” continues Moses, "is the <lb/>
            river Euphrates." And this name Euphrates means fertility ; <lb/>
            and symbolically taken, it is the fourth virtue, namely, justice, <lb/>
            which is most truly a productive virtue, and one which gladdens <lb/>
             <pb n="71"/>
            the intellect. When therefore does this happen ? When the <lb/>
            the three parts of the soul are all in harmony with one another ; <lb/>
            and harmony among them is in reality the predominance of <lb/>
            the most important; as for instance, when the two inferior <lb/>
            parts, the passionate and the appetitive part, are disposed to <lb/>
            yield to the superior part, then justice exists. For it is just <lb/>
            that the better portion should rule at all times, and in all places, <lb/>
            and that the inferior part should be ruled. Now the rational <lb/>
            part is the better part, and the appetitive and the passionate <lb/>
            parts are the inferior ones. But when, on the contrary, passion <lb/>
            and appetite get riotous and disobey the reins, and by the <lb/>
            violence of their impetuosity throw off and disregard the cha <lb/>
            rioteer, that is to say reason, and when each of these passions <lb/>
            get hold of the reins themselves, then there is injustice For <lb/>
            it is inevitable, that through any ignorance or vice of the cha­ <lb/>
            rioteer, the chariot must be borne down over precipices, and <lb/>
            must fall into the abyss ; just as it must be saved when the <lb/>
            charioteer is endowed with skill and virtue.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Again, let us look at the subject in this way also. <lb/>
            Pheison, being interpreted, is the change of the mouth ; and <lb/>
            Evilat means bringing forth, and by these two names prudence <lb/>
            is signified. For people in general think a man prudent who <lb/>
            is an inventor of sophistical expressions, and clever at explain­ <lb/>
            ing that which he has conceived in the mind. But Moses <lb/>
            considered such an one a man fond of words, but by no means <lb/>
            a prudent man. For in the changing of the mouth, that is to <lb/>
            say of the power of speaking and explaining one's ideas, pru­ <lb/>
            dence is seen. And prudence is not a certain degree of acute­ <lb/>
            ness in speech, but ability which is beheld in deeds and in serious <lb/>
            actions. And prudence surrounds Evilat, which is in travail, <lb/>
            as it were with a wall, in order to besiege it and destroy it. <lb/>
            And " bringing forth," is an especially appropriate name for <lb/>
            folly, because the foolish mind, being always desirous of what <lb/>
            is unattainable, is at all times in travail. When it is desirous <lb/>
            of money it is in labour, also when it thirsts for glory, or when <lb/>
            it is covetous of pleasure, or of any thing else. But, though <lb/>
            always in labour, it never brings forth. For the soul of the <lb/>
            worthless man is not calculated by nature to bring any thing <lb/>
            to perfection which is likely to live. But every thing which it <lb/>
            appears to bring forth is found to be abortive and immature. <lb/>
            " Eating up the half of its flesh, and being like a death of the <lb/>
             <pb n="72"/>
            soul.”* On which account that holy word Aaron entreats the <lb/>
            pious Moses, who was beloved by God, to heal the leprosy of <lb/>
            Miriam, in order that her soul might not be occupied in the <lb/>
            labour of bringing forth evil things. And in consequence he <lb/>
            says: " Let her not become like unto death, as an abortion <lb/>
            proceeding out of the womb of her mother, and let her not <lb/>
            devour the half of her own flesh." t</p>
          <p>XXV. " That," says Moses, " is the country, where there <lb/>
            is gold." He does not say that that is the only place where <lb/>
            there is gold, but simply that is the country where there is <lb/>
            gold. For prudence which he likened to gold, being of a <lb/>
            nature free from deceit, and pure, and tried in the fire, and <lb/>
            thoroughly tested, and honourable, exists there in the wisdom <lb/>
            of God. And being there, it is not a possession of wisdom, <lb/>
            but something belonging to the God who is its creator and <lb/>
            owner, whose work and possession this wisdom likewise is. <lb/>
            "And the gold of that land is good." Is there, then, any other <lb/>
            gold which is not good ? Beyond all doubt; for the nature of <lb/>
            prudence is twofold, there being one prudence general, and <lb/>
            another particular. Therefore, the prudence that is in me, <lb/>
            being particular prudence, is not good; for when I perish that <lb/>
            also will perish together with me; but general or universal <lb/>
            prudence, the abode of which is the wisdom of God and the <lb/>
            house of God, is good ; for it is imperishable itself, and dwells <lb/>
            in an imperishable habitation.</p>
          <p>XXVI. " There also is the carbuncle and the emerald." <lb/>
            The two beings endowed with distinctive qualities, the prudent <lb/>
            man and the man who acts prudently, differ from one another; <lb/>
            one of them existing according to prudence, and the other <lb/>
            acting wisely according to the rules of wisdom. For it is on <lb/>
            account of these two beings thus endowed with distinctive <lb/>
            qualities God implanted prudence and virtue in the earth-born <lb/>
            man. For what would have been the use of it, if there had <lb/>
            been no reasoning powers in existence to receive it, and to <lb/>
            give impressions of its form ? So that virtue is very properly <lb/>
            conjoined with prudence, and the prudent man is rightly joined <lb/>
            with him who displays prudence in his actions; the two being <lb/>
            like two precious stones. And may not they be Judah and <lb/>
            Issachar? For the man who puts in practice the prudence of <lb/>
            God confesses himself to be bound to feel gratitude, and to <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="73"/>
            feel it towards him who has given him what is good without <lb/>
            grudging; and he also does honourable and virtuous actions. <lb/>
            Accordingly Judah is the symbol of a man who makes this <lb/>
            confession " in respect of whom Leah ceased from child-bear­ <lb/>
            ing."* But Issachar is the symbol of the man who does good <lb/>
            actions, " For he put forth t his shoulder to labour and became <lb/>
            a man tilling the earth." With respect to whom Moses says, <lb/>
            hire is in his soul after he has been sown and planted, so that <lb/>
            his labour is not imperfect, but is rather crowned and honoured <lb/>
            with a reward by God.</p>
          <p>And that he is making mention of these things, he shows <lb/>
            when speaking on other subjects; when describing the <lb/>
            garment, which reached to the feet he says, " And thou shalt <lb/>
            weave in it sets of stones in four rows. The row of stones <lb/>
            shall be the sardine stone, the topaz, and the emerald are <lb/>
            the first row." Reuben, Simeon, and Levi are here meant. <lb/>
            " And the second row," he says, " are the carbuncle and the <lb/>
            sapphire.”† And the sapphire is the same as the green stone. <lb/>
            And in the carbuncle was inscribed the name of Judah, for he was <lb/>
            the fourth son : and in the sapphire the name of Issachar. Why <lb/>
            then as he had called the sapphire the green stone, did he not also <lb/>
            speak of the red stone ? Because Judah, as the type of a <lb/>
            disposition inclined to confession, is a being immaterial and <lb/>
            incorporeal. For the very name of confession (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐξομολογήσεως</foreign>) <lb/>
            shows that it is a thing external to (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐϰτὸς</foreign>) himself. For when <lb/>
            the mind is beside itself, and bears itself upwards to God, <lb/>
            as the laughter of Isaac did, then it makes a confession to him <lb/>
            who alone has a real being. But as long as it considers itself <lb/>
            as the cause of something, it is a long way from yielding to <lb/>
            God, and confessing to him. For this very act of confessing <lb/>
            ought to be considered as being the work not of the soul, but <lb/>
            of God who teaches it this feeling of gratitude. Accordingly <lb/>
            Judah, who practises confession, is an immaterial being.</p>
          <p>But Issachar who came forth out of labour is in need of <lb/>
            corporeal matter; since if it were otherwise how could a stu­ <lb/>
            dious man read without his eyes ? And how could any one <lb/>
            hear words exhorting him to any cause, if he were not endowed <lb/>
            with hearing ? And how could he obtain meat and drink <lb/>
            without a belly, and without a wonder working art exercised <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 35. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlix. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxviii. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="74"/>
            towards it ? And it is on this account that he was likened to <lb/>
            a precious stone.</p>
          <p>Moreover the colours of the two are different. For the colour <lb/>
            of a coal when on fire is akin to that of the man who is inclined <lb/>
            to confession: for he is inflamed by gratitude to God, and he <lb/>
            is intoxicated with a certain sober intoxication: but the colour <lb/>
            of the green stone is more appropriate to the man who is still <lb/>
            labouring: for those who are devoted to constant labour are <lb/>
            pale on account of .the wearing nature of toil, and also by <lb/>
            reason of their fear that perhaps they may not attain to such <lb/>
            an end of their wish as is desired in their prayers.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And it is worth while to raise the question why <lb/>
            the two rivers the Pheison and the Gihon encircle certain <lb/>
            countries, the one surrounding Evilat, and the other Ethiopia, <lb/>
            while neither of the other rivers is represented as encompasing <lb/>
            any country. The Tigris is indeed said to flow in front of the <lb/>
            land of the Assyrians, but the Euphrates is not mentioned in <lb/>
            connection with any country whatever. And yet in real truth <lb/>
            the Euphrates does both encircle some countries, and has <lb/>
            several also in front of it. But the truth is that the sacred <lb/>
            writer is here speaking not of the river, but of the correction <lb/>
            of manners. It is necessary therefore to say that prudence <lb/>
            and courage are able to raise a wall and a circle of fortification <lb/>
            against the opposite evils, folly, and cowardice; and to take <lb/>
            them captives: for both of them are powerless and easy to be <lb/>
            taken. For the foolish man is easily to be defeated by the <lb/>
            prudent one ; and the coward falls before the valiant man. But <lb/>
            temperance is unable to surround appetite and pleasure; for <lb/>
            they are formidable adversaries and hard to be subdued. Do <lb/>
            you not see that even the most temperate men are compelled <lb/>
            by the necessities of their mortal body to seek meat and drink; <lb/>
            and it is in those things that the pleasures of the belly have their <lb/>
            existence. We must be content therefore to oppose and con­ <lb/>
            tend with the genus appetite. And it is on this account that <lb/>
            the river Tigris is represented as flowing in front of the <lb/>
            Assyrians, that is to say temperance is in front of or arrayed <lb/>
            against pleasure.</p>
          <p>But justice, according to which the river Euphrates is <lb/>
            represented, neither besieges any one, nor draws lines of <lb/>
            circumvallation round any one, nor opposes any one;—why <lb/>
            so ? Because justice is conversant about the distribution of <lb/>
             <pb n="75"/>
            things according to merit, and does not take the part either <lb/>
            of accuser or of defendant, but acts as a judge. As therefore <lb/>
            a judge does not desire beforehand to defeat any one, nor to <lb/>
            oppose and make war upon any one; but delivers his own <lb/>
            opinion and judges, deciding for the right, so also justice, not <lb/>
            being the adversary of any one, distributes its due to every <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " And the Lord God took the man whom he had <lb/>
            made and placed him in the Paradise, to cultivate and to guard <lb/>
            it." The man whom God made differs from the factitious man, <lb/>
            as I have said before. For the factitious mind is somewhat <lb/>
            earthly; but the created mind is purer and more immaterial, <lb/>
            having no participation in any perishable matter, but having <lb/>
            received a purer and more simple constitution. Accordingly <lb/>
            God takes this pure mind, not permitting it to proceed out of <lb/>
            itself, and after he has taken it, he places it among the virtues <lb/>
            which are firmly rooted and budding well, that it may cultivate <lb/>
            and guard them. For many men who were originally prac­ <lb/>
            tisers of virtue, when they come to the end fall off; but he to <lb/>
            whom God gives lasting knowledge is also endowed by him <lb/>
            with both qualities, namely with the disposition to cultivate <lb/>
            the virtues, and the resolution never to desert them, but always <lb/>
            to minister to and guard every one of them. So Moses here <lb/>
            uses the expression "cultivate" as equivalent to "act," and <lb/>
            the word " guard" instead of " remember."</p>
          <p>XXIX. " And the Lord God commanded Adam, saying, Of <lb/>
            every tree that is in the Paradise thou mayest freely eat; but <lb/>
            of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil ye shall not eat; <lb/>
            but in the day on which ye eat of it ye shall die the death."</p>
          <p>A question may arise here to what kind of Adam he gave <lb/>
            this command and who, this Adam was. For Moses has not <lb/>
            made any mention of him before ; but now is the first time <lb/>
            that he has named him.</p>
          <p>Are w'e then to think that he is desirous to supply you with the <lb/>
            name of the factitious man ? " And he calls him, " continues <lb/>
            Moses, " Earth." For this is the interpretation of the name of <lb/>
            Adam. Accordingly, when you hear the name Adam, you <lb/>
            must think that he is an earthly and perishable being ; for he <lb/>
            is made according to an image, being not earthly but heavenly. <lb/>
            But we must inquire how it was that after he had given names <lb/>
            to all the other animals, he did not give one also to himself. <lb/>
             <pb n="76"/>
            What then are we to say about this ? The mind which is in <lb/>
            each of us is able to comprehend all other things, but has not <lb/>
            the capability of understanding itself. For as the eye sees all <lb/>
            other things, but cannot see itself, so also the mind perceives <lb/>
            the nature of other things but cannot understand itself. For <lb/>
            if it does, let it tell us what it is, or what kind of thing it is, <lb/>
            whether it is a spirit, or blood, or fire, or air, or any other <lb/>
            substance : or even only so much whether it is a substance at <lb/>
            all, or something incorporeal. Are not those men then simple <lb/>
            who speculate on the essence of God ? For how can they who <lb/>
            are ignorant of the nature of the essence of their own soul, <lb/>
            have any accurate knowledge of the soul of the universe ? For <lb/>
            the soul of the universe is according to our definition,—God.</p>
          <p>XXX. It is therefore very natural that Adam, that is to say <lb/>
            the mind, when he was giving names to and displaying his <lb/>
            comprehension of the other animals, did not give a name to <lb/>
            himself, because he was ignorant of himself and of his own <lb/>
            nature. A command indeed is given to man, but not to the man <lb/>
            created according to the image and idea of God ; for that being <lb/>
            is possessed of virtue without any need of exhortation, by his <lb/>
            own instinctive nature, but this other would not have wisdom <lb/>
            if it had not been taught to him : and these three things are <lb/>
            different, command, prohibition, and recommendation. For <lb/>
            prohibition is conversant about errors, and is directed to bad <lb/>
            men, but command is conversant about things rightly done; <lb/>
            recommendation again is addressed to men of intermediate <lb/>
            character, neither bad nor good. For such a one does not sin <lb/>
            so that any one has any need to direct prohibition to him, nor <lb/>
            does he do right in every case in accordance with the injunc­ <lb/>
            tion of right reason. But he is in need of recommendation, <lb/>
            which teaches him to abstain from what is evil, and exhorts <lb/>
            him to aim at what is good. Therefore there is no need of <lb/>
            addressing either command, or prohibition, or recommendation <lb/>
            to the man who is perfect, and made according to the image <lb/>
            of God ; For the perfect man requires none of these things ; <lb/>
            but there is a necessity of addressing both command and <lb/>
            prohibition to the wicked man, and recommendation and <lb/>
            instruction to the ignorant man. Just as the perfect gramma­ <lb/>
            rian or perfect musician has need of no instruction in the <lb/>
            matters which belong to his art, but the man whose theories <lb/>
            on such subjects are imperfect stands in need of certain rules, <lb/>
             <pb n="77"/>
            as it were, which contain in themselves commands and prohi­ <lb/>
            bitions, and he who is only learning the art requires instruction.</p>
          <p>Very naturally, therefore, does God at present address com­ <lb/>
            mands and recommendations to the earthly mind, which is <lb/>
            neither bad nor good, but of an intermediate character. And <lb/>
            recommendation is employed in the two names, in that of the <lb/>
            Lord and of God. For the Lord God commanded that if man <lb/>
            obeyed his recommendations, he should be thought worthy of <lb/>
            receiving benefits from God; but if he rejected his warnings, <lb/>
            he should then be cast out to destruction by the Lord, as his <lb/>
            Master and one who had authority over him. On which <lb/>
            account, when he is driven out of Paradise, Moses repeats the <lb/>
            same names ; for he says, " And the Lord God sent him forth <lb/>
            out of the Paradise of happiness, to till the ground from which <lb/>
            he had been taken."* That, since the Lord had laid his <lb/>
            commands on him as his Master, and God as his Benefactor, <lb/>
            he might now, in both these characters, chastise him for having <lb/>
            disobeyed them ; for thus, by the same power by which he had <lb/>
            exhorted him does he also banish him, now that he is dis­ <lb/>
            obedient.</p>
          <p>XXXI. And the recommendations that he addresses to him are <lb/>
            as follows : "Of every tree that is in the Paradise thou mayest <lb/>
            freely eat."t He exhorts the soul of man to derive advantage <lb/>
            not from one tree alone nor from one single virtue, but from <lb/>
            all the virtues; for eating is a symbol of the nourishment of <lb/>
            the soul, and the soul is nourished by the reception of good <lb/>
            things, and by the doing of praiseworthy actions. And Moses <lb/>
            not only says, " thou mayest eat," but he adds " freely," also ; <lb/>
            that is to say, having ground and prepared your food, not like <lb/>
            an ordinary individual, but like a wrestler, you shall thus <lb/>
            acquire strength and vigour. For the trainers recommend the <lb/>
            wrestlers not to cut up their food by biting large pieces off, but <lb/>
            to masticate it slowly, in order that it may contribute to their <lb/>
            strength ; for I and an athlete are fed in different manners. <lb/>
            For I feed merely for the purpose of living, but the wrestler <lb/>
            feeds for the purpose of acquiring flesh and deriving strength <lb/>
            from it; on which account one of his rules of training and <lb/>
            exercise is to masticate his food. This is the meaning of the <lb/>
            expression, " Thou mayest freely eat."</p>
          <p>Again let us endeavour to give a still more accurate expla­ <note type="footnote">* Genesis in. 23. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="78"/>
            nation of it. To honour one's parents is a nourishing and <lb/>
            cherishing thing. But the good and the wicked honour them <lb/>
            in different manners. For the one does it out of habit, as men <lb/>
            eat who do not eat freely, but who merely eat. When, then, <lb/>
            do they also eat freely ? When having investigated and deve­ <lb/>
            loped the causes of things they form a voluntary judgment that <lb/>
            this is good, and the causes of their eating freely, that is to <lb/>
            say, of their honouring their parents in a proper spirit, is­ <lb/>
            they became our parents; they nourished us; they instructed <lb/>
            us; they have been the causes of all good things to us. <lb/>
            Again, to honour the living God is spoken of symbolically as <lb/>
            to eat. But to eat " freely," is when it is done with a proper <lb/>
            explanation of the whole matter, and a correct assignment of <lb/>
            the causes of it.</p>
          <p>XXXII. " But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil <lb/>
            ye shall not eat." Therefore this tree is not in the Paradise. <lb/>
            For God encourages them to eat of every tree that is in the <lb/>
            Paradise. But when he forbids them to eat of this tree, it is <lb/>
            plain that it is not in the Paradise ; and this is in accordance <lb/>
            with natural philosophy. For it is there in its essence, as I <lb/>
            have said before, and it is not there in its power. For as in <lb/>
            wax there are potentially many seals, but in actual fact only <lb/>
            one which has been carved on it, so also in the soul, which <lb/>
            resembles wax, all impressions whatever are contained poten­ <lb/>
            tially ; but in really one single characteristic which is stamped <lb/>
            upon it has possession of it; until it is effaced by some other <lb/>
            which makes a deeper and more conspicuous impression.</p>
          <p>Again, this, also, may be made the subject of a question. <lb/>
            When God recommends men to eat of every tree in the Para­ <lb/>
            dise, he is addressing his exhortation to one individual: but <lb/>
            when he forbids him to eat of the tree of the knowledge of <lb/>
            good and evil he is speaking to him as to many. For in the <lb/>
            one case be says, “ Thou mayest freely eat of all;" but in the <lb/>
            second instance, " Ye shall not eat;" and " In the day in which <lb/>
            ye shall eat," not thou shalt eat;'' and " Ye shall die," not <lb/>
            “ Thou shalt die." We must, therefore, say this,-that <lb/>
            the first good is rare, imparted to but few; but the evil <lb/>
            is comprehensive. On this account it is a hard matter <lb/>
            to find one single man wise and faithful, but the number <lb/>
            of bad men is beyond all computation. Very appro­ <lb/>
            priately, therefore, God does not address his exhortation to <lb/>
             <pb n="79"/>
            nourish one's self amid the virtues, to one individual, but he <lb/>
            encourages many to abstain from extravagant wickedness; for <lb/>
            innumerable men are addicted to it.</p>
          <p>In the second place, for the due comprehension and adoption <lb/>
            of virtue man requires one thing alone, namely reason. But <lb/>
            the body not only does not co-operate in it at all, but rather <lb/>
            impedes the progress of the reason towards it. For it may be <lb/>
            almost called the peculiar task of wisdom to alienate itself from <lb/>
            the body and from the corporeal appetites. But for the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of evil it is not only necessary for a man to have mind in <lb/>
            some degree, but also senses, and reason, and a body. For <lb/>
            the bad man has need of all these things for the completion of <lb/>
            his own wickedness. Since how will he be able to divulge <lb/>
            the sacred mysteries unless he has the organ of voice? And <lb/>
            how will he be able to indulge in pleasures if he be deprived <lb/>
            of the belly and the organs of sensation? Very properly, <lb/>
            therefore, does Moses address reason alone on the subject of <lb/>
            the acquisition of virtue, for reason is, as I have said before, <lb/>
            the only thing of which there is need for the establishment of <lb/>
            virtue. But for indulgence in vice a man requires many <lb/>
            things—soul, and reason, and the external senses of the body; <lb/>
            for it is through all these organs that vice is exhibited.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Accordingly God says, " In the day in which ye <lb/>
            eat of it ye shall die the death." And yet, though they have <lb/>
            eaten of it, they not only do not die, but they even beget <lb/>
            children, and are the causes of life to other beings besides <lb/>
            themselves. What, then, are we to say? Surely that death <lb/>
            is of two kinds ; the one being the death of the man, the other <lb/>
            the peculiar death of the soul-now the death of the man is the <lb/>
            separation of his soul from his body, but the death of the soul <lb/>
            is the destruction of virtue and the admission of vice ; and con­ <lb/>
            sequently God calls that not merely " to die," but " to die the <lb/>
            death;" showing that he is speaking not of common death, <lb/>
            but of that peculiar and especial death which is the death of <lb/>
            the soul, buried in its passions and in all kinds of evil. And <lb/>
            we may almost say that one kind of death is opposed to the <lb/>
            other kind. For the one is the separation of what was pre­ <lb/>
            viously existing in combination, namely, of body and soul. <lb/>
            But this other death, on the contrary, is a combination of <lb/>
            them both, the inferior one, the body, having the predominance, <lb/>
            and the superior one, the soul, being made subject to it <lb/>
             <pb n="80"/>
            When, therefore, God says, "to die the death," you must <lb/>
            remark that he is speaking of that death which is inflicted as <lb/>
            punishment, and not of that which exists by the original ordi­ <lb/>
            nance of nature. The natural death is that one by which the <lb/>
            soul is separated from the body. But the one which is <lb/>
            inflicted as a punishment, is when the soul dies according to <lb/>
            the life of virtue, and lives only according to the life of vice.</p>
          <p>Well, therefore, did Heraclitus say this, following the doc­ <lb/>
            trine of Moses; for he says, " We are living according to the <lb/>
            death of those men ; and we have died according to their life." <lb/>
            As if he had said, Now, when we are alive, we are so though <lb/>
            our soul is dead and buried in our body, as if in a tomb. <lb/>
            But if it were to die, then our soul would live according to its <lb/>
            proper life, being released from the evil and dead body to <lb/>
            which it is bound.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. " AND the Lord God said, It is not good for man to be <lb/>
            alone : let us make him a help meet for bim." Why, 0 pro­ <lb/>
            phet, is it not good for man to be alone ? Because, says he, <lb/>
            it is good, that he who is alone should be alone. But God is <lb/>
            alone, and by himself, being one; and there is nothing like <lb/>
            unto God. So that, since it is good that he who only has a <lb/>
            real existence should be alone (for that which is about itself <lb/>
            alone is good), it cannot be good for man to be alone. But <lb/>
            the fact of God being alone one may receive in this sense; <lb/>
            that neither before the creation was there anything with God, <lb/>
            nor, since the world has been created, is anything placed in <lb/>
            the same rank with him; for he is in need of absolutely <lb/>
            nothing whatever.</p>
          <p>But the better way of understanding this passage is the fol­ <lb/>
            lowing : God is alone: a single being: not a combination: a <lb/>
            single nature: but each of us, and every other animal in the <lb/>
            world, are compound beings: for instance, I myself am made <lb/>
             <pb n="81"/>
            up of many things, of soul and body. Again, the soul is made <lb/>
            up of a rational part and an irrational part: also of the body, <lb/>
            there is one part hot, another cold ; one heavy, another light; <lb/>
            one dry, another moist. But God is not a compound being, <lb/>
            nor one which is made up of many parts, but one which has <lb/>
            no mixture with anything else; for whatever could be com­ <lb/>
            bined with God must be either superior to him, or inferior to <lb/>
            him, or equal to him. But there is nothing equal to God, <lb/>
            and nothing superior to him, and nothing is combined with <lb/>
            him which is worse than himself; for if it were, he himself <lb/>
            would be deteriorated; and if he were to suffer deterioration, <lb/>
            he would also become perishable, which it is impious even to <lb/>
            imagine. Therefore God exists according to oneness and <lb/>
            unity; or we should rather say, that oneness exists according <lb/>
            to the one God, for all number is more recent than the world, <lb/>
            as is also time. But God is older than the world, and is its <lb/>
            Creator.</p>
          <p>II. But it is not good for any man to be alone. For there <lb/>
            are two kinds of men, the one made according to the image of <lb/>
            God, the other fashioned out of the earth; for it longs for its <lb/>
            own likeness. For the image of God is the antitype of all <lb/>
            other things, and every imitation aims at this of which it is <lb/>
            the imitation, and is placed in the same class with it. And it <lb/>
            is not good for either the man, who was made according to the <lb/>
            image of God, to be alone: nor is it any more desirable for <lb/>
            the factitious man to be alone, and indeed it is impossible. <lb/>
            For the external senses, and the passions, and the vices, and <lb/>
            innumerable other things, are combined with and adapted to <lb/>
            the mind of this man. But the second kind of man has a <lb/>
            help-meet for him, who, in the first place, is created; " For I <lb/>
            will make him," says God, " a help-meet for him." And, in <lb/>
            the second place, is younger than the object to be helped; for, <lb/>
            first of all, God created the mind, and subsequently he pre­ <lb/>
            pares to make its helper. But all this is spoken allegorically, <lb/>
            in accordance with the principles of natural philosophy; for <lb/>
            external sensation and the passions of the soul are all <lb/>
            younger than the soul, and how they help it we shall see <lb/>
            hereafter, but at present we will consider the fact of their <lb/>
            being helpers younger than the object helped.</p>
          <p>III. As, according to the most skilful physicians and na­ <lb/>
            tural philosophers, the heart appears to be formed before the <note type="footnote">G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="82"/>
            rest of the body, after the manner of the foundation of a <lb/>
            house or the keel of a ship, aud then the rest of the body is <lb/>
            built upon it; on which account, even after death, the phy­ <lb/>
            sicians say, that the heart still quivers, as having been created <lb/>
            before the rest of the body, and being destroyed after it; so <lb/>
            also does the dominant portion of the soul appear to be older <lb/>
            than the whole of the soul, and the irrational part to be <lb/>
            younger; the formation of which Moses has not yet men­ <lb/>
            tioned, but he is about to give a sketch of it, how the <lb/>
            irrational part of the soul is the external sensation, and the <lb/>
            passions which spring from it, especially if the judgments are <lb/>
            our own. And this assistant of God is younger, aud created, <lb/>
            being thus described with perfect propriety.</p>
          <p>But now let us see how that part, which was postponed be­ <lb/>
            fore, acts as an assistant: how does our mind comprehend <lb/>
            that such and such a thing is black or white, unless it employs <lb/>
            sight as its assistant? and how does it know that the voice of <lb/>
            the man who is singing to his harp is sweet, or, on the con­ <lb/>
            trary, out of tune, if it has not the assistance of the faculty of, <lb/>
            hearing to guide it ? And how can it tell that exhalations are <lb/>
            fragrant or foul-smelling, unless it makes use of the sense of <lb/>
            smell as its ally ? How again does it judge of the different <lb/>
            flavours, except through the instrumentality of its assistant, <lb/>
            taste ? How can it distinguish between what is rough and <lb/>
            what is smooth, except by touch ? There is also another class <lb/>
            of assistants, as I have already said, namely, the passions: <lb/>
            for pleasure also is an assistant, co-operating towards the dura­ <lb/>
            bility of our race, and in like manner coucupiscence, and pain, <lb/>
            and fear, biting the soul, lead it to treat nothing with indif. <lb/>
            ference. Anger, again, is a defensive weapon, which has been <lb/>
            of great service to many people, and so too have the other <lb/>
            passions in the same manner. On which account Moses has <lb/>
            said, with great felicity, “ that he was an assistant to him­ <lb/>
            self:" for he is in reality an assistaut to the mind, as if he <lb/>
            were its brother and near kinsman : for the external sensations <lb/>
            and the passions are parts of one soul, and are its offspring.</p>
          <p>IV. Now of assistants there are two kinds, the one consist­ <lb/>
            ing in the passions and the other in the sensations.... * <note type="footnote"> * A word or two are lost here. Pfeiffer thinks that several sentences <lb/>
            are wanting; and there is a great want of connection between what <lb/>
            follows and what has gone before. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="83"/>
            But the prior kind is that of generation, for Moses says, <lb/>
            " And God proceeded and made all the beasts of the field out <lb/>
            of the earth, and all the birds of heaven; and he brought <lb/>
            them to Adam to see what he would call them, and whatever <lb/>
            Adam called any living soul that became its name." You see <lb/>
            here who are our assistants, the beasts of the soul, the <lb/>
            passions. For after God had said, " I will make him a help- <lb/>
            meet for him," Moses adds subsequently, " He made the <lb/>
            beasts," as if the beasts also were assistants to us. But these <lb/>
            are not, properly speaking, assistants, but are called so only <lb/>
            in a catachrestic manner, by a kind of abuse of language, for <lb/>
            they are found in reality to be enemies to man. As also in <lb/>
            the case of cities, the allies turn out at times to be traitors <lb/>
            and deserters; and in the case of friendship, flatterers are <lb/>
            found to be enemies instead of companions; and Moses here <lb/>
            speaks of the heaven and the field synonymously, describing <lb/>
            the mind in this allegorical manner; for the mind, like the <lb/>
            field, has innumerable periods of rising and budding forth; <lb/>
            and, like the heaven, has brilliant, and divine, and happy <lb/>
            characteristics of nature.</p>
          <p>But the passions he compares to beasts and birds, because <lb/>
            they injure the mind, being untamed and wild, and because, <lb/>
            after the manner of birds, they descend upon the intellect; <lb/>
            for their onset is swift and difficult to withstand; and the <lb/>
            word " besides," as attached to " he made," is not super­ <lb/>
            fluous. Why so? because he has previously said, that the <lb/>
            beasts were formed before the creation of man, and he shows <lb/>
            it in the following words, which are an account of what was <lb/>
            done on the sixth day.</p>
          <p>" And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures <lb/>
            after their kind, four-footed animals, and creeping things, and <lb/>
            wild beasts." Why, then, is it that he makes other animals <lb/>
            now, not being content with those already existing? now <lb/>
            this must be stated according to the principles of moral phi­ <lb/>
            losophy. The species of evil are abundant in created man, so <lb/>
            that the most evil things are continually produced in him; <lb/>
            and this other thing must be affirmed on principles of natural <lb/>
            philosophy. First of all, in the six days he created the differ­ <lb/>
            ent kinds of passions, and the ideas, but now, in addition to <lb/>
            them, he is creating the species. On which account Moses <lb/>
            says, " And besides he made . . .” and that what had been <note type="footnote"> G 2 </note> <lb/>

            previously created were genera is plain from what he says, <lb/>
            “ Let the earth bring forth living souls," not according to <lb/>
            species but according to genus. And this is found to be the <lb/>
            course taken by God in all cases; for before making the spe­ <lb/>
            cies he completes the genera, as he did in the case of man: <lb/>
            for having first modelled the generic man, in whom they say <lb/>
            that the male and female sexes are contained, he afterwards <lb/>
            created the specific man Adam.</p>
          <p>V. This therefore he denominated the species of assistants, <lb/>
            but the other part of the creation, the description, that is, of <lb/>
            the formation of the external sensations, was postponed till he <lb/>
            began to form the woman; and having put off this he then <lb/>
            gives an account of the distribution of names; and this is au <lb/>
            explanation, partly figurative and partly literal, which is <lb/>
            worthy of our admiration. It is literal, inasmuch as the Law­ <lb/>
            giver has attributed the imposition of names to the first-born <lb/>
            man ; for those also among the Greeks, who study philosophy, <lb/>
            say that they were wise men who first gave names to things : <lb/>
            but Moses speaks more correctly in the first place, because he <lb/>
            attributes this giving of names, not to some of those men who <lb/>
            lived in early times, but to the first man who was created <lb/>
            upon the earth ; so that, just as he himself was created to be <lb/>
            the beginning of creation to all other animals, he might also <lb/>
            be considered the beginning of conversation and language: <lb/>
            for if there were no such things as names there could be no <lb/>
            such thing as language: and, secondly, because, if many dif­ <lb/>
            ferent persons gave names, they must have been different and <lb/>
            devoid of all connexion, since different persons would have <lb/>
            given different names : but if only one person did so, the name <lb/>
            given by one was sure to be adapted to the thing: and the <lb/>
            same name was likely to be a token to every one of the exist­ <lb/>
            ing things signified by it.</p>
          <p>VI. But the moral meaning of this passage is as follows :— <lb/>
            We often use the expression <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign> instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια τί</foreign>; (why ?) as <lb/>
            when we say, why (n) have you washed yourself? why (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign>) <lb/>
            are you walking? why (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign>) are you conversing? for in all <lb/>
            these cases <foreign xml:lang="grc">τί</foreign> is used instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια τί</foreign>; when therefore Moses <lb/>
            says, " to see what he would call them," you must understand <lb/>
            him as if he had said <foreign xml:lang="grc">δια τί</foreign> (why), instead of ri (what): and <lb/>
            the mind will invite and embrace each of these meanings. <lb/>
            Is it then only for the sake of what is necessary that the mor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="85"/>
            tal race is of necessity implicated in passions and vices ? or is <lb/>
            it also on account of that which is immoderate and super­ <lb/>
            fluous? And again, is it because of the requirements of the <lb/>
            earth-born mali, or because the mind judges them to be most <lb/>
            excellent and admirable things; as for instance, is it necessary <lb/>
            for every created thing to enjoy pleasure ? But the bad man <lb/>
            flies to pleasure as to a perfect good, but the good man seeks <lb/>
            it only as a necessary; for without pleasure nothing whatever <lb/>
            is done among the human race.</p>
          <p>Again, the bad mail considers the acquisition of riches as <lb/>
            the most perfect good possible; but the good man looks upon <lb/>
            riches only as a necessary and useful thing. Very naturally, <lb/>
            therefore, God desires to see and to learn how the mind de­ <lb/>
            nominates and appreciates each of these things, whether it <lb/>
            looks upon them as good, or as things indifferent, or as evil in <lb/>
            themselves, but nevertheless in some respects necessary. On <lb/>
            which account, thinking that everything which he invited <lb/>
            towards himself, and embraced as a living soul, was of equal <lb/>
            value and importance with the soul, this became the name, <lb/>
            not only of the thing which was thus invited, but also of him <lb/>
            who invited it: as for instance, if the man embraced pleasure, <lb/>
            he was called a man devoted to pleasure; if he embraced ap­ <lb/>
            petite, he was called a man of appetite; if he invited intem­ <lb/>
            perance, he himself also acquired the name of intemperate; <lb/>
            if he admitted cowardice, he was called cowardly; and so on in <lb/>
            the case of the other passions. For as he who has any dis­ <lb/>
            tinctive qualities according to the virtues, is called from that <lb/>
            virtue with which he is especially endowed, prudent, or <lb/>
            temperate, or just, or courageous, as the case may be; so too <lb/>
            in respect of the vices, a man is called unjust, or foolish, or <lb/>
            unmanly, when he has invited and embraced these habits of <lb/>
            mind and conduct.</p>
          <p>VII. " And God cast a deep trance upon Adam, and sent <lb/>
            him to sleep; and he took one of his ribs," and so on. The <lb/>
            literal statement conveyed in these words is a fabulous one ; <lb/>
            for how can any one believe that a woman was made of a rib <lb/>
            of a man, or, in short, that any human being was made out of <lb/>
            another? And what hindered God, as he had made man out <lb/>
            of the earth, from making woman in the same manner? For <lb/>
            the Creator was the same, and the material was almost inter­ <lb/>
            minable, from which every distinctive quality whatever was <lb/>
             <pb n="86"/>
            made. And why, when there were so many parts of a man, <lb/>
            did not God make the woman out of some other part rather <lb/>
            than out of one of his ribs ? Again, of which rib did he make <lb/>
            her? And this question would hold even if we were to say, <lb/>
            that he had only spoken of two ribs; but in truth he has not <lb/>
            specified their number. Was it then the right rib, or the left <lb/>
            rib ? Again, if he filled up the place of the other with flesh, <lb/>
            was not the one which he left also made of flesh ? and indeed <lb/>
            our ribs are like sisters, and akin in all their parts, and they <lb/>
            consist of flesh. What then are we to say ? ordinary custom <lb/>
            calls the ribs the strength of a man; for we say that a man <lb/>
            has ribs, which is equivalent to saying that he has vigour; and <lb/>
            we say that a wrestler is a man with strong ribs, when we <lb/>
            mean to express that he is strong: and we say that a harp­ <lb/>
            player has ribs, instead of saying that he has energy and power <lb/>
            in his singing.</p>
          <p>Now that this has been premised we must also say, that <lb/>
            the mind, while naked and free from the entanglement of the <lb/>
            body (for our present discussion is about the mind, while it is <lb/>
            as yet entangled in nothing) has many powers, namely, the <lb/>
            possessive power, the progenitive power, the power of the soul, <lb/>
            the power of reason, the power of comprehension, and part of <lb/>
            others innumerable both in their genus and species. Now <lb/>
            the possessive power is common to it with other inanimate <lb/>
            things, with stocks and stones, and it is shared by the things <lb/>
            in us, which are like stones, namely, by our bones. And <lb/>
            natural power extends also over plants: and there are parts in <lb/>
            us which have some resemblance to plants, namely, our nails <lb/>
            and our hair: and nature is a habit already put in motion, but <lb/>
            the soul is a habit which has taken to itself, in addition, imagi­ <lb/>
            nation and impetuosity; and this power also is possessed by <lb/>
            man in common with the irrational animals; and our mind <lb/>
            has something analogous to the soul of an irrational animal.</p>
          <p>• Again, the power of comprehension is a peculiar property <lb/>
            of the mind; and the reasoning power is perhaps common to <lb/>
            the more divine natures, but is especially the property of the <lb/>
            mortal nature of man : and this is a twofold power, one kind <lb/>
            being that in accordance with which we are rational creatures, <lb/>
            partaking of mind; and the other kind being that faculty by <lb/>
            which we converse.</p>
          <p>There is also another power in the soul akin to these, the <lb/>
             <pb n="87"/>
            power of sensation, of which we are now speaking; for Moses <lb/>
            is describing nothing else on this occasion except the form­ <lb/>
            ation of the external sense, according to energy and according <lb/>
            to reason.</p>
          <p>VIII. For immediately after the creation of the mind it <lb/>
            was necessary that the external sense should be created, as an <lb/>
            assistant and ally of the mind ; therefore God having entirely <lb/>
            perfected the first, proceeded to make the second, both in <lb/>
            rank and power, being a certain created form, an external <lb/>
            sense according to energy, created for the perfection and com­ <lb/>
            pletion of the whole soul, and for the proper comprehension of <lb/>
            such subject matter as might be brought before it. How then <lb/>
            was this second thing created? As Moses himself says in a <lb/>
            subsequent passage, when the mind was gone to sleep: for, in <lb/>
            real fact, the external sense then comes forward when the <lb/>
            mind is asleep. And again, when the mind is awake the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense is extinguished; and the proof of this is, that <lb/>
            when we desire to form an accurate conception of anything, <lb/>
            we retreat to a desert place, we shut our eyes, we stop up our <lb/>
            ears, we discard the exercise of our senses; and so, when the <lb/>
            mind rises up again and awakens, the outward sense is put <lb/>
            an end to.</p>
          <p>Let us now consider another point, namely, how the mind <lb/>
            goes to sleep: for when the outward sense is awakened and <lb/>
            has become excited, when the sight beholds any works of <lb/>
            painting or of sculpture beautifully wrought, is not the mind <lb/>
            then without anything on which to exercise its functions, con­ <lb/>
            templating nothing which is a proper subject for the intellect ? <lb/>
            What more? When the faculty of hearing is attending to <lb/>
            some melodious combination of sound, can the mind turn <lb/>
            itself to the contemplation of its proper objects ? by no means. <lb/>
            And it is much more destitute of occupation, when taste rises <lb/>
            up and eagerly devotes itself to the pleasures of the belly; on <lb/>
            which account Moses, being alarmed lest some day or other <lb/>
            the mind might not merely go to sleep, but might become ab­ <lb/>
            solutely dead, says in another place, " And it shall be to you <lb/>
            a peg in your girdle; and it shall be, that when you sit <lb/>
            down you shall dig in it, and, heaping up earth, shall cover <lb/>
            your shame.”*Speaking symbolically, and giving the name of <lb/>
            peg to reason which digs up secret affairs; and he bids him to <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxiii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="88"/>
            bear it upon the affection with which he ought to be girded, <lb/>
            and not to allow it to slacken and become loosened; and this <lb/>
            must be done when the mind. departing from the intense con­ <lb/>
            sideration of objects perceptible by the intellect, is brought <lb/>
            down to the passions, and sits down, yielding to, and being <lb/>
            guided by, the necessities of the body: and this is the case <lb/>
            when the mind, being absorbed in luxurious associations, for­ <lb/>
            gets itself, being subdued by the things which conduct it to <lb/>
            pleasure, and so we become enslaved, and yield ourselves up <lb/>
            to unconcealed impurity.</p>
          <p>But if reason be able to purify the passion, then neither <lb/>
            when we drink do we become intoxicated, nor when we eat do <lb/>
            we become indolent through satiety, but we feast soberly with­ <lb/>
            out indulging in folly. Therefore, the awakening of the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses is the sleep of the mind; and the awakening of <lb/>
            the mind is the discharge of the outward senses from all occu­ <lb/>
            pation. Just as when the sun arises the brightness of all the <lb/>
            rest of the stars becomes invisible; but when the sun sets, <lb/>
            they are seen. And so, like the sun, the mind, when it is <lb/>
            awakened, overshadows the outward senses, but when it goes to <lb/>
            sleep it permits them to shine.</p>
          <p>IX. After this preface we must now proceed to explain the <lb/>
            words : " The Lord God," says Moses, " cast a deep trance <lb/>
            upon Adam, and sent him to sleep." He speaks here with <lb/>
            great correctness, for a trance and perversion of the mind is <lb/>
            its sleep. And the mind is rendered beside itself when it <lb/>
            ceases to be occupied about the things perceptible only by the <lb/>
            intellect which present themselves to it. And when it is not <lb/>
            energizing with respect to them it is asleep. And the expres­ <lb/>
            sion, “ it is in a trance," is very well employed, as it means <lb/>
            that it is perverted and changed, not by itself, but by God, <lb/>
            who presents to it, and brings before it, and sends upon it <lb/>
            the change which occurs to it. For the case is this :-if it <lb/>
            were in my own power to be changed, then whenever I chose <lb/>
            I should exercise this power, and whenever I did not choose I <lb/>
            should continue as I am, without any change. But now <lb/>
            change attacks me from an opposite direction, and very often <lb/>
            when I am desirous to turn my intellect to some fitting sub­ <lb/>
            ject, I am swallowed up by an influx contrary to what is <lb/>
            fitting; and on the other hand, when I conceive an idea <lb/>
            respecting something unseemly, I discard it by means of <lb/>
             <pb n="89"/>
            pleasant notions while God by his own grace pours into my <lb/>
            soul a sweet stream instead of the salt flood. It is necessary <lb/>
            therefore, that every created thing should at times be changed. <lb/>
            For this is a property of every created thing, just as it is an <lb/>
            attribute of God to be unchangeable. But of these beings who <lb/>
            have been changed, some remain in their altered state till <lb/>
            their final and complete destruction, though others are only <lb/>
            exposed to the ordinary vicissitudes of human nature; and <lb/>
            they are immediately preserved.</p>
          <p>On which account Moses says that " God will not suffer <lb/>
            the destroyer to enter into your houses to smite them."* For <lb/>
            he does permit the destroyer (and change is the destruction of <lb/>
            the soul) to enter into the soul, in order to exhibit the pecu­ <lb/>
            liar characteristic of the created being. But God will not <lb/>
            permit the offspring of the seeing Israel to be changed in such <lb/>
            a manner as to be stricken down by the change; but he will <lb/>
            compel it to emerge and rise up again like one who rises up <lb/>
            from the deep, and so he will cause it to be saved.</p>
          <p>X. " He took one of his ribs." He took one of the many <lb/>
            powers of the mind, namely, that power which dwells in the <lb/>
            outward senses. And when he uses the expression, " He took,' <lb/>
            we are not to understand it as if he had said, " He took away," <lb/>
            but rather as equivalent to “ He counted, He examined ;” as he <lb/>
            says in another place, " Take the chief of the spoils of the <lb/>
            captivity."t What, then, is it which he wishes to show ? Sensa­ <lb/>
            tion is spoken of in a twofold manner ;-the one kind being <lb/>
            according to habit, which exists even when we are asleep, and <lb/>
            the other being according to energy. Now, in the former kind, <lb/>
            the one according to habit, there is no use : for we do not com­ <lb/>
            prehend any one of the objects presented to our view by its <lb/>
            means. But there is use in the second, in that which exists <lb/>
            according to energy; for it is by means of this that we arrive at a <lb/>
            comprehension of the objects perceptible by the outward senses.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, God, having created the former kind of sensa­ <lb/>
            tion, that existing according to habit, when he was creating <lb/>
            the mind (for he was furnishing that with many faculties in a <lb/>
            state of rest), desires now to complete the other kind which <lb/>
            exists according to energy. And this one according to energy <lb/>
            is perfected when the one which exists according to habit is <lb/>
            put in motion, and extended as far as the flesh and the organs <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xii. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxxi. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="90"/>
            of sense. For as nature is perfected when the seed is put in <lb/>
            motion, so, also, energy is perfected when the habit is put in <lb/>
            motion.</p>
          <p>XI. "And he filled the space with flesh instead of it." <lb/>
            That is to say, he filled up that external sense which exists <lb/>
            according to habit, leading it on to energy and extending it as <lb/>
            far as the flesh and the whole outward and visible surface of <lb/>
            the body. In reference to which Moses adds that " he built <lb/>
            it up into a woman:" showing by this expression that woman <lb/>
            is the most natural and felicitously-given name for the exter­ <lb/>
            nal sense. For as the man is seen in action, and the woman <lb/>
            in being the subject of action, so also is the mind seen in <lb/>
            action, and the external sense, like the woman, is discerned by <lb/>
            suffering or being the subject of action. And it is easy to <lb/>
            learn this from the way in which it is affected in practice. <lb/>
            Thus the sight is affected by these objects of sight which put <lb/>
            it in motion, such as white and black, and the other colours. <lb/>
            Again, hearing is affected by sounds, and taste is disposed in <lb/>
            such or such a way by flavours ; the sense of smell by scents ; <lb/>
            and that of touch by hardness or softness. And, on the other <lb/>
            hand all the outward senses are in a state of tranquillity until <lb/>
            each is approached from without by that which is to put it in <lb/>
            motion.</p>
          <p>XII. " And he brought her to Adam. And Adam said, This <lb/>
            is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh." God leads the <lb/>
            external sense, existing according to energy, to the mind ; know­ <lb/>
            ing that its motion and apprehension must turn back to the mind. <lb/>
            But the mind, perceiving the power which it previously had <lb/>
            (and which, while it was existing according to habit was in a <lb/>
            state of tranquillity), now have to become a complete operation <lb/>
            and energy, and to be in a state of motion, marvels at it, and <lb/>
            utters an exclamation, saying that it is not unconnected with <lb/>
            it, but very closely akin to it. For Adam says, " This now is <lb/>
            bone of my bone that is to say, This is power of my power; <lb/>
            for bone is here to be understood as a symbol of strength and <lb/>
            power. And it is, he adds, suffering of my sufferings ; that is <lb/>
            it is flesh of my flesh. For every thing which the external <lb/>
            sense suffers, it endures not without the support of the mind ; <lb/>
            for the mind is its fountain, and the foundation on which it is <lb/>
            supported.</p>
          <p>It is also worth while to consider why Adam adde <lb/>
             <pb n="91"/>
            word "now," for he says, "This now is bone of my bone." <lb/>
            The explanation is, external sensation exists now, having its <lb/>
            existence solely with reference to the present moment. For <lb/>
            the mind touches three separate points of time; for it per­ <lb/>
            ceives present circumstances, and it remembers past events, <lb/>
            and it anticipates the future. But the external sensations <lb/>
            have neither any anticipation of future events, nor are they <lb/>
            subject to any feeling resembling expectation or hope, nor have <lb/>
            they any recollection of past circumstances; but are by <lb/>
            nature capable only of being affected by that which moves <lb/>
            them at the moment, and is actually present. As, for example, <lb/>
            the eye is made white by a white appearance presented to it at <lb/>
            the moment, but it is not affected in any manner by that <lb/>
            which is not present to it. But the mind is agitated also by <lb/>
            that which is not actually present, but which may be past; in <lb/>
            which case it is affected by its recollection of it; or it may be <lb/>
            future, in which case it is, indeed, the influence of hope and <lb/>
            expectation.</p>
          <p>XIII. " And she shall be called woman." This is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to saying, On this account the outward sensation shall <lb/>
            be called woman, because it is derived from man who sets it in <lb/>
            motion. He says " she ; " why, then, is the expression " she" <lb/>
            used ? Why, because there is also another kind of outward <lb/>
            sensation, not derived from the mind, but having been created <lb/>
            at the same moment with it. For there are, as I have said <lb/>
            before, two different kinds of outward sensation ; the one kind <lb/>
            existing according to habit, and the other according to energy. <lb/>
            Now, the kind existing according to habit is not derived from <lb/>
            the man, that is to say from the mind, but is created at the <lb/>
            same time with him. For the mind, as I have already shown, <lb/>
            when it was created was created with many faculties and <lb/>
            habits; namely, with the faculty and habit of reasoning, and <lb/>
            of existing, and of promoting what is like itself, as also with <lb/>
            that of receiving impressions from the outward senses. But <lb/>
            the outward sensation, which exists according to energy, is <lb/>
            derived from the mind. For it is extended from the outward <lb/>
            sensation which exists in it according to habit, so as to become <lb/>
            the same outward sense according to energy. So that this <lb/>
            second kind of outward sense is derived from the mind, and <lb/>
            exists according to motion. And he is but a foolish person <lb/>
            who thinks that any thing is in true reality made out of the <lb/>
             <pb n="92"/>
            mind, or out of itself. Do you not see that even in the case <lb/>
            of Rachel (that is to say of outward sensation) sitting upon the <lb/>
            images, while she thought that her motions came from the <lb/>
            mind, he who saw her reproved her. For she says, " Give me <lb/>
            my children, and if you give them not to me I shall die.''* <lb/>
            And he replied : " Because, 0 mistaken woman, the mind is <lb/>
            not the cause of any thing, but lie which existed before the <lb/>
            mind ; namely God." On which account he adds: " Am I <lb/>
            equal to God who has deprived you of the fruit of your womb ?" <lb/>
            But that it is God who creates men, he will testify in the <lb/>
            case of Leah, when he says, "But the Lord, when he saw <lb/>
            that Leah was hated, opened her womb. But Rachel was <lb/>
            barren,”† But it is the especial property of man to open the <lb/>
            womb.</p>
          <p>Now naturally virtue is hated by men. On which account <lb/>
            God has honoured it, and gives the honour of bearing the first <lb/>
            child to her who is hated. And in another passage he savs : <lb/>
            " But if a man has two wives, one of them being loved and <lb/>
            one of them being hated, and if they bear him children, and if <lb/>
            the first-born son be the child of her who is hated; he will not <lb/>
            be able to give the honours of the birthright to the child of <lb/>
            the wife whom he loves, overlooking the first-born son the <lb/>
            child of her who is hated.”‡ For the productions of virtue <lb/>
            which is hated, are the first and the most perfect, but those of <lb/>
            pleasure, which is loved, are the last.</p>
          <p>XIV. " On this account a man will leave his father and his <lb/>
            mother and will cleave to his wife; and they two shall become <lb/>
            one flesh." On account of the external sensation, the mind, <lb/>
            when it has become enslaved to it, shall leave both its father, <lb/>
            the God of the universe, and the mother of all things, namely, <lb/>
            the virtue and wisdom of God, and cleaves to and becomes <lb/>
            united to the external sensations, and is dissolved into external <lb/>
            sensation, so that the two become one flesh and one passion. <lb/>
            And here you must observe that it is not the woman who <lb/>
            cleaves to the man, but on the contrary, the man who cleaves to <lb/>
            the woman ; that is to say, the mind cleaves to the external sen­ <lb/>
            sations. For when that which is the better, namely, the mind. <lb/>
            is united to that which is the worse, namely, the external <lb/>
            sensation, it is then dissolved into the nature of flesh, which <note type="footnote"> * Gen. xxx. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Gen. xxix. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. xxi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="93"/>
            is worse, and into outward sensation, which is the cause of the <lb/>
            passions.</p>
          <p>But when that which is the inferior, namely, the outward <lb/>
            sensation, follows the better part, that is the mind, then there <lb/>
            will no longer be flesh, but both will become one, namely, <lb/>
            mind. And this is a thing of such a nature that it prefers the <lb/>
            affections to piety. There is also another being called by an <lb/>
            opposite name, Levi; he who says to his father and mother: <lb/>
            “ He saw you not, and he did not recognize his brethren, and <lb/>
            repudiated his children."* This man leaves his father and <lb/>
            mother; that is to say, his mind and the material of his body, <lb/>
            in order to have as his inheritance the one God ; “ For the <lb/>
            Lord himself is his inheritance. "t And, indeed, suffering is <lb/>
            the inheritance of him who is fond of suffering; but the inhe­ <lb/>
            ritance of Levi is God. Do you not see that " lie bids him on <lb/>
            the tenth day of the month bring two goats as his share, one <lb/>
            lot for the Lord and one lot for the scape-goat." J For the <lb/>
            sufferings inflicted on the scape goat are in real truth the lot <lb/>
            of him who is fond of suffering.</p>
          <p>XV. " And they were both naked, both Adam and his <lb/>
            wife, and they were not ashamed; but the serpent was the <lb/>
            most subtle of all the beasts that were upon the earth, which <lb/>
            the Lord God had made:”§—the mind is naked, which is <lb/>
            clothed neither with vice nor with virtue, but which is really <lb/>
            stripped of both : just as the soul of an infant child, which has <lb/>
            no share in either virtue or vice, is stripped of all coverings, <lb/>
            and is completely naked: for these things are the coverings <lb/>
            of the soul, by which it is enveloped and concealed, good <lb/>
            being the garment of the virtuous soul, and evil the robe of <lb/>
            the wicked soul. And the soul is made naked in these ways. <lb/>
            Once, when it is in an unchangeable state, and is entirely free <lb/>
            from all vices, and has discarded and laid aside the covering <lb/>
            of all the passions. With reference to this Moses also pitches <lb/>
            his tabernacle outside of the camp, a long way from the camp, <lb/>
            and it was called the tabernacle of testimony. || And this <lb/>
            has some such meaning as this : the soul which loves God, <lb/>
            having put off the body and the affections which are dear to <lb/>
            it, and having fled a long way from them, chooses a foundation <lb/>
            and a sure ground for its abode, and a lasting settlement in <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xxxiii. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. x. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Lev. xvi. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Gen. ii. 25; iii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> || Ex. xxxiii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="94"/>
            the perfect doctrines of virtue ; on which account testimony is <lb/>
            borne to it by God, that it loves what is good, " for it was <lb/>
            called the tabernacle of testimony," says Moses, and he has <lb/>
            passed over in silence the giver of the name, in order that the <lb/>
            soul, being excited, might consider who it is who thus beareth <lb/>
            witness to the dispositions which love virtue. On this account <lb/>
            the high priest " will not come into the holy of holies clad in <lb/>
            a garment reaching to the feet but having put off the robe <lb/>
            of opinion and vain fancy of the soul, and having left that for <lb/>
            those who love the things which are without, and who honour <lb/>
            opinion in preference to truth, will come forward naked, with­ <lb/>
            out colours or any sounds, to make an offering of the blood of <lb/>
            the soul, and to sacrifice the whole mind to God the Saviour <lb/>
            and Benefactor; and certainly Nadab and Abihu,t who came <lb/>
            near to God, and left this mortal life and received a share of <lb/>
            immortal life, are seen to be naked, that is, free from all new <lb/>
            and mortal opinion; for they would not have carried it in <lb/>
            their garments and borne it about, if they had not been <lb/>
            naked, having broken to pieces every bond of passion and of <lb/>
            corporeal necessity, in order that their nakedness and absence <lb/>
            of corporeality might not be adulterated by the accession of <lb/>
            atheistical reasonings ; for it may not be permitted to all men <lb/>
            to behold the secret mysteries of God, but only to those who <lb/>
            are able to cover them up and guard them; on which account <lb/>
            Mishael and his partisans concealed them not in their own <lb/>
            garments, but in those of Nadab and Abihu, who had been <lb/>
            burnt with fire and taken upwards; for having stripped off <lb/>
            all the garments that covered them, they brought their naked­ <lb/>
            ness before God, and left their tunics about Mishael. But <lb/>
            clothes belong to the irrational part of the animal, which over­ <lb/>
            shadow the rational part.</p>
          <p>Abraham also was naked when he heard, " Come forth out <lb/>
            of thy land and from thy kindred ;”‡ and as for Isaac, he in­ <lb/>
            deed was not stripped, but was at all times naked and incor­ <lb/>
            poreal ; for a commandment was given to him not to go down <lb/>
            into Egypt,§ that is to say, into the body.</p>
          <p>Jacob also was fond of the nakedness of the soul, for his <lb/>
            smoothness is nakedness, " for Esau was a hairy man, but <note type="footnote"> * Lev. xvi. !. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Gen. xiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Lev. x. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> § Gen. xxvi 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="95"/>
            Jacob," says Moses, " was a smooth man,”* on which account <lb/>
            he was also the husband of Leah.</p>
          <p>XVI. This is the most excellent nakedness, but the other <lb/>
            nakedness is of a contrary nature, being a change which <lb/>
            involves a deprivation of virtue, when the soul becomes foolish <lb/>
            and goes astray. Such was the folly of Noah when he was <lb/>
            naked, when he drank wine.t But thanks be to God, that <lb/>
            this change and this stripping naked of the mind according to <lb/>
            the deprivation of virtue, did not extend as far as external <lb/>
            things, but remained in the house; for Moses says, that " he <lb/>
            was stripped naked in his house for even if a wise man does <lb/>
            commit folly, he still does not run to ruin like a bad man ; for <lb/>
            the evil of the one is spread abroad, but that of the other is <lb/>
            kept within bounds, and therefore he becomes sober again, <lb/>
            that is to say, he repents, and as it were recovers from his <lb/>
            disease.</p>
          <p>But let us now more accurately examine the statement, <lb/>
            " that the stripping of him naked took place in his house." <lb/>
            When the soul, being changed, only conceives some evil thing <lb/>
            and does not put it in execution, so as to accomplish it in <lb/>
            deed, then the sin is only in the private domain and abode of <lb/>
            the soul. But if, in addition to thinking some wickedness it <lb/>
            proceeds also to accomplish it and carry it into execution, <lb/>
            then the wickedness is diffused over the parts beyond his <lb/>
            house: and on this account he curses Canaan also, because he <lb/>
            related the change of his soul abroad, that is to say, he ex­ <lb/>
            tended it into the parts out of doors, and gave it notoriety, <lb/>
            adding to his evil intention an evil consummation by means <lb/>
            of his actions: but Shem and Japhet are praised, because <lb/>
            they did not attack his soul, but rather concealed its de­ <lb/>
            terioration.</p>
          <p>On this account also the prayers and vows of the soul are <lb/>
            invalidated when " they are made in the house of one's father <lb/>
            or one's husband,‡ while the reasoning powers are in a state <lb/>
            of quiescence, and do not attack the alteration which has <lb/>
            taken place in the soul, but conceal the delinquency; for then <lb/>
            also the master of all things" will purify it: but he hears <lb/>
            the prayer of the widow and of her who is divorced without <lb/>
            revoking it; for " wbatever," says he, " she has vowed against <lb/>
            her own soul shall abide to her," and very reasonably; for if, <note type="footnote"> * Gen. xxv. 25. </note><note type="footnote"> <lb/>
            t Gen. ix. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Num. xxx. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="96"/>
            after she has been put away, she has advanced as far as the <lb/>
            parts out of the house, so that not only is her place changed, <lb/>
            but that she also sins in respect of deeds that she has per­ <lb/>
            fected, she remains incurable, having no communion of con­ <lb/>
            versation with her husband, and being deprived also of the <lb/>
            advocacy and consolation of her father.</p>
          <p>The third description of stripping naked is the middle one, <lb/>
            according to which the mind is destitute of reason, having no <lb/>
            share in either virtue or vice ; and it is with reference to this <lb/>
            kind of nakedness which an infant also is partaker of, that the <lb/>
            expression is used which says, " And the two were naked, <lb/>
            both Adam and his wife;" and the meaning of it is this, <lb/>
            neither did their intellect understand, nor did their outward <lb/>
            senses perceive this nakedness; but the former was devoid of <lb/>
            all power of understanding, and naked; and the latter was <lb/>
            destitute of all perception.</p>
          <p>XVII. And the expression, " they were not ashamed," we <lb/>
            will examine hereafter: for there are three ideas brought for­ <lb/>
            ward in this passage. Shamelessness, modesty, and a state of <lb/>
            indifference, in which one is neither shameless nor modest. <lb/>
            Now shamelessness is the property of a worthless person, and <lb/>
            modesty the characteristic of a virtuous one; but the state of <lb/>
            being neither modest nor shameless, is a sign of a person who <lb/>
            is void of comprehension, and who does not act from any <lb/>
            settled opinion; and it is of such a one that we are now <lb/>
            speaking: for he who has not yet acquired any comprehension <lb/>
            of good or evil, is not able to be either shameless or modest, <lb/>
            therefore the examples of shamelessness are all the unseemly <lb/>
            pieces of conduct, when the mind reveals disgraceful things, <lb/>
            while it ought rather to cover them in the shade, instead of <lb/>
            which it boasts of and glories in them. It is said also in the <lb/>
            case of Miriam, when she was speaking against Moses, " If <lb/>
            her father had spit in her face, ought she not to keep herself <lb/>
            retired for seven days ? "*</p>
          <p>For the external sense, being really shameless and impudent, <lb/>
            though considered as nothing by God the father, in com­ <lb/>
            parison of him who was faithful in all his house, to whom God <lb/>
            himself united the Ethiopian woman, that is to say, unchange­ <lb/>
            able and well-satisfied opinion, dared to speak against Moses <lb/>
            and to accuse him, for the very actions for which he deserved <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="97"/>
            to be praised; for this is his greatest praise, that he received <lb/>
            the Ethiopian woman, the unchangeable nature, tried in the <lb/>
            fire and found honest; for as in the eye, the part which sees <lb/>
            is black, so also the part of the soul which sees is what is <lb/>
            meant by the Ethiopian woman. Why then, as there are <lb/>
            many works of wickedness, does he mention one only, namely, <lb/>
            that which is conversant about what is shameful, saying, <lb/>
            " they were not ashamed:" but were they not doing wrong, or <lb/>
            were they not sinning, or were they not acting indecorously ? <lb/>
            But the cause is at hand. No, by the only true God, I think <lb/>
            nothing so shameful as to suppose that I comprehend with <lb/>
            my intellect, or perceive by my outward sense. Is my mind <lb/>
            the cause of my comprehending ? How so ? for does it even <lb/>
            comprehend itself, and know what it is, or how it came to <lb/>
            exist? And are the outward senses the cause of man's per­ <lb/>
            ceiving anything? How can it be said to be so, when it is <lb/>
            neither understood by itself nor by the mind ? Do you not <lb/>
            see, that he who fancies that he comprehends is often found <lb/>
            to be foolish in his acts of covetousness, in his drunkenness, <lb/>
            in his deeds of folly ? Where then is his intellectual capacity <lb/>
            shown in these actions ?</p>
          <p>Again, is not the outward sensation often deprived of the <lb/>
            power of exercising itself? Are there not times when seeing <lb/>
            we do not see, and hearing we do not hear, when the mind <lb/>
            has its attention ever so little drawn off to some other object <lb/>
            of the intellect, and is applied to the consideration of that? <lb/>
            As long as they are both naked, the mind naked of its power <lb/>
            of exciting the intellect, and the outward sense of its power <lb/>
            of sensation, they have nothing disgraceful in them; but the <lb/>
            moment that they begin to display any comprehension, they <lb/>
            become masked in shame and insolence : for they will often be <lb/>
            found behaving with simplicity and folly rather than with any <lb/>
            sound knowledge, and this not only in particular acts of covet­ <lb/>
            ousness, or spleen, or folly, but also in the general conduct of <lb/>
            life: for when the outward sense has the dominion the mind <lb/>
            is enslaved, giving its attention to no one proper object of its <lb/>
            intellect, and when the mind is predominant, the untoward <lb/>
            sense is seen to be without employment, having no compre­ <lb/>
            hension of any proper object for its own exercise.</p>
          <p>XVIII. " Now the serpent was the most subtle of all the <note type="footnote"> H </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="98"/>
            beasts which are upon the earth, which the Lord God made.”* <lb/>
            Two things having been previously created, that is, mind and <lb/>
            outward sense, and these also having been stripped naked in <lb/>
            the manner which has already been shown, it follows of <lb/>
            necessity that pleasure, which brings these two together, must <lb/>
            be the third, for the purpose of facilitating the comprehension <lb/>
            of the objects of intellect and of outward sense: for neither <lb/>
            could the mind, without the outward sense, be able to compre­ <lb/>
            hend the nature of any animal or of any plant, or of a stone or <lb/>
            of a piece of wood, or, in short, of any substance whatever; <lb/>
            nor could the outward sense exercise its proper faculties with­ <lb/>
            out the mind. Since, therefore, it was necessary for both <lb/>
            these things to come together for the due comprehension of <lb/>
            these objects, what was it which brought them together except <lb/>
            a third something which acted as a bond between them, the <lb/>
            two first representing love and desire, and pleasure not ob­ <lb/>
            taining the dominion and mastery, which pleasure Moses here <lb/>
            speaks of symbolically, under the emblem of the serpent. God, <lb/>
            who created all the animals on the earth, arranged this order <lb/>
            very admirably, for he placed the mind first, that is to say, <lb/>
            man, for the mind is the most important part in man; then <lb/>
            outward sense, that is the woman ; and then proceeding in <lb/>
            regular order he came to the third, pleasure. But the powers <lb/>
            of these three, and their ages, are different only in the night, <lb/>
            for in point of time they are equal; for the soul brings for­ <lb/>
            ward everything at the same moment with itself: but some <lb/>
            things it brings forward in their actuality, and others in their <lb/>
            power of existing, even if they have not yet arrived at the end.</p>
          <p>And pleasure has been represented under the form of the <lb/>
            serpent, for this reason, as the motion of the serpent is full <lb/>
            of many windings and varied, so also is the motion of pleasure. <lb/>
            At first it folds itself round a man in five ways, for the plea­ <lb/>
            sures consist both in seeing, and in hearing, and in taste, and <lb/>
            in smell, and in touch. But the most vehement and intense <lb/>
            are those which arise from connection with woman, through <lb/>
            which the generation of similar beings is appointed by nature <lb/>
            to be effected. And yet this is not the only reason why we <lb/>
            say that pleasure is various in appearance, namely, because it <lb/>
            folds itself around all the divisions of the irrational part of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="99"/>
            soul, but because it also folds itself with many windings around <lb/>
            each separate part. For instance, the pleasures derived from <lb/>
            sight are various, there is all the pleasure which arises from <lb/>
            the contemplation of pictures or statues; and all other works <lb/>
            which are made by art delight the sight. So also do the <lb/>
            different stages through which plants go while budding and <lb/>
            flowering and bearing fruit; and likewise the diversified beauty <lb/>
            of the different animals. In the same manner the flute gives <lb/>
            pleasure to the sense of hearing, as does the harp, and every <lb/>
            kind of instrument, and the harmonious voices of the irrational <lb/>
            animals, of swallows, of nightingales; and likewise the melody <lb/>
            of such rational beings as nature has made musical, the tune­ <lb/>
            ful voice of the harp-players, and of those who represent <lb/>
            comedy, or tragedy, or any other histrionic performance.</p>
          <p>XIX. Why need we enlarge on the pleasures of the belly ? <lb/>
            For we may almost say that there are as many varieties of <lb/>
            pleasure as there are of gentle flavours which are presented to <lb/>
            the belly, and which excite the outward sense. Was it not <lb/>
            then, with great propriety that pleasure, which is derived from <lb/>
            many varied sources, was presented to an animal endowed with <lb/>
            varied faculties ? On this account, too, that part in us which <lb/>
            is analogous to the people, and which acts the part of a multi­ <lb/>
            tude, when it seeks "the houses in Egypt,”* that is to say, in <lb/>
            its corporeal habitation, becomes entangled in pleasures which <lb/>
            bring on death; not that death which is a separation of soul <lb/>
            and body, but that which is the destruction of the soul by vice. <lb/>
            For Moses says, "And the Lord God sent among the people <lb/>
            deadly serpents, and they bit the people, and a great multi­ <lb/>
            tude of the children of Israel died.”† For in real truth there <lb/>
            is nothing which so much bringeth death upon the soul as an <lb/>
            immoderate indulgence in pleasures. And that which perishes <lb/>
            is not the dominant portion in us but the subject one, that <lb/>
            which acts the part of the multitude; and it receives death up <lb/>
            to this point, namely, until it turns to repentance, and con­ <lb/>
            fesses its sin,' for the Israelites, coming to Moses, say, "We <lb/>
            have sinned in that we have spoken against the Lord and <lb/>
            against you; pray, therefore, for us to the Lord, and let him <lb/>
            take away the serpents from us." It is well put here, not we <lb/>
            have sinned because we have spoken against the Lord, but <lb/>
            because we were inclined to sin we have spoken against the <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxi. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="100"/>
            Lord, for when the mind sins and departs from virtue, it <lb/>
            blames divine things, imputing its own sins to God.</p>
          <p>XX. How, then, can there be any remedy for this evil ? <lb/>
            When another serpent is created, the enemy of the serpent <lb/>
            which came to Eve, namely, the word of temperance : for <lb/>
            temperance is opposite to pleasure, which is a varied evil, <lb/>
            being a varied virtue, and one ready to repel its enemy plea­ <lb/>
            sure. Accordingly, God commands Moses to make the serpent <lb/>
            according to temperance; and he says, " Make thyself a <lb/>
            serpent, and set it up for a sign." Do you see that Moses <lb/>
            makes this serpent for no one else but for himself? for God <lb/>
            commands him, " Make it for thyself," in order that you may <lb/>
            know that temperance is not the gift of every one, but only of <lb/>
            that mail who loves God. And we must consider why Moses <lb/>
            makes a brazen serpent, when no command was given to him <lb/>
            respecting the material of which it was to be formed. May it <lb/>
            not have been for this reason ? In the first place, the graces <lb/>
            of God are immaterial, being themselves only ideas, and desti­ <lb/>
            tute of any distinctive quality; but the graces of mortal men <lb/>
            are only beheld in connection with matter. In the second <lb/>
            place, not only does Moses love the incorporeal virtues, but <lb/>
            our own souls, not being able to put off their bodies, do like­ <lb/>
            wise aim at corporeal virtue, and reason, in accordance with <lb/>
            temperance, is likened to the strong and solid substance of <lb/>
            brass, inasmuch as it is firm and not easily cut through. And <lb/>
            perhaps brass may also have been selected inasmuch as tempe­ <lb/>
            rance in the man who loves God is a most honourable thing, and <lb/>
            like gold ; though it has only a secondary place in a man who <lb/>
            has received wisdom and improved in it. “ And whomsoever <lb/>
            the one serpent bites, if he looks upon the brazen serpent <lb/>
            shall live:" in which Moses speaks truly, for if the mind <lb/>
            that has been bitten by pleasure, that is by the serpent which <lb/>
            was sent to Eve, shall have strength to behold the beauty <lb/>
            of temperance, that is to say, the serpent made by Moses in a <lb/>
            manner affecting the soul, and to behold God himself through <lb/>
            the medium of the serpent, it shall live. Only let it see and <lb/>
            contemplate it intellectually.</p>
          <p>XXI. Do you not see that wisdom when dominant, which <lb/>
            is Sarah, says, " For whosoever shall hear it shall rejoice <lb/>
            with me.”* But suppose that any were able to hear that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="101"/>
            virtue has brought forth happiness, namely, Isaac, immediately <lb/>
            he will sing a congratulatory hymn. As, therefore, it can only <lb/>
            be one who has heard the news that can sympathise in one's <lb/>
            joy, so also it can only be he who has clearly seen temperance <lb/>
            and God, who is safe from death. But many souls that have <lb/>
            been in love with perseverance and temperance, when removed <lb/>
            to a distance from the passions, have nevertheless withstood <lb/>
            the power of God, and have undergone a change for the worse, <lb/>
            while their Master has made a display of himself and of the <lb/>
            work of creation; of himself, that he is always immovable, <lb/>
            and of the work of creation, that it vibrates as if in a scale, and <lb/>
            inclines opposite ways at different times. For Moses speaks <lb/>
            to the Israelites of God, " Who led ye then through that great <lb/>
            and terrible wilderness, where there were biting serpents, and <lb/>
            scorpions, and thirst; where there was no water ? who brought <lb/>
            forth for thee out of the hard rock a fountain of water ? who <lb/>
            fed thee with manna in the desert, which thy fathers knew <lb/>
            not?"*</p>
          <p>Do you not see that not only did the soul, while longing for <lb/>
            the passions which prevailed in Egypt, fall under the power <lb/>
            of the serpents, but that, also, while it was in the wilderness, <lb/>
            it was bitten by pleasure, that affection of varied and serpent- <lb/>
            like appearance ? And the work of pleasure has received <lb/>
            a most appropriate name, for it is called a biting. Moreover, <lb/>
            not only they who were in the desert were bitten by serpents, <lb/>
            but also they who were scattered abroad, for I, also, often <lb/>
            having left the men who were my kinsmen and my friends, <lb/>
            and my country, and having gone into the desert in order that <lb/>
            I might perceive some of those things which are worthy of <lb/>
            being beheld, have profited nothing. But my mind, being <lb/>
            separated from me, or being bitten by passion, has withdrawn <lb/>
            towards the things opposite to them. And there are times <lb/>
            when in the midst of a multitude composed of infinite numbers <lb/>
            of men, I can bring my mind into solitude, God having seat­ <lb/>
            tered for me the crowd which perplexes my soul, and having <lb/>
            taught me that it is not the difference of place that is the <lb/>
            cause of good and evil, but rather God, who moves and drives <lb/>
            this vehicle of the soul wherever he pleases.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the soul falls in with a scorpion, that is to say, <lb/>
            with dispersion in the wilderness ; and the thirst, which is that <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy viii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="102"/>
            of the passions, seizes on it until God sends forth upon it the <lb/>
            stream of his own accurate wisdom, and causes the changed <lb/>
            soul to drink of unchangeable health ; for the abrupt rock is <lb/>
            the wisdom of God, which being both sublime and the first of <lb/>
            things he quarried out of his own powers, and of it he gives <lb/>
            drink to the souls that love God ; and they, when they have <lb/>
            drunk, are also filled with the most universal manna; for <lb/>
            manna is called something which is the primary genus of every <lb/>
            thing. But the most universal of all things is God; and in <lb/>
            the second place the word of God. But other things have an <lb/>
            existence only in word, but in deed they are at times equivalent <lb/>
            to that which has no existence.</p>
          <p>XXII. See now the difference between him who turns <lb/>
            to sill in the desert and him who sins in Egypt. For <lb/>
            the one is bitten by serpents which cause death, that is to <lb/>
            say by insatiable pleasures which inflict death; but the <lb/>
            other, he who meditates in the wilderness, is only bitten <lb/>
            by pleasure and driven astray, but is not killed. And the <lb/>
            one, indeed, is healed by temperance, which is the brazen <lb/>
            serpent which was made by the wise Moses ; but the other is <lb/>
            supplied by God with a most beautiful draught to drink, <lb/>
            namely, wisdom, from the fountain which He himself has <lb/>
            brought forth out of his own wisdom. Nor, indeed, does the <lb/>
            pleasure which is in the form of a serpent, abstain from attack­ <lb/>
            ing that most sincere lover of God, Moses, for we read as <lb/>
            follows; " If, therefore, they will not obey me, nor listen to <lb/>
            my voice-for they will say, God has not been seen by you— <lb/>
            what shall I say to them ? And the Lord said unto Moses, <lb/>
            What is that which is in thy hand ? And he said, A rod. And <lb/>
            God said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the <lb/>
            ground, and it became a serpent, and Moses fled from it. And <lb/>
            the Lord said unto Moses, Stretch forth thy hand, and take <lb/>
            hold of it by the tail. And having stretched forth his hand, <lb/>
            he took hold of it by the tail, and it became a rod in his <lb/>
            hand. And the Lord said unto him, That they may believe <lb/>
            thee." *</p>
          <p>How can any one believe God ? If he has learnt that all <lb/>
            other things are changed, but that he alone is unchangeable. <lb/>
            Therefore, God asks of the wise Moses what there is in the prac­ <lb/>
            tical life of his soul; for the hand is the symbol of action. And <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="103"/>
            he answers, Instruction, which he calls a rod. On which account <lb/>
            Jacob the supplanter of the passions, says, " For in my staff <lb/>
            did I pass over this Jordan."* But Jordan being interpreted <lb/>
            means descent. And of the lower, and earthly, and perishable <lb/>
            nature, vice and passion are component parts ; and the mind <lb/>
            of the ascetic passes over them in the course of its education. <lb/>
            For it is too low a notion to explain his saying literally; as if it <lb/>
            meant that he crossed the river, holding his staff in his hand.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Well, therefore, does the God-loving Moses answer. <lb/>
            For truly the actions of the virtuous man are supported by <lb/>
            education as by a rod, tranquillizing the disturbances and agita­ <lb/>
            tions of the mind. This rod, when cast away, becomes a ser­ <lb/>
            pent. Very appropriately. For if the soul casts away instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, it becomes fond of pleasure instead of being fond of <lb/>
            virtue. On which account Moses fled from it, for the man <lb/>
            who is fond of virtue does flee from passion and from pleasure. <lb/>
            But God did not praise his flight. For it is fitting, indeed, <lb/>
            for your mind, before you are made perfect, to meditate flight <lb/>
            and escape from the passions; but Moses, that perfect man, <lb/>
            ought rather to persevere in his war against them, and to resist <lb/>
            them, and to strive against them, otherwise they, relying on <lb/>
            their freedom from danger and on their power, will ascend up I <lb/>
            to the citadel of the soul, and take it by storm, and will plunder it <lb/>
            entirely, like a tyrant. On which account God commanded Moses <lb/>
            " to take hold of it by the tail," that is to say, let not the hostile <lb/>
            and untameable spirit of pleasure terrify you, but with all your <lb/>
            power take hold of it, and seize it firmly, and master it. For <lb/>
            it will again become a rod instead of a serpent, that is to say, <lb/>
            instead of pleasure it will become instruction in your hand; <lb/>
            but it will be in your hand, that is in the action of a wise <lb/>
            man, which, indeed, is true.</p>
          <p>But it is impossible to take hold of and to master pleasure, <lb/>
            unless the hand be first stretched out, that is to say, unless <lb/>
            the soul confesses that all actions and all progress is derived <lb/>
            from God ; and attributes nothing to himself. Accordingly he, <lb/>
            when he saw this serpent, decided to flee from it? But he <lb/>
            prepared another principle, that of temperance, which is the <lb/>
            brazen serpent: that whosoever was bitten by pleasure, when <lb/>
            he looked on temperance, might live a real life.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Such a serpent Jacob boasts that Dan is, and he <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxii. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="104"/>
            speaks thus : " Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes <lb/>
            of Israel :”* and again, " Let Dan be a serpent in the path, <lb/>
            sitting upon the road, biting the heel of the horse, and the <lb/>
            rider shall fall backwards, waiting the salvation of the Lord."t <lb/>
            The fifth son of Leah is Issachar, the legitimate son of Jacob; <lb/>
            but if the two sons of Zilpah are counted he is the seventh; <lb/>
            but the fifth son of Jacob is Dan, the son of Billah, the hand­ <lb/>
            maid of Rachel; and the cause of this we will investigate in <lb/>
            the proper place, but concerning Dan we must examine <lb/>
            further now. The soul produces two kinds, the one divine <lb/>
            and the other perishable; that which is the better kind it has <lb/>
            already conceived, and ends in it; for when the soul was able <lb/>
            to confess to God and to yield everything to him, it was not <lb/>
            after that capable of receiving any more valuable possession; <lb/>
            on this account she ceased to bring forth, after she had borne <lb/>
            Judah, the emblem of the disposition of confessing-and now <lb/>
            she begins to form the mortal race-now the mortal race sub­ <lb/>
            sists by imbibing; for, like a foundation, the sense of taste is <lb/>
            the cause of the duration of animals; but the name Billah, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means imbibing. From her was born Dan, <lb/>
            which name being interpreted means judgment, for this kind <lb/>
            distinguishes between and separates immortal from mortal <lb/>
            things, therefore he prays that he may become a workman of <lb/>
            temperance. But he will not pray for Judah, for Judah <lb/>
            already has the capacity of praying to and pleasing God ; <lb/>
            " Therefore let Dan," says he, " be a serpent in the path."- <lb/>
            One path is the soul.</p>
          <p>For as in the roads one may behold a great variety of living <lb/>
            beings, inanimate and animate, irrational and rational, good <lb/>
            and bad, slaves and free, young and old, male and female, <lb/>
            strangers and natural citizens, sick and healthy, mutilated <lb/>
            and perfect; so also in the soul there are motions inanimate, <lb/>
            and imperfect, and diseased, and slavish, and female, and innu­ <lb/>
            merable others of the class of evils; and on the other hand, <lb/>
            there are motions which are living, and perfect, and mas­ <lb/>
            culine, and free, and healthy, and ripe, and virtuous, and <lb/>
            genuine, and really legitimate. Let then the principle of <lb/>
            temperance be a serpent in the soul, which makes its advance <lb/>
            through all the circumstances of life, and let it sit in the <lb/>
            path. But what is the meaning of this expression ?-The <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlix. IT. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="105"/>
            field of virtue is not trodden down ; for they are few who <lb/>
            walk along it, but that of vice is trodden and worn ? And he <lb/>
            recommends him here to occupy and to fill, with ambush and <lb/>
            stratagem, the well-trodden path of passion and vice, in which <lb/>
            the thoughts which are deserters from virtue pass their life.</p>
          <p>XXV. " Biting the heel of the horse.”—Very consistently <lb/>
            the disposition which shakes the stability of the created and <lb/>
            perishable being is called the supplanter, and the passions are <lb/>
            compared to a horse ; for passion has four legs as a horse has, <lb/>
            and is an impetuous beast, and full of insolence, and by nature <lb/>
            a most restive animal. But the reasoning of temperance is <lb/>
            wont to bite, and to wound, and to destroy passion. There­ <lb/>
            fore passion having been tripped up, and having fallen, " the <lb/>
            horseman will fall backwards." We must comprehend that <lb/>
            the horseman who has mounted upon the passions is the <lb/>
            mind, who falls from the passions when they are reasoned <lb/>
            upon closely, and so are supplanted; and it is well figured, <lb/>
            that the soul does not fall forward, for it must not go before <lb/>
            the passions, but rather advance behind them, and behave <lb/>
            with moderation.</p>
          <p>And there is sound learning in what he says here. If the <lb/>
            mind, though desirous to act unjustly, comes too late and falls <lb/>
            backward, it will not act unjustly; but if, when it is moved <lb/>
            onwards to some irrational passion it does not run forward but <lb/>
            remains behind, it will then receive freedom from the do­ <lb/>
            minion of the passions, which is a most excellent thing. On <lb/>
            which account Moses, approving of this backward fall from off <lb/>
            the vices, adds further, " waiting for the salvation of the <lb/>
            Lord," for, in good truth, he who falls from the passions is <lb/>
            saved by God, and remains safe after their operation. May <lb/>
            my soul meet with such a fall as this, and may it never after: <lb/>
            wards remount upon that horselike and restive passion, in order <lb/>
            that it may await the salvation of God, and attain to happiness !</p>
          <p>On this account also it was that Moses praised God in his <lb/>
            hymn, because " the horse and his rider has be thrown into <lb/>
            the sea,"* meaning that he has thrown the four passions, and <lb/>
            the miserable mind which is mounted on them, down into ruin <lb/>
            as to its affairs, and into the bottomless pit, and this is almost <lb/>
            the burden of the whole hymn, to which every other part of it <lb/>
            is referred, and indeed that is the truth; for if once a freedom <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="106"/>
            from the passions occupies the soul, it will become perfectly <lb/>
            happy.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And we must also inquire, what is the reason why <lb/>
            Jacob says, that " the rider will fall backward,"* and Moses <lb/>
            says, that " the horse and his rider have been thrown into <lb/>
            the sea." We must say, therefore, that that which is thrown <lb/>
            into the sea is the Egyptian disposition, which indeed flies <lb/>
            and escapes under the water, that is to say, under the advance <lb/>
            of the passions. But the rider who falls backwards is not one <lb/>
            of the persons who loves to yield to the passions; and the <lb/>
            proof is, that Moses calls the one the horseman (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἱππεὺς</foreign>), <lb/>
            and the other the rider (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀναβάτης</foreign>). Now it is the business <lb/>
            of the horseman to subdue the horse, and when he resists <lb/>
            the rein to make him tractable ; but it is the part of the rider <lb/>
            to be conveyed wherever the animal carries him, and in the <lb/>
            sea it is the office of the pilot to guide the ship, and to keep <lb/>
            it straight, and to preserve it in the right course; but it is <lb/>
            the part of the sailor to endure all that happens to the ship.</p>
          <p>And in reference to this the horseman who subdues the <lb/>
            passions is not drowned in the sea, but dismounting from <lb/>
            them awaits the salvation of the master. Accordingly, the <lb/>
            word of God in Leviticus recommends men " to feed on those <lb/>
            creeping things which'go on four feet, and which have legs <lb/>
            above their feet, so that they are able to leap with them ;"t <lb/>
            among which are the locust, and the attacus, and the acris,‡ <lb/>
            and in the fourth place the serpent-fighter; and very pro­ <lb/>
            perly ; for if pleasure, like a serpent, is an unprofitable and <lb/>
            pernicious thing, then the nature which contends against <lb/>
            pleasure must be a most profitable and saving thing, and this <lb/>
            is temperance.</p>
          <p>Fight thou then, 0 my mind, against every passion, and <lb/>
            especially against pleasure, for " the serpent is the most <lb/>
            subtle of all the beasts that are upon the earth, which the <lb/>
            Lord God has made." And of all the passions the most mis­ <lb/>
            chievous is pleasure. Why so ? Because all things are the <lb/>
            slaves of pleasure; and because the life of the wicked is go­ <lb/>
            verned by pleasure as by a master. Accordingly, the things <lb/>
            which are the efficient causes of pleasure are found to be full <lb/>
            of all wickedness: gold and silver, and glory and honours, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xi. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ These are different kinds of locusts. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="107"/>
            and powers and the objects of the outward senses, and the <lb/>
            mechanical arts, and all other things which cause pleasure, <lb/>
            being very various, and all injurious to the soul; and there <lb/>
            are no sins without extreme wickedness; therefore do thou <lb/>
            array against it the wisdom which contends with serpents; <lb/>
            and struggle in this most glorious struggle, and labour to win <lb/>
            the crown in the contest against pleasure, which subdues every <lb/>
            one else; winning a noble and glorious crown, such as no <lb/>
            assembly of men can confer.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I. "AND Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face <lb/>
            of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the Paradise."* <lb/>
            A doctrine is introduced here which teaches us that the wicked <lb/>
            man is inclined to run away. For the proper city of wise <lb/>
            men is virtue, and he who is incapable of becoming a partaker <lb/>
            in that is driven from his city; and no bad man is capable of <lb/>
            becoming a partaker of it; therefore the bad man alone is <lb/>
            driven away and becomes a banished man. But he who is <lb/>
            banished from virtue is at once concealed from the face of God, <lb/>
            for if the wise men are visible to God, inasmuch as they are <lb/>
            dear to him, it follows plainly that the wicked are all concealed <lb/>
            from him, and enveloped in darkness, as being enemies and <lb/>
            adversaries to right reason. Now that the wicked man is <lb/>
            destitute of a city and destitute of a home, Moses testifies in <lb/>
            speaking of that hairy man who was also a man of varied <lb/>
            wickedness, Esau, when he says, " But Esau was skilful in <lb/>
            hunting, and a rude man."t For it is not natural for vice which <lb/>
            is inclined to be subservient to the passions to inhabit the city <lb/>
            of virtue, inasmuch as it is devoted to the pursuit of rudeness <lb/>
            and ignorance, with great folly. But Jacob, who is full of wis­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis viii. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxv. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="108"/>
            dom, is both a citizen and one who dwells in a house, that is <lb/>
            to say, in virtue. Accordingly Moses says of him, “ But Jacob <lb/>
            is a man without guile, dwelling in a house; ” On which <lb/>
            account also " the midwives, since they feared God made <lb/>
            themselves houses. ”*</p>
          <p>For they, being inclined to seek out the secret mysteries of <lb/>
            God, one of which was that the male children should be pre­ <lb/>
            served alive, build up the actions of virtue, in which they had <lb/>
            previously determined to dwell. Accordingly, in this account <lb/>
            it is shown how the wicked man is destitute of a city and des­ <lb/>
            titute of a home : inasmuch as he is an exile from virtue, but <lb/>
            that the virtuous man has a city and is allotted a home, namely <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>II. And let us in the next place consider how any one is <lb/>
            said to be concealed from God; but unless any one receives <lb/>
            this as an allegorical saying it would be impossible to compre­ <lb/>
            hend what is here stated. For God has completed everything <lb/>
            and has penetrated every thing, and has left no one of all his <lb/>
            works empty or deserted. What kind of place then can any <lb/>
            one occupy in which God is not? And Moses testifies to this <lb/>
            in other passages, when he says, " God is in the heaven above, <lb/>
            and in the earth beneath; and there is nothing anywhere but <lb/>
            he.”† And in another place he speaks in this manner, " I <lb/>
            stood here before you did." ‡ For God is of older date than <lb/>
            any created being, and he will be everywhere, so that it cannot <lb/>
            be possible for any one to be concealed from him : and what <lb/>
            need we wonder at ? For even if any thing were to happen to <lb/>
            us we should not be able to escape the notice of, and to conceal <lb/>
            ourselves from the most elementary of created things ; for <lb/>
            instance, let any one try to flee from the earth, or the water, <lb/>
            or the air, or the heaven, or the entire universe, and he will <lb/>
            fail; for it is impossible but what he must be contained in <lb/>
            these things, for no one will be able to flee out of the world.</p>
          <p>Again how could any man who is unable to conceal himself <lb/>
            from the'parts of the world, and from the whole world itself, be <lb/>
            able to escape the notice of God ? He never could do so. <lb/>
            What then is the meaning of the expression, " they hid them­ <lb/>
            selves?" The bad man thinks that God is in a certain place, <lb/>
            not surrounding it, but being surrounded by it. On which <lb/>
            account also he thinks that he can conceal himself from him, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus L 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy iv. 39. </note> <note type="footnote"> J Exodus xvii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="109"/>
            as if God were without any prevailing reason at a distance from <lb/>
            that part of the world in which he has determined to lurk.</p>
          <p>III. And we must understand this in the following manner. <lb/>
            In the wicked man the true opinion concerning God is over­ <lb/>
            shadowed and kept out of sight, for he is full of darkness, <lb/>
            having no divine irradiation, by means of which he may be <lb/>
            able to contemplate things as they are. And such a man is a <lb/>
            fugitive from the divine company just as a leper is or a man <lb/>
            with any other impure disease, the one bringing together into <lb/>
            the same place God and Creation, two opposite natures of two <lb/>
            different complexions, as the causes of things, when there is <lb/>
            really but one cause, the great Creator ; and the other, a man <lb/>
            afflicted with a foul disease, believing that everything is created <lb/>
            from the world, and again is dissolved into the world, but <lb/>
            thinking that nothing has been created by God, being a follower <lb/>
            of the doctrine of Heraclitus introduces covetousness and <lb/>
            indigence, and one universe, and all kinds of things alter­ <lb/>
            nately. In reference to which the Holy Scripture says " Let <lb/>
            them send forth from the holy soul every leper, and every one <lb/>
            afflicted with foul disease, and every one who is impure in his <lb/>
            soul, both male and female, and all mutilated persons, and all <lb/>
            these who are emasculated, and all whoremongers,”* men <lb/>
            who flee from the authority of one God, and who are expressly <lb/>
            forbidden " to come into the assembly of God ;” † but wise <lb/>
            reasons are not only not concealed, but are even eager to <lb/>
            manifest themselves. Do you not see that Abraham was still <lb/>
            standing in the place of the Lord, and coming near to him <lb/>
            said " do not then destroy the righteous with the impious, ” ‡ <lb/>
            him who is manifest to you and well known by you, with him <lb/>
            who flees from you and seeks to escape your notice, for he <lb/>
            indeed is impious, but the righteous man is one who stands <lb/>
            before you and does not flee. For it is right indeed master <lb/>
            that you alone should be honoured, but it does not follow <lb/>
            that as an impious man is discovered so also is a pious man ; <lb/>
            but it is sufficient if he is just. On which account he says <lb/>
            "do not then destroy the righteous with the wicked." For <lb/>
            not even one single man on earth honours God in a worthy <lb/>
            manner, but only according to righteousness. For when it is <lb/>
            not possible for a man to exhibit due gratitude even to his <lb/>
            parents, for it is impossible for him to become their parents in <note type="footnote"> * Numbers v. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xviii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="110"/>
            his turn; how can it be anything but absolutely impossible <lb/>
            adequately to requite God, or worthily to praise him who created <lb/>
            the whole universe out of things that had no previous existence. <lb/>
            " For God made all virtue."</p>
          <p>VI. Be thou therefore 0 my soul in all your entirety always <lb/>
            visible to God, for three separate times, that is to say for time <lb/>
            divided according to a threefold division; not drawing after <lb/>
            ,you the female passion arising from external sensation, but <lb/>
            offering up to him manly thought, the encourager to and prac­ <lb/>
            tiser of persevering courage. For at three seasons of the <lb/>
            year every male must appear before the Lord the God of Israel"* <lb/>
            this is the injunction of the holy scriptures. On this account <lb/>
            Moses when he appears to God in. visible form, flees from the <lb/>
            dispersing disposition, that is from Pharaoh, who boasts, saying, <lb/>
            that he does not know the Lord, " for Moses,” says he, <lb/>
            " retreated from the presence of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the <lb/>
            land of Midian” † that is to say, being interpreted, in the <lb/>
            judgment of the nature of things; and sat down upon a well, <lb/>
            waiting to see what good which might be drank in God would <lb/>
            rain upon his thirsting and eager soul. Accordingly he <lb/>
            retreats from the impious opinion which is the mistress of the <lb/>
            passions, namely from Pharaoh; and he retreats into Midian, <lb/>
            that is to say into judgment, considering anxiously whether <lb/>
            he ought to live in tranquil inactivity or whether he ought <lb/>
            again to contend with that wicked man to his own destruction. <lb/>
            And he considers whether if he attacks him he shall be able <lb/>
            to gain the victory, from which consideration he restrains him­ <lb/>
            self waiting, as I have already said, to see if God will give to <lb/>
            his deep and not frivolous consideration, a fountain sufficient <lb/>
            to wash away the impetuosity of the king of Egypt, that is to <lb/>
            say of his own passions. And he is thought worthy of grace, <lb/>
            for having fought the good fight in behalf of virtue he never <lb/>
            ceases from warring till he sees the pleasures overthrown and <lb/>
            baulked of their object.</p>
          <p>And with this view Moses does not flee from Pharaoh, for <lb/>
            if he had done so he would have fled without returning ; but <lb/>
            withdraws for a time, that is to say he makes a truce from the <lb/>
            war, after the fashion of a wrestler who seeks a respite and <lb/>
            collects his breath again, until, having aroused the alliance of <lb/>
            prudence and the other virtues he attacks his enemy once <note type="footnote"> It Deuteronomy xvi. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus ii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="111"/>
            more, by divine reason, with the most vigorous power. But <lb/>
            Jacob, for he is a supplanter, having acquired virtue by regu­ <lb/>
            lar system and discipline, not without hard labour, for his <lb/>
            name had not as yet been changed to Israel, " fled from the <lb/>
            affairs of labour *" that is to say from colours and figures, and <lb/>
            in short from bodies the nature of which is to wound the soul <lb/>
            through the objects of outward sense ; for since, when he was <lb/>
            present, he could not entirely and utterly subdue them, he <lb/>
            fled, fearing to be subdued by them. And he is very worthy <lb/>
            of praise for so doing; for " says Moses you will make the <lb/>
            children of Israel cautious,† " but not bold, or covetous of those <lb/>
            things, which do not belong to them.</p>
          <p>V. "And Jacob concealed himself from Laban the Syrian, <lb/>
            in that he told him not that he was about to flee from him, <lb/>
            and he fled from him, taking with him all that he had, and <lb/>
            he crossed the river, and proceeded towards the Mount <lb/>
            Gilead." It was most natural for him to conceal that he was <lb/>
            about to flee, and not to inform Laban, who was a man de­ <lb/>
            pending wholly on thoughts such as arise from the outward <lb/>
            senses, just as if you have seen some excellent beauty and are <lb/>
            charmed with it, and are likely to be led into error in respect <lb/>
            of it, you should privily flee from the imagination of it, and <lb/>
            never tell it to your mind, that is to say, never think of it <lb/>
            again nor give it any consideration, for continued recollec­ <lb/>
            tions of anything are not without making some distinct im­ <lb/>
            pression, and injure the intellect and turn it out of the right <lb/>
            way, even against its will. And the same reasoning applies <lb/>
            to all temptations which arise in respect of any one of the ex­ <lb/>
            ternal senses, for in all such cases secret flight is the preserver <lb/>
            from danger. But to keep recalling the temptation to one's <lb/>
            mind, and to talk of it and dwell upon it subdues and enslaves <lb/>
            the reason by force. Do not these then ever, 0 my mind, <lb/>
            report to yourself any object of outward sense that has been <lb/>
            seen by you, if you are likely to be led away captive by it, and <lb/>
            do not dwell on it, in order that you may not become miser­ <lb/>
            able by being subdued by it, but rather, while you are still <lb/>
            free, rise up and flee, preferring untamed liberty to slavery <lb/>
            and subjection to a master.</p>
          <p>VI. But why now, as if Jacob had been ignorant that <lb/>
            Laban was a Syrian, does Moses say, " And Jacob concealed <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xv. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="112"/>
            himself from Laban the Syrian." This expression, however, <lb/>
            has a reason in it which is not superfluous; for the name <lb/>
            Syria, being interpreted, means high. Jacob, therefore, being <lb/>
            an experienced man, that is to say, being mind, when he sees <lb/>
            passion low and powerless, abides it, thinking that he shall be <lb/>
            able to subdue it by force : but when he beholds it high, and <lb/>
            bearing its neck haughtily, and full of arrogance, then ex­ <lb/>
            perienced mind flees first, and afterwards the other parts of <lb/>
            his experience do also flee, namely reading, meditation, care, <lb/>
            the recollection of what is honourable, temperance, the energy <lb/>
            in pursuit of what is becoming; and so he crosses over the <lb/>
            river of the objects affecting the outward senses, which wash <lb/>
            over and threaten to submerge the soul by the impetuosity of <lb/>
            the passions, and having crossed over he proceeds towards the <lb/>
            high and lofty reason of perfect virtue; for " he proceeded to­ <lb/>
            wards the Mount of Gilead;" and Gilead being interpreted <lb/>
            means the migration of testimony, since God caused the soul <lb/>
            to migrate from the passions which surrounded Laban, and <lb/>
            bore witness to it, that it should migrate and receive another <lb/>
            settlement, because it was profitable and expedient, and con­ <lb/>
            ducted it onwards from the evils calculated to render the soul <lb/>
            base, and seeking the things that are on the earth, to the <lb/>
            height and magnitude of virtue.</p>
          <p>On this account Laban, the friend of the outward senses, <lb/>
            and one who energised according to them and not according to <lb/>
            his mind, is indignant, and pursues after him and says, " why <lb/>
            did you flee from me secretly, and not remain for the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of your soul, and for the opinions which judge concerning <lb/>
            the body and the external good things of the world ?" But in <lb/>
            fleeing from this opinion you have despoiled me also of my <lb/>
            prudence, Leah and Rachel; for they, when they remained in <lb/>
            the soul created, prudence in it, but now that they have de­ <lb/>
            parted they have left it ignorance and inexperience." On <lb/>
            which account he adds, " You have stripped me," that is to <lb/>
            say, you have robbed me of my prudence.</p>
          <p>VII. And what that prudence was he will proceed to tell <lb/>
            us, for he adds, " And you have led away my daughters as <lb/>
            captives; and if you had told me, I would myself have sent <lb/>
            you away."* You would not have sent away things which <lb/>
            were at variance with one another, for if you had sent them | <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="113"/>
            away really, and had emancipated the soul, yon would have <lb/>
            removed from it all bodily sounds, and such as affect the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses; for in this way the intellect is emancipated from <lb/>
            evils and passions. But now you say that you send it away <lb/>
            free, but by your actions you confess that you would have re­ <lb/>
            tained it in a prison; for if you had sent it on its way with <lb/>
            musical instruments, and drums and harps, and all the plea­ <lb/>
            sures which affect the outward senses, you would not in reality <lb/>
            have released it at all; for it is not you then only from whom <lb/>
            we are fleeing, 0 Laban, thou companion of bodies and <lb/>
            colours, but we are also escaping from everything that is thine, <lb/>
            in which the voices of the outward senses sound in harmony <lb/>
            with the energies of the passions. For we, if at least we are <lb/>
            practisers of virtue, have meditated a very necessary meditation, <lb/>
            which Jacob also meditated, namely, to overthrow and destroy <lb/>
            those gods who are hostile to the soul, gods made by hands, <lb/>
            gods whom Moses forbade the people to make ;* and these <lb/>
            gods are the destruction of virtue and of a good state of the <lb/>
            passions, but the consolidation and confirmation of vice and <lb/>
            the appetites; for that metal which is cast, after it has been <lb/>
            fused, is soon consolidated again.</p>
          <p>VITI. But Moses speaks thus, " And they gave to Jacob <lb/>
            the foreign gods which were in their hands, and the earrings <lb/>
            which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the tur­ <lb/>
            pentine tree which was in Shechem. ”† These are the gods of <lb/>
            the wicked, but Jacob is not said to have taken them, but to <lb/>
            have concealed and destroyed them, for every case being most <lb/>
            accurately described, for the virtuous man will take nothing <lb/>
            from wickedness for his own advantage, but will conceal all <lb/>
            such things and destroy them secretly. Just as Abraham <lb/>
            tells the king of Sodom, when he was proposing to give him <lb/>
            things of irrational nature in exchange for rational animals, <lb/>
            namely, horses in exchange for men, " that he would take <lb/>
            nothing that belonged to him, but that he would stretch out <lb/>
            “ the action of his soul ..... which, speaking symbolically, he <lb/>
            called " his hand," to the most high God;t " for that he had <lb/>
            not taken from a thread even to a shoe-latchet of all that was <lb/>
            his (the king of Sodom's), in order that the king might never <lb/>
            say that he had made the discerning man," namely Abraham, <lb/>
            " rich," exchanging poverty for wealthy virtue. <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxv. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xiv. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> I </note> <pb n="114"/>
            </p>
          <p>The passions are always concealed and guarded in Shechem ; <lb/>
            and the name Shechem being interpreted means " the shoul­ <lb/>
            der for he who labours concerning pleasures is inclined to <lb/>
            preserve them. But the passions are concealed and destroyed <lb/>
            by the wise man, and that too not for a brief space of time, <lb/>
            but up to this present day, that is to say, for ever, for all <lb/>
            time is measured by the present day, for the cycle of one day <lb/>
            is the measure of all time. On which account Jacob gives <lb/>
            Joseph Shechem,* as an especial portion beyond the rest of <lb/>
            his brethren, meaning thereby the bodily things which are the <lb/>
            objects of the outward senses, since he had gone through <lb/>
            labour in respect of them; but to Judah the confessor he gave <lb/>
            not presents but praise, and hymns and divine songs, in <lb/>
            which he should be celebrated by his brethren. And Jacob <lb/>
            did not receive Shechem as a gift from God, but he took it <lb/>
            with his sword and with his bow, that is to say, by words, <lb/>
            which had the power of cutting and repelling; for the wise <lb/>
            man subjects all secondary things to himself, and when he has <lb/>
            so subjected them he does not retain them, but makes a pre­ <lb/>
            sent of them to him who is by nature adapted to them. Do <lb/>
            you not see that also, when he appeared to take the gods, he <lb/>
            did not take them, but concealed them and put them out of <lb/>
            the way, and destroyed them out of his sight for ever. Now <lb/>
            to what soul could it have happened to conceal vice and to put <lb/>
            it out of the way, except to that soul to which God was re­ <lb/>
            vealed, and which he considered worthy to receive the reve­ <lb/>
            lation of his unspeakable mysteries ? For he says, " shall I <lb/>
            hide from Abraham my son that thing which I am doing ?"t <lb/>
            Well done, 0 Saviour, in that thou showest thy works to the <lb/>
            soul which desires good things, and has concealed from it no <lb/>
            one of thy works: and by reason of this conduct of thine he <lb/>
            is able to avoid evil, and to conceal it and keep it out of sight, <lb/>
            and to destroy for ever the passions which are injurious.</p>
          <p>IX. We have shown, therefore, in what manner the wicked <lb/>
            man is a fugitive, and how he conceals himself from God; but <lb/>
            now let us consider where he conceals himself. " In the <lb/>
            middle," says Moses, " of the trees of the garden;”‡ that is <lb/>
            to say, in the middle of the mind, which again is itself the <lb/>
            centre of the whole soul, as the trees are of the garden. For <lb/>
            the man who escapes from God flees to himself, for, since <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis. xviii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis ii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="115"/>
            there are two things, the mind of the universe, which is God, <lb/>
            and also the separate mind of each individual, he who escapes <lb/>
            from the mind which is in himself flees to the mind of the <lb/>
            universe; and conversely, he who forsakes his own individual <lb/>
            mind, confesses that all the things of the human mind are <lb/>
            of no value, and attributes everything to God ; again, he who <lb/>
            seeks to escape from God asserts, by so doing, that God is not <lb/>
            the cause of anything, but looks upon himself as the cause of <lb/>
            everything that exists.</p>
          <p>At all events it is affirmed by many people, that everything <lb/>
            in the world is borne on spontaneously without any guide or <lb/>
            governor, and that the human mind, by its own single power, <lb/>
            has invented arts and pursuits, and laws and customs, and all <lb/>
            the principles of political and individual, and common justice, <lb/>
            with reference both to men and to irrational animals. But <lb/>
            dost thou not see, 0 soul, the unreasonable character of these <lb/>
            opinions? For one of them having the particular mind, <lb/>
            which was created and which is mortal, does in reality ascribe <lb/>
            it to the mind of the universe, which is uncreated and im­ <lb/>
            mortal : and the other again, repudiating God, most inconsist­ <lb/>
            ently drags forward, as an ally, that mind which is unable <lb/>
            even to assist itself.</p>
          <p>X. On this account also Moses says, that " If a thief be de­ <lb/>
            tected in the act of breaking into a house, and be smitten so <lb/>
            that he die, that shall not be imputed as murder to him who <lb/>
            has smitten him; but if the sun be risen upon him, then he is <lb/>
            liable, and shall die in retaliation."* For if any one cuts <lb/>
            down and destroys that reason which stands upright and is <lb/>
            sound and correct, which testifies to God that he alone is able <lb/>
            to do everything, and is found in the act of breaking in upon <lb/>
            it, that is to say, standing over this reason thus wounded and <lb/>
            destroyed, and who recognises his own mind as energising, <lb/>
            and not God, is a thief, taking away what belongs to others, <lb/>
            for all things belong to God; so he who attributes anything <lb/>
            to himself is taking away what belongs to another, and receives <lb/>
            a very severe blow and one difficult to heal, namely, arro­ <lb/>
            gance, a thing nearly akin to imprudence and ignorance. But <lb/>
            he says nothing as to the name of him who has smitten him, <lb/>
            for the smiter is not a different person from him who is <lb/>
            smitten. <note type="footnote"> Exodus xxii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> I 2 </note> <pb n="116"/>
            </p>
          <p>But as a man who rubs himself is likewise a person who is <lb/>
            rubbed, and as he who stretches himself out is also the person <lb/>
            who is streched out, for he himself both exerts the power of <lb/>
            the agent, and also fills the part of the patient. In like <lb/>
            manner is he, who steals the things which belong to God, and <lb/>
            attributes them to himself, subjected to the tortures of his <lb/>
            own impiety and arrogance. Would that the man so stricken <lb/>
            might die, that is to say might perish before he had succeeded <lb/>
            in his objects, for then he will appear to be less sinful, for <lb/>
            of vice one kind is discerned in habit, and another kind in <lb/>
            motion ; but the one which is discerned in motion has an <lb/>
            inclination towards the perfecting of its operation, on which <lb/>
            account it is more mischievous than the one which is discerned <lb/>
            only in habit. If therefore the mind, which imagines itself <lb/>
            and not God to be the cause of things, dies, that is to say, <lb/>
            becomes inactive and contracts itself, then there is no cause of <lb/>
            death in it; it has not absolutely destroyed the living opinion, <lb/>
            which attributes all power, and all exertion of power to God, <lb/>
            but if the Sun rises, that is to say the mind which appears <lb/>
            brilliant in us, and if it appears to see through everything and <lb/>
            to judge everything, and not to flee from itself, it then <lb/>
            becomes liable to death, and shall die in retaliation for the <lb/>
            living doctrine which it has destroyed ; according to which God <lb/>
            alone is the cause of everything, being found to be wholly <lb/>
            unable to effect any good purpose, and to be truly dead in as <lb/>
            much as it has shown itself the interpreter of a lifeless and <lb/>
            dead and departed doctrine.</p>
          <p>XI. And it is in reference to this that the Holy Scripture <lb/>
            curses " any one who has placed in any secret place any carved <lb/>
            thing, or any thing made of cast metal, the work of the hands <lb/>
            of an artist."* For why, 0 mind, do you store and treasure <lb/>
            up within yourself depraved opinions, that God is a being of <lb/>
            such and such qualities, (he who has no distinctive qualities) <lb/>
            like a carved work; or that he who is imperishable is perish­ <lb/>
            able like images that are cast in the foundry; and why do you <lb/>
            not rather bring them forward openly that you may learn what <lb/>
            is right from men who practise the truth? For you think <lb/>
            that you are endowed with some great skill because you have <lb/>
            devised absurd opinions imposing upon you by an appearance <lb/>
            of probability, in opposition to the truth : but in reality you <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxvii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="117"/>
            are proved to be destitute of skill, in as much as you are <lb/>
            unwilling to be healed of that terrible disease of the soul, <lb/>
            ignorance,</p>
          <p>XII. But that the wicked man sinks into and is concealed <lb/>
            within his own scattered mind, fleeing from the real mind or <lb/>
            truth, is testified by Moses who smote the Egyptian and <lb/>
            buried him in the sand," * the meaning of which is that he by <lb/>
            his arguments convinced him who asserted that the good <lb/>
            things of the body were the most excellent, and who thought <lb/>
            that the good things of the soul were of no value, and who <lb/>
            likewise esteemed the pleasures as the end of life. For when <lb/>
            lie had comprehended the labour of him who beholds God, <lb/>
            which the king of Egypt had imposed on him, (and by the <lb/>
            king of Egypt is meant vice, which is the guide of the passions) <lb/>
            he sees an Egyptian man, that is to say human passions <lb/>
            operating at a seasonable moment, beating and insulting the <lb/>
            man who beholds God, and looking round upon the whole <lb/>
            soul on this side and on that side, and seeing no one standing <lb/>
            by except the true God, and everything else in a state of con­ <lb/>
            fusion and disorder, having stricken down and convicted the <lb/>
            lover of pleasure, he hides him in the dispersed and agitated <lb/>
            mind, which is deprived of all kindred with and comprehension <lb/>
            of what is good.</p>
          <p>This man then is hidden in himself, but the man who is <lb/>
            opposite to him escapes from himself, and flees to the God of <lb/>
            all existing things.</p>
          <p>XIII. On which account Moses says moreover, " He led <lb/>
            him forth out of doors and said to him, look up to heaven, and <lb/>
            count the stars," t which we should be glad indeed to see <lb/>
            thoroughly and to comprehend ; since we are insatiable in <lb/>
            our love for notice, but nevertheless we are unable to measure <lb/>
            the riches of God. Nevertheless thanks be to that magnifi­ <lb/>
            cent and bounteous God because he says that he has implanted <lb/>
            in the soul seeds as brilliant, as visible at a distance, and as <lb/>
            eternally new as the stars in heaven. And it is not a super­ <lb/>
            fluous addition when after having said " he led him forth," he <lb/>
            subjoins " out of doors," for who is ever led forth in doors ? <lb/>
            But perhaps what he says here has some such meaning as <lb/>
            this ; he led him forth into the outermost place, not into some <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="118"/>
            place or other out of doors, which might he surrounded by <lb/>
            other places.</p>
          <p>For as in dwelling houses the man's character is outside <lb/>
            the woman's chamber, and the inner chamber is within, and <lb/>
            the vestibule is outside of the hall but within the doorway, so <lb/>
            also in the case of the soul that which is within one thing <lb/>
            may be outside of some other thing. This then is the sense <lb/>
            in which we must understand this passage; he led the mind <lb/>
            forth into the outermost place, for what was the use of his <lb/>
            leaving the body and fleeing to the outward senses; and <lb/>
            what would have been the use of his discarding the outward <lb/>
            senses, and subjecting that which exists to the voice? For it <lb/>
            is fitting that the mind which is about to be led forth, and to <lb/>
            be dismissed in freedom should be emancipated from all cor­ <lb/>
            poreal necessities, from all the organs of the outward senses, <lb/>
            from all sophistical ratiocinations, and plausible persuasions, <lb/>
            and last of all from itself.</p>
          <p>XV. On which account in another passage also he boasts, <lb/>
            saying " the Lord the God of Heaven, and the God of earth <lb/>
            who took me out of the house of my father."* For it is not <lb/>
            possible for one who dwells in the body and belongs to the race of <lb/>
            mortals to be united with God, but he alone can be so whom <lb/>
            God delivers from that prison house of the body. On which <lb/>
            account also, that joy of the soul, Isaac, when he is conversing <lb/>
            and discoursing privately with God, comes forth forsaking <lb/>
            himself and his own mind, for he says, " Come forth, 0 Isaac, <lb/>
            to converse in the plain towards evening, "t and Moses, <lb/>
            that word of prophecy, says, “When I go forth from the city," <lb/>
            that is from my soul, (for the soul is the city of the living <lb/>
            creature, in as much as it is the soul which gives it its laws <lb/>
            and customs), " I will stretch forth my hands,”‡ and I will <lb/>
            reveal and unfold all my actions to God, invoking him as a <lb/>
            witness and inspector of every one of them, from whom it is <lb/>
            impossible by its own nature that vice should be hidden, but <lb/>
            to whom it must be unfolded and by whom it must be clearly <lb/>
            discerned.</p>
          <p>When therefore the soul is made manifest in all its sayings <lb/>
            and doings, and is made a partaker of the divine nature, the <lb/>
            voices of the external senses are reduced to silence, and so <lb/>
            likewise are all troublesome and ill-omened sounds, for the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxiv. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxiv. 62. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus ix. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="119"/>
            objects of sight often speak loudly and invite the sense of <lb/>
            sight to themselves ; and so do voices invite the sense of hear­ <lb/>
            ing; scents invite the smell, and altogether each varied object <lb/>
            of sense invites its appropriate sense. But all these things <lb/>
            are put at rest when the mind going forth out of the city of <lb/>
            the soul, attributes all its own actions and conceptions to God.</p>
          <p>XV. " For the hands of Moses are heavy.* " For since <lb/>
            the actions of the wicked man are like the wind and light, <lb/>
            those of the wise man on the other hand are heavy and <lb/>
            immoveable, and not easily shaken; in reference to which his <lb/>
            hands are held up by Aaron, who is reason, or by Ur, who is <lb/>
            light. Now of all existing things there is nothing clearer <lb/>
            than the truth; therefore Moses intends here to signify by <lb/>
            a symbolical form of expression, that the actions of the wise <lb/>
            man are supported by the most necessary of all qualities, rea­ <lb/>
            son and truth. On this account also, when Aaron dies, that is <lb/>
            to say, when the truth is completely asserted, he ascends up to <lb/>
            Ur,t that is to say, to Light; for the proper end of reason is <lb/>
            truth, which is more visible than any light, and to it reason is <lb/>
            always striving to come.</p>
          <p>Do you not see that also when he received the tabernacle <lb/>
            from God, and this tabernacle is wisdom, in which the <lb/>
            wise man tabernacles and, dwells, he fixed it firmly and <lb/>
            founded and built it up strongly, not in the body but out of it; <lb/>
            for he likens this to an encampment, to a camp I say full of <lb/>
            wars and of all the evils which war causes, and which has no <lb/>
            portion with peace.</p>
          <p>" And it was called the tabernacle of testimony that is to <lb/>
            say wisdom was borne witness to by God. For every one who <lb/>
            seeks the Lord went forth out of his house. And this is well <lb/>
            said. For if you seek God, 0 my mind, go forth out of your­ <lb/>
            self, and so seek for him; but if you remain in the substance <lb/>
            of the body, or in the vain opinions of the mind, you are then <lb/>
            without any real wish to search into divine things, even if you <lb/>
            do put on the appearance and pretence of seeking them. If <lb/>
            when you search you will find God, is uncertain; for there <lb/>
            have been many persons to whom he has not revealed <lb/>
            himself, but they have expended a vain labour all their time. <lb/>
            But the mere act of seeking for him is sufficient to entitle <lb/>
            you to a participation in good things, for the desire for what <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xx. 25. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxxiii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="120"/>
            is good, even if it fails in attaining the end which it seeks, <lb/>
            does at all events always gladden the heart of those who <lb/>
            cherish it.</p>
          <p>Thus the wicked man who flees from virtue, and who seeks <lb/>
            to conceal himself from God, flees to a powerless ally, that is <lb/>
            his own mind, but the good man on the contrary seeking to <lb/>
            escape from himself turns to the knowledge of the one God, <lb/>
            and is victorious in the honourable race, and in that contest <lb/>
            which is of all the most excellent.</p>
          <p>] 6. " And the Lord God called Adam, and said unto him, <lb/>
            where art thou ? "* Why now is Adam, alone called, when his <lb/>
            wife also was concealed together with him ? In the first place <lb/>
            we must say that the mind is summoned, and asked where it <lb/>
            is. When it is converted, and reproved for its offence, not <lb/>
            only is it summoned itself but all its faculties are also sum­ <lb/>
            moned, for without its faculties the mind by itself is found <lb/>
            to be naked, and to be absolutely nothing, and one of its <lb/>
            faculties is also the outward sense, that is to say the woman. <lb/>
            The woman therefore, that is the outward sense is also sum­ <lb/>
            moned together with Adam, that is the mind, but separately <lb/>
            God does not summon her. Why not? Because being <lb/>
            destitute of reason she is incapable of being convicted by herself. <lb/>
            For neither can sight, nor hearing, nor any one of the other <lb/>
            external senses be taught, and moreover none of them are <lb/>
            capable of receiving the comprehension of things; for the <lb/>
            Creator has not made them capable of distinguishing anything <lb/>
            but bodies only. But the mind is able to receive teaching: <lb/>
            on account of which fact God calls that, but not the external <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>17. And the expression “Where art thou?" admits of being <lb/>
            interpreted in many ways. In the first place it may be taken <lb/>
            not as an interrogation, but as an affirmation, equivalent to <lb/>
            the words " You are somewhere," if you alter the accent on <lb/>
            the particle <foreign xml:lang="grc">που</foreign> "where." For, since you have thought that God <lb/>
            was walking in the garden, and was surrounded by it, learn <lb/>
            now that in this you were mistaken, and hear from God who <lb/>
            knows all things that most true statement that God is not in <lb/>
            any one place. For he is not surrounded by anything, but he <lb/>
            does himself surround everything. For that which is created <note type="footnote"> * Genesis in. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="121"/>
            is in place; for it is inevitable that it must be surrounded, <lb/>
            and not be the thing which surrounds.</p>
          <p>In the second place, that which is said is equivalent to this, <lb/>
            Where hast thou been, 0 soul ? What evils has thou chosen <lb/>
            instead of what good things ? When God invited you to a <lb/>
            participation in virtue, have you pursued vice? And when <lb/>
            he offered to you for your enjoyment the tree of life, that is to <lb/>
            say the tree of wisdom by which you might live, have you has­ <lb/>
            tened into ignorance and to destruction, preferring misery, tho <lb/>
            death of the soul to the happiness of eternal life ?</p>
          <p>The third interpretation is the interrogative one; to which <lb/>
            there may be two answers given. The one, if the answer be <lb/>
            given to the inquirer, " Where art thou?" is, " Nowhere." For <lb/>
            the soul of the wicked man has no place to which it can go, or <lb/>
            in which it can be situated. In respect of which fact the <lb/>
            wicked man is said to be destitute of place; but an evil desti­ <lb/>
            tute of place is one which is difficult to manage. And such is <lb/>
            the man who is void of good qualities, being always agitated <lb/>
            and in a state of confusion, and wavering about after the <lb/>
            fashion of an unsteady breeze being altogether the companion <lb/>
            of no single steady opinion.</p>
          <p>The other answer may be of this kind; that which Adam <lb/>
            himself uses. " Hear where I am," where those are who are <lb/>
            unable to see God ; where those are who do not listen to God ; <lb/>
            where those are who endeavour to conceal themselves from <lb/>
            him who is the author of all things: where those are who flee <lb/>
            from virtue, where those are who are destitute of wisdom, <lb/>
            where those are who are alarmed and tremble because of the <lb/>
            unmanliness and cowardice of their souls. For when Adam <lb/>
            says, "I heard thy voice in the paradise and I was afraid <lb/>
            because I was naked and I hid myself," he exhibits all the <lb/>
            qualities enumerated above, as I have shown, more at length, in <lb/>
            the former books of this treatise.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And yet Adam is not now naked. It has been said a <lb/>
            little before that " they made themselves girdles," but by this <lb/>
            expression Moses intends to teach you that he is not meaning <lb/>
            here to speak of the nakedness of the body, but of that in res­ <lb/>
            pect of which the mind is found to be wholly deficient in and <lb/>
            destitute of virtue. "The woman," says Adam, “whom you <lb/>
            gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree and I did eat.”</p><pb n="122"/>
            
          <p>The expression here is very accurate, inasmuch as he does not <lb/>
            say, " The woman whom you gave to me," but " The woman <lb/>
            whom you gave to be with me." For you did not give me the <lb/>
            outward senses as a possession, but you left them free and unim­ <lb/>
            peded, and in some sort not at all yielding to the injunctions <lb/>
            of my intellect. If therefore the mind were to be inclined to <lb/>
            command the sight not to see, it nevertheless would see any <lb/>
            subject which came before it. And the hearing also will in <lb/>
            every case apprehend any sound which falls upon it, even if <lb/>
            the mind in its jealousy were to command it not to hear. <lb/>
            And again the smell will smell every scent which reaches it, <lb/>
            even if the mind were to forbid it to apprehend it.</p>
          <p>On this account it is that God did not give the outward <lb/>
            sense to the creature, but to be with the creature. And the <lb/>
            meaning of this is, the inward sense in conjunction with our <lb/>
            mind knows every thing, and does so too at the same moments <lb/>
            with the mind. As for instance the sense of sight in con­ <lb/>
            junction and simultaneously with the mind strikes upon the <lb/>
            subject of sight; for the eye sees the substance, and imme­ <lb/>
            diately the mind comprehends the thing seen, that is black or <lb/>
            white, or pale, or red, or triangular, or quadrangular, or round, <lb/>
            or that is of any other colour or shape as the case may be. <lb/>
            And so again the sense of hearing is affected by a sound, and <lb/>
            with the sense of hearing the mind is also affected; and the <lb/>
            proof of it is this; the mind immediately distinguishes the <lb/>
            character of the voice, that it is thin, or that it has substance, <lb/>
            or that it is melodious and tuneful; or, on the other hand, that <lb/>
            it is out of tune and inharmonious. And the same is found <lb/>
            to be the case in respect of the rest of the inward senses.</p>
          <p>And very appropriately do we see that Adam adds this <lb/>
            assertion, " She gave me of the tree;" but he gives an habi­ <lb/>
            tation made of wood and perceptible by the outward senses to <lb/>
            the mind except that outward sense itself. For what gave to <lb/>
            the mind to be able to distinguish body, or whiteness ? Was <lb/>
            it not the sight ? And what enabled it to distinguish sounds ? <lb/>
            Was it not the hearing ? What, again, endowed it with the <lb/>
            faculty of judging of smells? Was it not the sense of smell ? <lb/>
            What enabled it to decide upon flavours? Was it not the <lb/>
            taste? What invested it with the power of distinguishing <lb/>
            between rough and smooth ? Was it not the touch ? Cor­ <lb/>
             <pb n="123"/>
            rectly, therefore, and with complete truth was it said by the <lb/>
            mind, that it was the outward sense alone which gave me the <lb/>
            power to comprehend the corporeal substance.</p>
          <p>XIX. And God said to the woman, " What is this that thou <lb/>
            hast done ?" And she said, " The serpent beguiled me and I <lb/>
            did eat." God asks one question of the outward sense, and <lb/>
            she replies to a different one. For he is putting a question <lb/>
            which has reference to the man ; but she in her reply speaks <lb/>
            not of the man but of herself, saying, " I ate," not I gave. <lb/>
            May we then by the use of allegory solve the question which <lb/>
            was here put, and show that the woman gave a felicitous and <lb/>
            correct answer to the question ? For it follows of necessity <lb/>
            that when she had eaten, her husband did also eat, for when <lb/>
            the outward sense striking upon its object is filled with its <lb/>
            appearance, then immediately the mind joins it and takes its <lb/>
            share of it, and is in a manner made perfect by the nourish­ <lb/>
            ment which it receives from it. This therefore is what she <lb/>
            says, I unintentionally gave it to my husband, for while I <lb/>
            was applying myself to what was presented to me, he, being <lb/>
            very easily and quickly moved, impressed its appearance and <lb/>
            image upon himself.</p>
          <p>XX. But take notice that the man says that the woman gave <lb/>
            it to him; but that the woman does not say that the serpent <lb/>
            gave it to her, but that he beguiled her; for it is the especial <lb/>
            property of the outward sense to give, but it is the attribute of <lb/>
            pleasure which is of a diversified and serpent-like nature to <lb/>
            deceive and to beguile. For instance, the outward sense <lb/>
            presents to the mind the image of what is white by nature, or <lb/>
            black, or hot, or cold, not deceiving it, but acting truly; for <lb/>
            the subjects of the outward sense are of such a character, as <lb/>
            also is the imagination which presents itself to man from <lb/>
            them, in the case of the great majority of men who do not <lb/>
            carry their knowledge of natural philosophy to any accurate <lb/>
            extent. But pleasure does not present to the mind that the <lb/>
            subject is such as it is in reality, but deceives it by its artifice, <lb/>
            thrusting that, in which there is no advantage, into the class of <lb/>
            things profitable.</p>
          <p>For as we may at times see ill-looking courtezans dyeing <lb/>
            and painting their faces in order to conceal the plainness of <lb/>
            their countenances, so also may we see the intemperate man <lb/>
            acting who is inclined to the pleasures of the belly. He looks <lb/>
             <pb n="124"/>
            upon great abundance of wine and a luxurious store of food as <lb/>
            a good thing, though he is injured by them both in his body <lb/>
            and in his soul. Again, we may often see lovers madly eager <lb/>
            to be loved by the ugliest of women, because pleasure deceives <lb/>
            them and all but affirms positively to them that beauty of <lb/>
            form, and delicacy of complexion, and healthiness of flesh, <lb/>
            and symmetry of limb, exists in those who have the exact <lb/>
            contraries to all these qualifications. Accordingly, they over­ <lb/>
            look those who are truly possessed of perfectly irreproachable <lb/>
            beauty, and waste away with love for such creatures as I have <lb/>
            mentioned. Every kind of deceit therefore is closely con­ <lb/>
            nected with pleasure ; and every kind of gift with the outward <lb/>
            sense: for the one bewilders the mind with sophistry and <lb/>
            misleads it, representing to it anything that comes before it, <lb/>
            not in the character which really belongs to it, but in one that <lb/>
            does not. But the outward sense presents bodies, plainly as <lb/>
            they are according to their real nature, without any device or <lb/>
            artifice.</p>
          <p>XXI. " And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because <lb/>
            thou hast done this thing, thou art cursed above all cattle and <lb/>
            every beast of the field ; upon thy breast and upon thy belly <lb/>
            shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. <lb/>
            And I will put enmity in the midst between thee and between <lb/>
            the woman, and in the midst between thy seed and between <lb/>
            her seed, He shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise <lb/>
            his heel."* What is the reason why he curses the serpent <lb/>
            without allowing him to make any defence, when in another <lb/>
            place he commands that " both the parties between whom <lb/>
            there is any dispute shall be heard,"t and that one shall not be <lb/>
            believed till the other has been heard ? And indeed in this <lb/>
            case you see that he did not give a prejudged belief to Adam's <lb/>
            statement against his wife ; but he gave her also an oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity of defending herself, when he asked her, " Why hast <lb/>
            thou done this?" But she confessed that she had erred <lb/>
            through the deceitfulness of serpent-like and diversified plea­ <lb/>
            sure. Why, therefore, when the woman had said, " The <lb/>
            serpent deceived me,"t did he forbid the putting of the question <lb/>
            to the serpent whether it was he who had thus deceived her ; <lb/>
            and why did he thus appoint him to be condemned without <lb/>
            trial and without defence ? <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xix. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Genesis ii. 13. </note> <pb n="125"/>
            </p>
          <p>We must say, therefore, that the external senses are not a <lb/>
            a peculiar property of either bad or good men, but that they <lb/>
            are of an intermediate nature, and common to both the wise <lb/>
            man and the fool, and when they are found in the fool, they <lb/>
            are bad; but when they are found in the wise man, they are <lb/>
            good. Very naturally therefore, since it has a nature which <lb/>
            is not necessarily and intrinsically evil, but one which being <lb/>
            capable of either character, inclines at different times and <lb/>
            under different circumstances towards either extremity, it is <lb/>
            not condemned till it has itself confessed that it followed the <lb/>
            worse inclination. But the serpent, that is pleasure, is of <lb/>
            itself evil. On this account it is absolutely not found at all <lb/>
            in the virtuous man; but the wicked man alone enjoys it. <lb/>
            Very properly therefore does God curse it before it has time to <lb/>
            make any defence, inasmuch as it has no seed of virtue within <lb/>
            it, but is at all times and in all places blameable and <lb/>
            polluting.</p>
          <p>XXII. On this account also, God " saw that Er was <lb/>
            wicked,"* without any apparent cause for this judgment of <lb/>
            his character, and he slew him. For God is not unaware <lb/>
            that that leathern mass which covers us, namely, the body; <lb/>
            for Er being interpreted means leather, is an evil thing, and <lb/>
            one which plots against the soul, and which is at all times <lb/>
            lifeless and dead. For what else does he compel any one of <lb/>
            us to do but to carry about a dead body, our soul raising up <lb/>
            the body which as far as its own nature goes is dead, and <lb/>
            bearing it almost without difficulty? And just consider, if you <lb/>
            will, the great energy of the soul, for the most vigorous <lb/>
            athlete would not be able to carry about a statue of himself <lb/>
            for even a short time ; but the soul, without any exertion and <lb/>
            without any fatigue, carries about the statue of a man occa­ <lb/>
            sionally even for as long a time as a hundred years; for even <lb/>
            at the end of that period it does not kill it, but only gets rid <lb/>
            of a body which was dead from the beginning. And it is evil <lb/>
            by nature, as I have said before, and a thing which plots <lb/>
            against the soul, but which is not visible to all men, but only <lb/>
            to God, and to such men as are friends to God. " For the <lb/>
            wicked Er," says Moses, " was an enemy of the Lord."</p>
          <p>For when the mind busies itself with sublime contem­ <lb/>
            plations, and becomes initiated into the mysteries of the Lord, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxviii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="126"/>
            it judges the body to be a wicked and hostile thing; but when <lb/>
            it abandons its investigations of divine things, it then looks <lb/>
            upon the body as something friendly, and belonging to and <lb/>
            nearly akin to itself; and accordingly it flies to the things <lb/>
            which are dear to it. On this account the soul of the athlete <lb/>
            and the soul of the philosopher differ; for the athlete attri • <lb/>
            butes all his importance to the good condition of his body, and <lb/>
            would throw away his soul itself in the cause of his body, as <lb/>
            being a man devoted to his body; but the philosopher, being <lb/>
            a lover of what is'virtuous, cares for that which is alive within <lb/>
            him, namely his soul, and disregards his body which is dead, <lb/>
            having no other object but to prevent the most excellent <lb/>
            portion of him, namely his soul, from being injured by the evil <lb/>
            and dead thing which is connected with it.</p>
          <p>XXIII. You see that it is not the Lord who is here spoken <lb/>
            of as slaying Er, but God. For he does not kill the body <lb/>
            in respect of the absolute and irresponsible power which he <lb/>
            possesses, and by which he rules and governs the universe, but in <lb/>
            respect of that authority which he possesses in consequence of <lb/>
            his goodness and excellence, for God is the name of goodness, <lb/>
            the cause of all things ; that you may understand that he also <lb/>
            created all inanimate things, not by his authority, but by his <lb/>
            goodness, by which also he created all living things; for it <lb/>
            was requisite for the manifestation of the better things, that <lb/>
            there should also be a subordinate creation of the inferior <lb/>
            things, through the power of the same goodness which was the <lb/>
            cause of all, which is God. When, then, 0 Soul ! shall you <lb/>
            most especially consider that you have gained a victory? <lb/>
            Will it not be when you are made perfect, and when you have <lb/>
            been thought worthy,of decisions in your favour and of crowns ? <lb/>
            For then you will be a lover of God, not of the body, and <lb/>
            you will receive prizes, inasmuch as your wife shall be Thamar <lb/>
            the bride of Judah, and Thamar being interpreted means the <lb/>
            palm-tree, the symbol of victory. And a proof of this is, that <lb/>
            when Er married her, he was at once discovered to be a wicked <lb/>
            man, and was slain ; for Moses says, " And Judah took a <lb/>
            wife for Er, his first-born soil, whose name was Thamar; " and <lb/>
            immediately afterwards he adds, " And Er was a wicked man <lb/>
            before the Lord, and God slew him ;” for when the mind <lb/>
            has carried off the prize of virtue, it condemns the dead body <lb/>
            to death.</p><pb n="127"/>
            
          <p>You see that God also curses the serpent without allowing <lb/>
            it to make any defence, for it is pleasure : and so also he slays <lb/>
            Er without any visible cause being alleged, for Er is the <lb/>
            body. And if you consider, 0 good friend, you will find that <lb/>
            God has created in the soul some natural qualities which are <lb/>
            in themselves faulty and blameless, and also in every soul <lb/>
            some which are virtuous and praiseworthy, as is the case <lb/>
            likewise with plants and animals. Do you not see that the <lb/>
            Creator has made some plants capable of cultivation and <lb/>
            useful and salutary, and others incapable of cultivation, wild, <lb/>
            pernicious, the causes of diseases and destruction; and ani­ <lb/>
            mals too of similar variety of character, as beyond all question <lb/>
            is the serpent, of which we are now speaking; for he is a <lb/>
            destructive and deadly animal by his intrinsic nature. And <lb/>
            as the serpent affects man, so does pleasure too affect the soul; <lb/>
            in reference to which fact the serpent has been compared to <lb/>
            pleasure.</p>
          <p>XXIV. As, therefore, God hates pleasure and the body <lb/>
            without any especial cause, so also does he give pre-eminent <lb/>
            honour to virtuous natures without any visible cause; not <lb/>
            alleging any action of theirs before the praises of them which <lb/>
            he utters. For if any one were to ask why Moses says that <lb/>
            " Noah found grace before the Lord God,"* without having <lb/>
            previously done any good thing, as far at least as we know, <lb/>
            we shall be very properly answered, that he was proved to be <lb/>
            a praiseworthy character and order of creation ; for the name <lb/>
            Noah, being interpreted, means rest, or just: and it follows <lb/>
            of necessity that one who is resting from acts of injustice and <lb/>
            from sins, and who, so resting, lives with virtue and justice, <lb/>
            must find grace before God; and to find grace, is not only, as <lb/>
            some call it, equivalent to the expression " pleasing God," but <lb/>
            it has some such meaning as this.</p>
          <p>The just man seeking to understand the nature of all exist­ <lb/>
            ing things, makes this one most excellent discovery, that <lb/>
            everything which exists, does so according to the grace of <lb/>
            God, and that there is nothing ever given by, just as there <lb/>
            is nothing possessed by, the things of creation. On which <lb/>
            account also it is proper to acknowledge gratitude to the Crea­ <lb/>
            tor alone. Accordingly, to those persons who seek to investi­ <lb/>
            gate what is the origin of creation, we may most correctly <note type="footnote"> 0 Genesis vi. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="128"/>
            make answer, that it is the goodness and the grace of God, <lb/>
            which he has bestowed on the human race; for all the things <lb/>
            which are in the world, and the world itself, are the gift and <lb/>
            benefaction and free grace of God.</p>
          <p>.XXV. Moreover, God made Melchisedek, the king of peace, <lb/>
            that is of Salem, for that is the interpretation of this name, <lb/>
            "his own high priest,"* without having previously mentioned <lb/>
            any particular action of his, but merely because he had made <lb/>
            him a king, and a lover of peace, and especially worthy of his <lb/>
            priesthood. For he is called a just king, and a king is the <lb/>
            opposite of a tyrant, because the one is the interpreter of law, <lb/>
            and the other of lawlessness. Therefore the tyrannical mind <lb/>
            imposes violent and mischievous commands on both soul and <lb/>
            body, and such as have a tendency to cause violent suffering, <lb/>
            being commands to act according to vice, and to indulge the <lb/>
            passions with enjoyment. But the other, the kingly mind, in <lb/>
            the first place, does not command, but rather persuades, since <lb/>
            it gives recommendations of such a character, that if guided <lb/>
            by them, life, like a vessel, will enjoy a fair voyage through <lb/>
            life, being directed in its course by a good governor and pilot; <lb/>
            and this good pilot is right reason. We may therefore call <lb/>
            the tyrannical mind the ruler of war, and the kingly mind the <lb/>
            guide to peace, that is Salem.</p>
          <p>And this kingly mind shall bring forth food full of cheerful­ <lb/>
            ness and joy; for " he brought forth bread and wine," which <lb/>
            the Ammonites and Moabites were not willing to give to the <lb/>
            beholder, that is Israel; by reason of such unwillingness they <lb/>
            are shut out from the companionship and assembly of Grod. <lb/>
            For the Ammonites being they who are sprung from the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense of the mother, and the Moabites, who originate in <lb/>
            the mind of the father, are two different dispositions, which <lb/>
            look upon the mind and the outward sense as the efficient <lb/>
            causes of all existing things, but take no notice of God. <lb/>
            Therefore they shall not come," says Moses, into the <lb/>
            assembly of the Lord, because they did not come to meet you <lb/>
            with bread and water when you came out of Egypt,"t that is, <lb/>
            out of the passions.</p>
          <p>XXVI. But Melchisedek shall bring forward wine instead <lb/>
            of water, and shall give your souls to drink, and shall cheer <lb/>
            them with unmixed wine, in order that they may be wholly <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="129"/>
            occupied with a divine intoxication, more sober than sobriety <lb/>
            itself. For reason is a priest, having, as its inheritance the <lb/>
            true God, and entertaining lofty and sublime and magnificent <lb/>
            ideas about him, " for he is the priest of the most high <lb/>
            God."* Not that there is any other God who is not the most <lb/>
            high; for God being one, is in the heaven above, and in the <lb/>
            earth beneath, and there is no other besides him.”† But he <lb/>
            sets in motion the notion of the Most High, from his conceiving <lb/>
            of God not in a low and grovelling spirit, but in one of ex­ <lb/>
            ceeding greatness, and exceeding sublimity, apart from any <lb/>
            conceptions of matter.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And what good thing had Abraham done as yet <lb/>
            when God called him and bade him become a stranger to his <lb/>
            country and to this " generation," and to dwell in the land <lb/>
            which the Lord should give him?‡ And that is a good and <lb/>
            populous city, and one of great happiness. For the gifts of <lb/>
            God are great and honourable. But he made this position of <lb/>
            Abraham also to be typical, containing an emblem worthy of <lb/>
            attentive consideration. For Abraham, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means " Lofty Father ;"§ a title of admiration in both its divi­ <lb/>
            sions. For when the mind does not, like a master, threaten the <lb/>
            soul, but rather guides it, like a father, not indulging it in <lb/>
            the pleasant things, but giving it what is expedient for it, even <lb/>
            against its will, and also turning it away from all lowly things <lb/>
            and such as lead it to mortal paths, it leads it to sublime con­ <lb/>
            templations and makes it dwell amid speculations on the world <lb/>
            and its constituent parts. And, moreover, mounting up higher, <lb/>
            it investigates the Deity itself, and his nature, through an un­ <lb/>
            speakable lore of knowledge, in consequence of which it cannot <lb/>
            be content to abide in the original decrees, but, being improved <lb/>
            I itself, becomes also desirous of removing to a better habitation.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But there are some persons whom, even before <lb/>
            their creation, God creates and disposes excellently; respecting <lb/>
            whom he determines beforehand that they shall have a most <lb/>
            excellent inheritance. Do you not see what he says about <lb/>
            Isaac to Abraham, when he had no hope of any such thing, <lb/>
            namely, that he should become the father of such an offspring, <lb/>
            but did rather laugh at the promise, and asked, " Shall a son <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 18 </note><note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy iv. 39. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xii.l. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Or, " Father of a great multitude,' according to the marginal <lb/>
            translation in the bible. </note> <note type="footnote"> K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="130"/>
            be born to me, who am a hundred years old; and shall Sarah, <lb/>
            who is ninety years old, bring forth a child ?"* But God <lb/>
            asserts it positively, and ratifies his promise saying, " Yea, <lb/>
            behold Sarah, thy wife; shall bear theea son, and thou shalt <lb/>
            call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant towards <lb/>
            him for an everlasting covenant.”</p>
          <p>What then is the reason which caused this man, also, to be <lb/>
            praised before his birth ? There are some good things which <lb/>
            are an advantage to a man both when they are past, and when <lb/>
            they are present, such as good health, a sound condition of <lb/>
            the outward senses, riches, if he be endowed with them, a <lb/>
            good reputation; for all these things may, by a slight perver­ <lb/>
            sion of words, be called good things. But some are so not <lb/>
            merely when they have been given to us, but even when it is <lb/>
            predicted that they shall be so given, as joy is a good affection <lb/>
            of the soul; for this does not cheer a man only when it is <lb/>
            present and energises actively in him, but it delights him also <lb/>
            by anticipations when it is hoped for-for it has this especial <lb/>
            quality ; all other good qualities have their own separate opera­ <lb/>
            tion and effect, but joy is both a separate good and a common <lb/>
            good, for it comes as a crowning one after all the rest-for we <lb/>
            feel joy at good health, and we feel joy at liberty and at honour, <lb/>
            and at all other such things, so that one may say with propriety <lb/>
            that there is not one single good thing which has not the addi­ <lb/>
            tional good of joy. But not only do we rejoice at other good <lb/>
            things which are already previously past and also at those which <lb/>
            are present, but we rejoice also at good things when about to <lb/>
            happen to us and expected; as for instance, when we hope <lb/>
            that we shall become rich, or that we shall obtain power, or that <lb/>
            we shall receive praise, or that we shall find a means to get rid <lb/>
            of an illness, or that we shall acquire vigour and strength, or <lb/>
            that we shall become learned instead of ignorant, in all these <lb/>
            cases we are rejoiced in no slight degree.</p>
          <p>Since, then, joy diffuses itself over and cheers the soul, not <lb/>
            only while it is present but also even when it is expected, <lb/>
            it was very consistent and natural for God to think Isaac <lb/>
            worthy of a good name and of a great gift before he was born, <lb/>
            for the name of Isaac, being interpreted, means laughter of <lb/>
            soul, and delight, and joy.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Again, they say that Jacob and Esau, the former <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="131"/>
            being the ruler, and governor, and master, and Esau being the <lb/>
            subject and the slave, had their several estates appointed to <lb/>
            them while they were still in the world. For God, the creator <lb/>
            of all living things, is thoroughly acquainted with all his works, <lb/>
            and before he has completely finished them he comprehends <lb/>
            the faculties with which they will hereafter be endowed, and <lb/>
            altogether he foreknows all their actions and passions. For <lb/>
            when Rebecca, that is the patient soul, proceeds to ask an <lb/>
            oracle from God, the answers are, " Two nations are in thy <lb/>
            womb, and two people shall come forth from thy bowels, and <lb/>
            one people shall be stronger than the other people, and the <lb/>
            elder shall save the younger."* For that which is wicked and <lb/>
            void of reason is, by its own nature, a slave in the eye of God ; <lb/>
            but that which is good and endowed with reason and better, is <lb/>
            looked upon as powerful and free by him. And this is the <lb/>
            case not only when each of these two different characters is per <lb/>
            feet in the soul, but when there is a doubt on the subject; for, <lb/>
            altogether, a slight breeze of virtue shows power and supre­ <lb/>
            macy, and not freedom only, and on the other hand, the <lb/>
            existence of even an ordinary degree of vice enslaves the reason, <lb/>
            even though not by any means as yet come to maturity.</p>
          <p>XXX. Again, why did the same Jacob when Joseph brought <lb/>
            him his two sons, the elder being Manasses and the younger <lb/>
            Ephraim, change his hands, and put his right hand upon the <lb/>
            younger brother Ephraim, and his left hand upon the elder <lb/>
            brother Manasses ? And when Joseph thought this a grievous <lb/>
            thing, and thought that his father had unintentionally made a <lb/>
            mistake in the matter of the imposition of hands, Jacob said, <lb/>
            " I did not make a mistake, but I knew, my son, I knew that <lb/>
            this one should be a father of a nation, and should be exalted; <lb/>
            but, nevertheless, his younger brother shall be greater than <lb/>
            he.''t What, then, must we say but this ? That two natures, <lb/>
            both utterly necessary, were created in the soul by God, one <lb/>
            memory and the other recollection, of which memory is the best <lb/>
            and recollection the worst. For the one has its perceptions <lb/>
            fresh and harmonious and clear, so that it never errs through <lb/>
            ignorance. But forgetfulness does, in every case, precede re­ <lb/>
            collection, which is but a mutilated and blind thing. And, <lb/>
            although recollection is worse, it is nevertheless older than <lb/>
            memory, which is better than it, and is also conjoined with and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxv. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlviii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="132"/>
            inseparable from it; for when we are first introduced to any <lb/>
            art we are unable at once to make ourselves masters of all the <lb/>
            speculations which bear upon it. Being, therefore, affected <lb/>
            with forgetfulness at first, we subsequently recollect, until from <lb/>
            a frequent recurrence of forgetfulness and a frequent recurrence <lb/>
            of recollection, memory at last prevails in us in a lasting manner. <lb/>
            On which account it is younger than recollection, for it is later <lb/>
            in its existence.</p>
          <p>And Ephraim is a symbolical name, being, to be interpreted, <lb/>
            memory. For, being interpreted, it means the fertility of the <lb/>
            soul of the man fond of learning, which brings forth its appro­ <lb/>
            priate fruit when it has confirmed its speculations, and preserves <lb/>
            them in its memory. But Manasses, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            recollection, for he is spoken of as one who has been translated <lb/>
            from forgetfulness, and he who escapes from forgetfulness <lb/>
            does unquestionably recollect. Most correctly, therefore, does <lb/>
            that supplanter of the passions and practiser of virtue, Jacob, <lb/>
            give his right hand to that prolific memory, Ephraim, while he <lb/>
            places Manasses, or recollection, in the second rank. And, <lb/>
            Moses, also, of all those who sacrificed the passover, praised <lb/>
            those who sacrificed first most, because they having crossed over <lb/>
            from the passions, that is to say, from Egypt, remained by the <lb/>
            passage, and did not hasten any more to the passions which they <lb/>
            had quitted ; and the others he also thinks worthy to be placed <lb/>
            in the second rank, for, having turned back, they retraced <lb/>
            their steps, and, as if they had forgotten what it became them <lb/>
            to do, they again hastened to do the same things ; but the former <lb/>
            men continued in their course without turning back. There­ <lb/>
            fore, Manasses, who is born of forgetfulness, resembles those <lb/>
            who were the second party to sacrifice the passover; but the <lb/>
            fertile Ephraim is like those who had sacrificed previously.</p>
          <p>XXXI. On which account God also calls Bezaleel by name, <lb/>
            and says that " He will give him wisdom and knowledge, and <lb/>
            that He will make him the builder and the architect of all the <lb/>
            things which are in his tabernacle that is to say, of all the <lb/>
            works of the soul, when he had up to this time done no work <lb/>
            which anyone could praise—we must say, therefore, that God <lb/>
            impressed this figure also on the soul, after the fashion of an <lb/>
            approved coin. And we shall know what the impression is if <lb/>
            we previously examine the interpretation of the name. Now, <note type="footnote"> it Exodus xxxi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="133"/>
            Bezaleel, being interpreted, means God in his shadow. But <lb/>
            the shadow of God is his word, which he used like an in­ <lb/>
            strument when he was making the world. And this shadow, <lb/>
            and, as it were, model, is the archetype of other things. For, <lb/>
            as God is himself the model of that image which he has now <lb/>
            called a shadow, so also that image is the model of other <lb/>
            things, as he showed when he commenced giving the law to the <lb/>
            Israelites, and said, " And God made man according to the <lb/>
            image of God,"* as the image was modelled according to <lb/>
            God, and as man was modelled according to the image, which <lb/>
            thus received the power and character of the model.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Let us now, then, examine what the character <lb/>
            which is impressed upon man is. The ancient philosophers used <lb/>
            to inquire how we obtained our conceptions of the Deity? <lb/>
            Men who, those who seemed to philosophise in the most excel­ <lb/>
            lent manner, said that from the world and from its several parts, <lb/>
            and from the powers which existed in those parts, we formed <lb/>
            our notions of the Creator and cause of the world. For as, if a <lb/>
            man were to see a house carefully built and well provided with <lb/>
            outer courts and porticoes, and men's chambers and women's <lb/>
            chambers, and all other necessary apartments, he would form a <lb/>
            notion of the architect; for he would never suppose that the <lb/>
            house had been completed without skill and without a builder; <lb/>
            and, as he would argue in the same manner respecting any <lb/>
            city, or any ship, or anything whatever that is made, whether <lb/>
            it be great or small, so likewise any one entering this world, as <lb/>
            an exceedingly large house or large city, and seeing the heaven <lb/>
            revolving round it in a circle and comprehending everything <lb/>
            within it, and all the planets and fixed stars moving onwards in <lb/>
            the same manner and on the same principles, all in regular <lb/>
            order and in due harmony and in such a manner as is most <lb/>
            advantageous for the whole created universe, and the earth <lb/>
            stationed in the central situation, and the effusions of air and <lb/>
            water fixed on the boundaries, and, moreover, all the animals, <lb/>
            both mortal and immortal, and the different kinds of plants and <lb/>
            fruits, he will surely consider that undoubtedly all these things <lb/>
            were not made without skill, but that God both was and is the <lb/>
            creator of this whole universe. They, then, who draw their <lb/>
            conclusions in this manner perceive God in his shadow, arriving <lb/>
            at a due comprehension of the artist through his works. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 26. </note> <pb n="134"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXXIII. There is also a more perfect and more highly <lb/>
            purified kind which has been initiated into the great mysteries, <lb/>
            and which does not distinguish the cause from the things <lb/>
            created as it would distinguish an abiding body from a shadow; <lb/>
            but which, having emerged from all created objects, receives a <lb/>
            clear and manifest notion of the great uncreated, so that it com­ <lb/>
            prehends him through himself, and comprehends his shadow, <lb/>
            too, so as to understand what it is, and his reason, too, and <lb/>
            this universal world. This kind is that Moses, who speaks <lb/>
            thus, " Show thyself to me; let me see thee so as to know <lb/>
            thee,"* for do not thou be manifested to me through the <lb/>
            medium of the heaven, or of the earth, or of water, or of air, or, <lb/>
            in short, of anything whatever of created things, and let me not <lb/>
            see thy appearance in any other thing, as in a looking-glass, <lb/>
            except in thee thyself, the true God. For the images which <lb/>
            are presented to the sight in executed things are subject to dis­ <lb/>
            solution ; but those which are presented in the One uncreate <lb/>
            may last for ever, being durable, eternal, and unchangeable.</p>
          <p>On this account " God called Moses to him and conversed <lb/>
            with him,"t and he also called Bezaleel to him, though not in <lb/>
            the same way as he had called Moses, but lie called the one so <lb/>
            that he might receive an idea of the appearance of God from <lb/>
            the Creator himself, but the other so that he might by cal­ <lb/>
            culation form an idea of the Creator as if from the shadow of <lb/>
            the things created. On this account you will find the taber­ <lb/>
            nacle and all its furniture to have been made in the first <lb/>
            instance by Moses, and again subsequently by Bezaleel. For <lb/>
            Moses fashioned the archetypal forms, and Bezaleel made the <lb/>
            imitations of them. For Moses had God himself for an in­ <lb/>
            structor, as he tells us, when he represents God as saying to <lb/>
            him, "Thou shall make every thing according to the example <lb/>
            which was shown thee in the Mount.”‡ And Bezaleel had <lb/>
            Moses for his instructor; and this was very natural. For <lb/>
            Aaron the word, and Miriam the outward sense, when they rose <lb/>
            up against Moses were expressly told that "If there shall <lb/>
            arise a prophet to the Lord, God shall be made known to him <lb/>
            in a vision, and in a shadow, but not clearly. § But with <lb/>
            Moses, who is faithful in all his house, God will speak mouth <lb/>
            to mouth in his own form, and not by riddles." <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxv. 40. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxv. 30. </note><note type="footnote"> § Numbers xii. 6. </note> <pb n="135"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXXIV. Since therefore we find that there are two natures <lb/>
            which have been created and fashioned and accurately and <lb/>
            skilfully framed by God; the one being in its own intrinsic <lb/>
            nature pernicious and open to reproach, and accursed, and the <lb/>
            the other beneficial and praiseworthy, the one too having a <lb/>
            spurious stamp upon it, but the other having undergone a <lb/>
            strict test; we will utter a beautiful and suitable prayer which <lb/>
            Moses also addressed to God, praying that God may open his <lb/>
            treasurehouse, and may lay before us his sublime word pregnant <lb/>
            with divine lights, which he calls the heaven, and may bind <lb/>
            fast the storehouses of evil. For, just as there are storehouses <lb/>
            of good things so are there also storehouses of evil things with <lb/>
            God; as he says in his great song, " Behold are not these <lb/>
            things collected with me, and sealed up in my treasurehouses, <lb/>
            against the day of vengeance when their foot shall be tripped <lb/>
            up ?</p>
          <p>You see then that there are several storehouses of evil things, <lb/>
            and only one of good things. For since God is One, so also is <lb/>
            his storehouse of good things one likewise. But there are <lb/>
            many storehouses of evil things because the wicked are in­ <lb/>
            finite in number. And in this observe the goodness of the <lb/>
            true God, He opens the treasurehouse of his good things freely, <lb/>
            but he binds fast that which contains the evil things. For it <lb/>
            is an especial property of God to offer his good things freely <lb/>
            and to be beforehand with men in bestowing gifts upon them. <lb/>
            but to be slow in bringing evil on them, and Moses dwelling <lb/>
            at length upon the munificent and gracious nature of God, <lb/>
            says that not only have his storehouses of evil things been <lb/>
            sealed up in all other times, but also when the soul is tripped <lb/>
            up in the path of right reason, when it is especially fair that <lb/>
            it should be considered worthy of punishment; for he says <lb/>
            that, “ In the day of vengeance the storehouses of evil things <lb/>
            have been sealed up," the sacred word of scripture showing <lb/>
            that God does not visit with his vengeance even those who <lb/>
            sin against him, immediately, but that he gives them time for <lb/>
            repentance, and to remedy and correct their evil conduct.</p>
          <p>XXXV. And the Lord God said to the serpent, "Thou <lb/>
            art cursed over every creature and over all the beasts of the <lb/>
            field." As joy being a good state of the passions is worthy to be <lb/>
            prayed for; so also pleasure is worthy to be cursed being a <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 34. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="136"/>
            passion, which has altered the boundaries of the soul, and has <lb/>
            rendered it a lover of the passions instead of a lover of virtue. <lb/>
            And Moses says in his curses, that " He is cursed who re­ <lb/>
            moves his neighbour's land mark,''* for God placed virtue, <lb/>
            that is to say, the tree of life, to be a land mark, and a law <lb/>
            unto the soul. But pleasure has removed this, placing in its <lb/>
            stead the land mark of vice, the tree of death, " Cursed <lb/>
            indeed is he who causeth the blind man to wander in the <lb/>
            road." This also is done by that most impious tiling pleasure, <lb/>
            for the outward sense, inasmuch as it is destitute of reason, <lb/>
            is a thing blinded by nature, since the eyes of its reason are <lb/>
            put out. In reference to which we may say that it is by <lb/>
            reason alone that we attain to a comprehension of things, and <lb/>
            no longer by the outward sense; for they are bodies alone <lb/>
            that we acquire a conception of by means of the outward <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>Pleasure therefore has deceived the outward sense which is <lb/>
            destitute of any proper comprehension of things, inasmuch as <lb/>
            though it might have been turned to the mind, and have been <lb/>
            guided by it, it has hindered it from being so, leading it to <lb/>
            the external objects of outward sense, and making it desirous <lb/>
            of every thing which can call it into operation, in order that <lb/>
            the outward sense being defective may follow a blind guide. <lb/>
            namely the object of the outward sense, and then the mind <lb/>
            being guided by the two things, which are themselves both <lb/>
            blind, may plunge headlong to destruction and become utterly <lb/>
            unable to restrain itself. For if it were to follow its natural <lb/>
            guide then it would be proper for defective things to follow <lb/>
            reason which sees clearly, for in that way mischievous things <lb/>
            would be less formidable in their attacks. But now, pleasure <lb/>
            has put such great artifices in operation to injure the soul, <lb/>
            that it has compelled it to use them as guides, cheating it, and <lb/>
            persuading it to exchange virtue for evil habits, and to give <lb/>
            good habits in exchange for vice.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. But the holy scripture has prohibited such an <lb/>
            exchange as this when it says, "Thou shalt not exchange good <lb/>
            for evil”† On this account therefore pleasure is accursed, <lb/>
            and let us now see how well adapted to it are the curses <lb/>
            which the scripture denounces against it, "Thou shalt be <lb/>
            cursed" says God, " above all creatures." Therefore, the <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxvii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Leviticus xxvii. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="137"/>
            whole race of animals is irrational and under the guidance <lb/>
            only of the external senses; but every one of the outward <lb/>
            senses curses pleasure as a most inimical and hostile thing to <lb/>
            it; for it is in reality hostile to the outward senses. And the <lb/>
            proof of this is that, when we are sated with an immoderate <lb/>
            indulgence in pleasure, we are not able either to see, or to <lb/>
            hear, or to smell, or to taste, or to touch with any clearness of <lb/>
            our faculties, but we make all our essays and approaches in an <lb/>
            obscure and imbecile manner. And this happens to us when <lb/>
            we are for a moment at a distance from its infection ; but at <lb/>
            the exact moment of the enjoyment of pleasure we are com­ <lb/>
            pletely deprived of all such perception as can arise from the <lb/>
            operation of the outward senses, so that we seem to be <lb/>
            mutilated. How then can it be anything but natural for the <lb/>
            outward sense to denounce curses upon pleasure which thus <lb/>
            deprives it of its faculties.?</p>
          <p>XXXVII. " And he is accursed beyond all the beasts of the <lb/>
            field." And I mean by this, beyond all the passions of the <lb/>
            soul, for it is only there that the mind is wounded and <lb/>
            destroyed. Why then does this one appear to be worse than <lb/>
            all the other passions ? Because it is almost at the bottom of <lb/>
            them all, as a sort of base or foundation for them, for desire <lb/>
            originates in the love of pleasure, and pain consists in the <lb/>
            removal of pleasure ; and fear again is caused by a desire to <lb/>
            guard against its absence. So it is plain that all the passions <lb/>
            are anchored on pleasure ; and perhaps one might say that they <lb/>
            would absolutely have had no existence at all if pleasure had <lb/>
            not been previously laid down as a foundation to support them.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. " Upon thy breast and upon thy belly shalt <lb/>
            thou go.”* For passion works around these parts, the breast <lb/>
            and the belly, like a serpent in his hole ; when pleasure has <lb/>
            its efficient causes and its subject-matter, then it is in operation <lb/>
            around the belly and the parts adjacent to the belly; and <lb/>
            when it has not these efficient causes and this subject-matter, <lb/>
            then it is occupied about the breast which is the seat of anger, <lb/>
            for lovers of pleasure when deprived of their pleasures become <lb/>
            embittered by their anger. But let us see what is shown by <lb/>
            this sentence with greater accuracy. It so happens that our <lb/>
            soul is divisible into three parts, and that one of its parts is the <lb/>
            seat of reason, the second, the seat of courage, the third, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 14 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="138"/>
            seat of the appetites. Some therefore of the philosophers <lb/>
            have separated these parts from one another only in respect of <lb/>
            their operations, and some have distinguished them also by <lb/>
            their places. And then they have assigned the parts about <lb/>
            the head to the residing part, saying where the king is, there <lb/>
            also are his guards, and the guards of the mind are the <lb/>
            external senses, which are seated about the head, so that the <lb/>
            king may very naturally have his abode there too, as if he had <lb/>
            been assigned the highest part of the city to dwell in. The <lb/>
            chest is assigned to the courageous part, and they say, it is on <lb/>
            this account, that nature has fortified that part with a dense <lb/>
            and strong defence of closely conjoined bones, as though she <lb/>
            had been arming a valiant soldier with a breastplate and shield <lb/>
            to defend himself against his enemies. To the appetitive part <lb/>
            they have assigned a situation about, the liver and the belly, <lb/>
            for there it is that appetite dwells, being an irrational desire.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. If therefore you shall ever inquire, 0 my mind, <lb/>
            what situation has been assigned to pleasure, do not take into <lb/>
            your consideration the parts about the head, where the <lb/>
            reasoning faculties of man have their abode, for you will not <lb/>
            find it there; since reason is at war with passion, and cannot <lb/>
            possibly remain in the same place with it. For the moment <lb/>
            that reason gets the upper hand pleasure is discarded ; but as <lb/>
            soon as ever pleasure prevails, reason is put to flight. But <lb/>
            seek first rather in the breast and in the belly, where courage <lb/>
            and anger, and appetite abide, all which are parts of the <lb/>
            irrational faculties. For it is there that our judgment is <lb/>
            discovered, and also our passions. Therefore, the mind is not <lb/>
            hindered by any external force from abandoning the legitimate <lb/>
            objects of its attention, which can only be perceived by the <lb/>
            intellect, and surrendering itself to those which are worse; <lb/>
            but still this never happens except when there is a war in the <lb/>
            soul, for then indeed it follows of necessity that reason must <lb/>
            fall under the power of the inferior part of man, inasmuch as <lb/>
            it is not of a warlike character, but is fond of peace.</p>
          <p>XL. At all events the holy scripture being well aware how <lb/>
            great is the power of the impetuosity of each passion, anger <lb/>
            and appetite, puts a bridle in the mouth of each, having <lb/>
            appointed reason as their charioteer and pilot And first of all <lb/>
            it speaks thus of anger, in the hope of pacifying and curing it; <lb/>
            "And you shall put manifestation and truth (the Urim and <lb/>
             <pb n="139"/>
            the Thummim), in the oracle of judgment, and it shall be on <lb/>
            the breast of Aaron when he comes into the holy place before <lb/>
            the Lord." * Now by the oracle is here meant the organs of <lb/>
            speech which exist in us, which is in fact the power of language. <lb/>
            Now language is either inconsiderate, and such as will not <lb/>
            stand examination, or else it is judicious and well approved, <lb/>
            and it brings us to form a notion of discreet speech. For Moses <lb/>
            here speaks not of a random spurious oracle, but of the oracle <lb/>
            of the judgment, which is equivalent to saying, a well-judged and <lb/>
            carefully examined oracle; and of this well approved kind of <lb/>
            language he says that there are two supreme virtues, namely, <lb/>
            distinctness and truth, and he says well. For it is language <lb/>
            which has in the first place enabled one man to make affairs <lb/>
            plain and evident to his neighbour, when without it we should <lb/>
            not be able to give any intimation of the impression produced <lb/>
            on our soul by outward circumstances, nor to show of what <lb/>
            kind they are.</p>
          <p>XLI On which account we have been compelled to have <lb/>
            recourse to such signs as are given by the voices, that is nouns <lb/>
            and verbs, which ought by all means to be universally known, <lb/>
            in order that our neighbours might clearly and evidently com­ <lb/>
            prebend our meaning; and, in the next place, to utter them at <lb/>
            all times with truth. For of what advantage would it be to <lb/>
            make our assertions clear and distinct, but nevertheless false ? <lb/>
            For it follows inevitably that if this were allowed the hearer <lb/>
            would be deceived, and would reap the greatest possible in­ <lb/>
            jury with ignorance and delusion. For what would be the <lb/>
            advantage of my speaking to a boy distinctly and clearly, and <lb/>
            telling him, when I show him the letter A, that it is G, or that <lb/>
            the letter E is 0 ? Or what would be the good of a musician <lb/>
            pointing out to a pupil who comes to him to learn the rudiments <lb/>
            of his art that the harmonic scale was the chromatic; or the <lb/>
            chromatic, the diatonic; or that the highest string was the <lb/>
            middle one ; or that conjoined sounds were separated ; or that <lb/>
            the highest tone in the tetrachord scale was a supernumerary <lb/>
            note ? No doubt, a man who said this might speak clearly and <lb/>
            distinctly, but he would not be speaking truly, but by such <lb/>
            assertions he would be emplanting wickedness in language. <lb/>
            But when he joins both distinctness and truth, then he makes <lb/>
            his language profitable to him who is seeking information, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxviii. 30. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="140"/>
            employing both its virtues, which in fact are nearly the only <lb/>
            ones of which language is capable.</p>
          <p>'XLII. Moses, therefore, says that discreet discourse, having <lb/>
            its own peculiar virtues, is placed on the breast of Aaron, that <lb/>
            is to say, of anger, in order that it may in the first instance <lb/>
            be guided by reason, and may not be injured by its own defi­ <lb/>
            ciency in reason, and, in the second place, by distinctness, for <lb/>
            there is no natural influence which makes anger a friend to <lb/>
            distinctness. At all events, not only are the ideas of angry <lb/>
            men, but all their expressions also, full of disorder and confu­ <lb/>
            sion, and therefore it is very natural for the want of clearness <lb/>
            on the part of anger to be rectified by clearness, and, in addition, <lb/>
            by truth; for, among other things, anger has also this particular <lb/>
            property of being inclined to misrepresent the truth. At all <lb/>
            events, of all those who give way to this disposition scarcely any <lb/>
            one speaks the strict truth, as if it were his soul and not his body <lb/>
            that is under the influence of its intoxication. These, then, are <lb/>
            the chief remedies suitable for that part of the soul which is <lb/>
            influenced by anger, namely, reason, disinterestedness of <lb/>
            language, and truth of language, for the three things are in <lb/>
            power only one, namely, reason, curing anger, which is a per­ <lb/>
            nicious disease of the soul, by means of the virtues truth and <lb/>
            perspicuity.</p>
          <p>XLIII. To whom, or to what, then, does it belong to bear <lb/>
            these things? Not to my mind, or to that of any chance <lb/>
            person, but to the consecrated and purely sacrificial intellect, <lb/>
            that, namely, of Aaron. And not even to this at all times, for <lb/>
            it is frequently subject to change, but only when it is going on <lb/>
            unchangeably, when it is entering into the holy place, when <lb/>
            reason is entering in together with holy opinions, and is not <lb/>
            abandoning them. But it often happens that the mind is at <lb/>
            the same time entering into sacred and holy and purified <lb/>
            opinions, but still such as are only human ; such, for instance, <lb/>
            as opinions on what is expedient; opinions on successful <lb/>
            actions ; opinions on what is in accordance with established <lb/>
            law; opinions concerning virtue as it exists among men. Nor <lb/>
            is the mind, when disposed in this way, competent to bear the <lb/>
            oracle on its breast together with the virtues, but only that one <lb/>
            which is going in before the Lord, that is to say, that one which <lb/>
            doeth everything for the sake of God, and which estimates no­ <lb/>
            thing as superior to the things of God; but attributes to them <lb/>
             <pb n="141"/>
            also their due rank, not indeed dwelling on them, but ascend­ <lb/>
            ing upwards to the knowledge and understanding of an appre­ <lb/>
            ciation of the honour due to the one God. For, in a mind <lb/>
            which is thus disposed, anger will be directed by purified <lb/>
            reason, which takes away its irrational part, and remedies what <lb/>
            there is confused and disorderly in it by the application of dis­ <lb/>
            tinctness, and eradicates its falsehood by truth.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Aaron, therefore, for he is a second Moses, restrain­ <lb/>
            ing the breast, that is to say, the angry passions, does not allow <lb/>
            them to be carried away by undistinguishing impulse, fearing <lb/>
            lest, if they obtain complete liberty, they may become restiff, <lb/>
            like a horse, and so trample down the whole soul. But he <lb/>
            attends to and cures it, and bridles it in the first instance by <lb/>
            reason, that so, being under the guidance of the best of <lb/>
            charioteers, it may not become exceedingly unmanageable, and <lb/>
            in the second place, by the virtues of language, distinct­ <lb/>
            ness, and truth. For, if the angry passions were educated in <lb/>
            such a way as to yield to reason and distinctness, and to culti­ <lb/>
            vate the virtue of truthfulness, they would deliver themselves <lb/>
            from great irritation and make the whole soul propitious.</p>
          <p>XLV. But he, as I have already said, having this passion, <lb/>
            endeavours to cure it by the saving remedies already enumerated. <lb/>
            But Moses thinks that it is necessary completely to extirpate <lb/>
            and eradicate anger from the soul, being desirous to attain not <lb/>
            to a state of moderation in the indulgence of the passions, but <lb/>
            to a state in which they shall have absolutely no existence <lb/>
            whatever, and the most Holy Scriptures bear witness to what <lb/>
            I am here saying; for it says, " Moses having taken the breast <lb/>
            took it that it might be an offering before the Lord, from the <lb/>
            ram of consecration, and this was Moses's part."* Speaking <lb/>
            very accurately, for it was the conduct of one who was both a <lb/>
            lover of virtue and a lover of God, after having contemplated <lb/>
            the whole soul, to take hold of the breast, which is the seat of <lb/>
            the angry passions, and to take it away and eradicate it, that so <lb/>
            when the warlike part had been wholly removed, the remainder <lb/>
            might enjoy peace. And he removes this part not from any <lb/>
            chance animal, but from the ram of consecration, although, <lb/>
            indeed, a young heifer had been sacrificed; but, passing by the <lb/>
            heifer, he came to the ram, because that is by nature an animal <lb/>
            inclined to pushing and full of anger' and impetuosity, in <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus viii. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="142"/>
            reference to which fact the makers of military engines call many <lb/>
            of their warlike machines rams. This ramlike and impetuous <lb/>
            and undistinguishing character in us, therefore, is something <lb/>
            fond of contention, and, contention is the mother of anger. In <lb/>
            reference to which fact, they who are somewhat quarrelsome are <lb/>
            very easily made angry in investigations and other discussions.</p>
          <p>Moses, therefore, does very properly endeavour to eradicate <lb/>
            anger, that pernicious offspring of a contentious and quarrelsome <lb/>
            soul, in order that the soul may become barren of such offspring <lb/>
            and may cease from bringing forth mischievous things, and may <lb/>
            become a portion consistent with the character of a lover of <lb/>
            virtue, not being identical with either the breast or with anger, <lb/>
            but with the absence of those qualities, for God has endowed <lb/>
            the wise man with the best of all qualities, the power, namely, <lb/>
            of eradicating his passions.</p>
          <p>You see, then, how the perfect man is always endeavouring to <lb/>
            attain to a complete emancipation. from the power of the <lb/>
            passions. But he who eradicates them being next to him, that <lb/>
            is Aaron, labours to arrive at a state in which the passions have <lb/>
            only a moderate power, as I have said before; for he is unable <lb/>
            to eradicate the breast and the angry passions. But he bears <lb/>
            the oracle, on which is distinctness and truth even beyond the <lb/>
            guide himself, together with the appropriate and kindred <lb/>
            virtues of language.</p>
          <p>XLVI. And he will, moreover, make the difference more <lb/>
            evident to us by the following expression :-" For the wave­ <lb/>
            breast and the heave-shoulder have I taken of the children of <lb/>
            Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have <lb/>
            given them to Aaron the priest, and unto his sons, for ever.""' <lb/>
            You see here that they are not able to take the breast alone, <lb/>
            but they must take it with the shoulder; but Moses can take it <lb/>
            without the shoulder. Why is this ? Because he, being per­ <lb/>
            fect, has no inadequate or lowly ideas, nor is he willing to remain <lb/>
            in a state in which the passions have even a moderate influence ; <lb/>
            but he, by his exceeding power, does utterly extirpate the whole <lb/>
            of the passions, root and branch. But the others, who go with <lb/>
            faint endeavours and with but slight strength to war against <lb/>
            the passions, are inclined to a reconciliation with them, and <lb/>
            make terms with them, proposing terms of accommodotion, <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus vii. 34. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="143"/>
            thinking that thus, like a charioteer, they may be able to bridle <lb/>
            their extravagant impetuosity.</p>
          <p>And the shoulder is a symbol of labour and of the endurance <lb/>
            of hardship ; and such a person is he who has the charge of and <lb/>
            the care of administering the holy things, being occupied with <lb/>
            constant exercise and labour. But he has no labour to whom <lb/>
            God has given his perfect good things in great abundance, and <lb/>
            he who attains to virtue by labour will be found to be less <lb/>
            vigorous and less perfect than Moses, who received it as a gift <lb/>
            from God without any labour or difficulty. For the mere fact <lb/>
            of labouring is of itself inferior to and worse than the condition <lb/>
            of being exempt from labour, so, also, what is imperfect is <lb/>
            inferior to that which is perfect, and that which learns anything <lb/>
            to that which has knowledge spontaneously and naturally.</p>
          <p>On this account it is that Aaron can only take the breast with <lb/>
            the shoulder, but Moses can take it without the shoulder. And <lb/>
            he calls it the heave-shoulder for this reason, because reason <lb/>
            ought to be set over and to be predominant above the violence <lb/>
            of anger, as a charioteer who is driving a hard-mouthed and <lb/>
            restiff horse. And then the shoulder is no longer called the <lb/>
            heave-shoulder, but the shoulder of removal, on this account, <lb/>
            because it is fitting that the soul should not attribute to itself <lb/>
            labour in the cause of virtue, but should remove it from itself <lb/>
            and attribute it to God, confessing that it is not its own strength <lb/>
            or its own power which has thus acquired what is good, but He <lb/>
            who gave it a love for goodness. And so neither the breast nor <lb/>
            the shoulder is taken, except from the virtue which bringeth <lb/>
            salvation, as is natural, for then the soul is sacred when the <lb/>
            angry passions are under the guidance of reason, and when <lb/>
            labour does not bring conceit to the labourer, but when he owns <lb/>
            his inferiority to God, his benefactor.</p>
          <p>XLVII. Now that pleasure dwells not only in the breast but <lb/>
            also in the belly, we have already stated, showing that the <lb/>
            belly is the most appropriate situation for pleasure; for we <lb/>
            may almost call pleasure the vessel which contains all the <lb/>
            pleasures ; for when the belly is filled, then the desires for all <lb/>
            other pleasures are intense and vigorous, but when it is empty, <lb/>
            then they are tranquil and steady. On which account Moses <lb/>
            says, in another place, " Every animal that goeth upon its <lb/>
            belly, every animal which goeth on four legs at all times, and <lb/>
             <pb n="144"/>
            that has a multitude of feet, is unclean."* And such a creature <lb/>
            is the lover of pleasure, inasmuch as he is always going upon <lb/>
            his belly and pursuing the pleasures which relate to it. And <lb/>
            God unites the animal which goes on four legs with him that <lb/>
            crawls upon his belly, naturally ; for the passions of those who <lb/>
            are absorbed in pleasure are four, as one most egregious account <lb/>
            teaches. Therefore he who devotes himself as a slave to one <lb/>
            of them, namely, to pleasure, is impure as much as he who <lb/>
            lives in the indulgence of the whole four.</p>
          <p>This much having been premised, behold again the difference <lb/>
            between the perfect man and him who is still advancing towards <lb/>
            perfection. As, therefore, the perfect man was, just now, found <lb/>
            to be competent to eradicate the whole of the angry feelings <lb/>
            from the contentious soul and to make it submissive and man­ <lb/>
            ageable, and peaceable and gentle to every one, both in word <lb/>
            and deed ; and as he who is still advancing towards perfection <lb/>
            is not able wholly to eradicate passion, for he bears the breast <lb/>
            about with him, though he does educate it by the aid of judi­ <lb/>
            cious language, which is invested with two virtues perspicuity <lb/>
            and truth.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. So, also, now he who is perfectly wise, that is, <lb/>
            Moses, will be found to have utterly shaken off and discarded <lb/>
            the pleasures. But he who is only advancing towards perfec­ <lb/>
            tion will be found to have escaped not from every pleasure, but <lb/>
            to cling still to such as are desirable and simple, and to depre­ <lb/>
            cate those which are superfluous and extravagant as unnecessary <lb/>
            additions, for, in the case of Moses, God speaks thus : "And <lb/>
            he washed his belly and his feet, with the blood of the entire <lb/>
            burnt offering."† Speaking very truly, for the wise man <lb/>
            consecrates his entire soul as what is worthy to be offered to <lb/>
            God, because it is free from all reproach, whether wilfully or <lb/>
            unintentionally incorrect, and being thus disposed, he washes <lb/>
            his whole belly and all the pleasures which it knows, and all <lb/>
            which pursue it, and cleanses them and purifies them from all <lb/>
            nncleanliness, not being content with any partial cleansing. But <lb/>
            he is disposed to regard pleasure so contemptuously that he has <lb/>
            no desire for even the necessary meat or drink, but nourishes <lb/>
            himself wholly on the contemplation of divine things. On which <lb/>
            account in another passage, he bears witness to himself, " For <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xi. 42. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Leviticus ix. 14. </note> <lb/>

            forty-eight years he did not eat bread, and he did not drink <lb/>
            water,"* because he was in the holy mount listening to the <lb/>
            oracular voice of God, who was giving him the law.</p>
          <p>But not only does he repudiate the whole belly, but he also <lb/>
            at the same time washes off all the dirt from his feet, that is to <lb/>
            say, to the supports in which pleasure proceeds. And the sup­ <lb/>
            ports of pleasure are the efficient causes of it. For he who is <lb/>
            advancing onwards to perfection is said " to wash his bowels <lb/>
            and his feet,"t and not his whole belly. For he is not capable <lb/>
            of rejecting the whole of pleasure, but he is content if he can <lb/>
            purify his bowels, that is to say, his inmost parts from it, which <lb/>
            the lovers of pleasure say are certain additions to preceding <lb/>
            pleasures, and which originate in the superfluous ingenuity of <lb/>
            cooks and makers of delicacies and laborious gourmands.</p>
          <p>XLIX. And he also displays, in a further degree, the mo­ <lb/>
            deration of the passions of the man who is advancing towards <lb/>
            perfection, by the fact that the perfect mail discards all the <lb/>
            pleasures of the belly without being prompted by any command <lb/>
            to do so, but that he who is only advancing onwards towards <lb/>
            perfection only does so in consequence of being commanded. <lb/>
            For, in the case of the wise man, we find the following expres­ <lb/>
            sion used :—" He washes his belly and his feet with water,"‡ <lb/>
            without any command, in accordance with his own unbidden <lb/>
            inclination. But, in the case of the priests, he spoke thus: <lb/>
            " But their bowels and their feet," not they have washed, but <lb/>
            " they do wash ;"§ speaking with very cautious exactness, <lb/>
            for the perfect man must be moved in his own inclination <lb/>
            towards the energies in accordance with virtue. But he who is <lb/>
            only practising virtue must be instigated by reason, which <lb/>
            points out to him what he ought to do, and it is an honourable <lb/>
            thing to obey the injunctions of reason.</p>
          <p>But we ought not to be ignorant that Moses repudiates the <lb/>
            whole of the belly, that is to say, the filling and indulging the <lb/>
            belly, and almost renounces all the other passions likewise ; the <lb/>
            lawgiver giving a lively representation of the whole from one <lb/>
            part, starting from a universal example, and discussing, poten­ <lb/>
            tially at least, the other points as to which he was silent.</p>
          <p>L. The filling of the belly is a most enduring and universal <lb/>
            thing; and, as it were, a kind of foundation of the other <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiv. 28. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus ix. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus i. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> § Leviticus L 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="146"/>
            passions. At all events, there is not one of them which can <lb/>
            find any existence if it is not supported by the belly, on which <lb/>
            nature has made everything to depend. On this account, when <lb/>
            the goods of the soul had previously been born of Leah, and <lb/>
            had ended in Judah,* that is to say, in confession, God being <lb/>
            about to create also the improvements of the body, prepared <lb/>
            Bilhah, the hand-maid of Rachel, to bear children on behalf <lb/>
            of and before her mistress. And the name Bilhah, being inter­ <lb/>
            preted, means deglutition. For he knew that not one of the <lb/>
            corporeal faculties can exist without imbibing moisture and <lb/>
            without the belly; but the belly is predominant over and the <lb/>
            ruler of the whole body, and the preserver of this corporeal <lb/>
            mass in a state of existence.</p>
          <p>And observe the subtle way in which all this is expressed; <lb/>
            for you will not find a single word used superfluously. Moses <lb/>
            indeed " takes away the breast," but as for the belly he does <lb/>
            not take that away, but he washes it.t Why so ? Because <lb/>
            the perfectly wise man is able to repudiate and to eradicate all <lb/>
            the angry passions, making them rise up and abandon anger ; but <lb/>
            he is unable to cut out and discard the belly, for nature is <lb/>
            compelled to use the necessary meats and drinks, even if a <lb/>
            man, being content with the scantiest possible supply of ne­ <lb/>
            cessaries should despise it, and purpose to himself to abjure <lb/>
            eating. Let him therefore wash and purify it from all super­ <lb/>
            fluous and unclean preparations; for to be able to do even this <lb/>
            is a very sufficient gift from God to the lover of virtue.</p>
          <p>LI. On this account Moses says, with respect to the soul <lb/>
            which is suspected of having committed adultery,‡ that, if <lb/>
            having abandoned right reason, which is man living according <lb/>
            to the law, it shall be found to have gone over to passion, <lb/>
            which pollutes the soul, " it shall become swollen in the <lb/>
            belly," which means it shall have all the pleasures and appe­ <lb/>
            tites of the belly unsatisfied and insatiable, and it shall never <lb/>
            cease to be greedy through ignorance, but pleasures in bound­ <lb/>
            less number shall flow into it, and thus its passions shall be <lb/>
            interminable. Now I know many people who have fallen into <lb/>
            error in respect of the appetites of the belly, that while still <lb/>
            devoting themselves to their gratifications, they have again <lb/>
            rushed with eagerness to wine and other luxuries; for the ap. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 35. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers v. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Leviticus viii. 29—ix. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="147"/>
            petites of the intemperate soul bear no analogy to the mass of <lb/>
            the body. But some men, like vessels made to hold a certain <lb/>
            measure, desire nothing extravagant, but discard everything <lb/>
            that is superfluous; but appetite on the other hand is never <lb/>
            satisfied, but remains always in want and thirsty. In refer­ <lb/>
            ence to which the expression, that " the thigh shall fall away," <lb/>
            is added in immediate connexion with the denunciation that <lb/>
            " her belly shall swell;" for then right reason, which has the <lb/>
            seeds and originating principles of good, falls from the soul.</p>
          <p>" If therefore," says Moses, " she has not been corrupted, <lb/>
            then she shall be pure; and free from all infliction from ge­ <lb/>
            neration to generation;" that is to say, if she has not been <lb/>
            polluted by passion, but has kept herself pure in respect of <lb/>
            her legitimate husband, sound reason, her proper guide, she <lb/>
            shall have a productive and fertile soul, bearing the offspring <lb/>
            of prudence and justice and all virtue.</p>
          <p>LII. Is it then possible for us, who are bound up in our <lb/>
            bodies, to avoid complying with the necessities of the body ? <lb/>
            And if it is possible, how is it possible ? But consider, the <lb/>
            priest recommends him who is led away by his bodily neces­ <lb/>
            sities to indulge in nothing beyond what is strictly necessary. <lb/>
            In the first place, says he, " Let there be a place for thee <lb/>
            outside of'the camp meaning by the camp virtue, in which <lb/>
            the soul is encamped and fortified; for prudence and a free <lb/>
            indulgence in the necessities of the body cannot abide in the <lb/>
            same place. After that he says, " And you shall go out <lb/>
            there." Why so ? Because the soul, which is abiding in coin­ <lb/>
            panionship with prudence and dwelling in the house of wis­ <lb/>
            dom, cannot indulge in any of the delights of the body, for it <lb/>
            is at that time nourished on a diviner food in the sciences, in <lb/>
            consequence of which it neglects the flesh, for when it has <lb/>
            gone forth beyond the sacred thresholds of virtue, then it <lb/>
            turns to the material substances, which disarrange and op­ <lb/>
            press the soul. How then am I to deal with them? "It <lb/>
            shall be a peg," says Moses, " upon thy girdle, and thou shalt <lb/>
            dig with it that is to say, reason shall be close to you in <lb/>
            the case of the passion, which digs out and equips and clothes <lb/>
            it properly; for he desires that we should be girded up in <lb/>
            respect of the passions, and not to have them about us in a <lb/>
            loose and dissolute state. On which account, at the time of <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxiii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> L 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="148"/>
            the passage through them, which is called the passover, he <lb/>
            enjoins us all " to have our loins girded,"* that is to say, to <lb/>
            have our appetites under restraint. Let the peg, therefore, <lb/>
            that is to say reason, follow the passion, preventing it from <lb/>
            becoming dissolute; for in this way we shall be able to con­ <lb/>
            tent ourselves with only so much as is necessary, and to <lb/>
            abstain from what is superfluous.</p>
          <p>LIII. And in this way when we are at entertainments, and <lb/>
            when we are about to come to the enjoyment and use of <lb/>
            luxuries that have been prepared for us, let us approach them <lb/>
            taking reason with us as a defensive armour, and let us not fill <lb/>
            ourselves with food beyond all moderation like cormorants, nor <lb/>
            let us satiate ourselves with immoderate draughts of strong <lb/>
            wine, and so give way to intoxication which compels men to act <lb/>
            like fools. For reason will bridle and curb the violence and <lb/>
            impetuosity of such a passion. I myself, at all events, know <lb/>
            that it has done so with regard to many of the passions, for <lb/>
            when I have gone to entertainments where no respect was <lb/>
            paid to discipline, and to sumptuous banquets, whenever I <lb/>
            went without taking Reason with me as a guide, I became a <lb/>
            slave to the luxuries that lay before me, being under the guid­ <lb/>
            ance of masters who could not be tamed, with sights and <lb/>
            sounds of temptation, and all other such things also as work <lb/>
            pleasure in a man by the agency of his senses of smell and <lb/>
            taste. But when I approach such scenes in the company of <lb/>
            reason, I then become a master instead of a slave: and with­ <lb/>
            out being subdued myself win a glorious victory of self-denial and <lb/>
            temperance; opposing and contending against all the appetites <lb/>
            which subdue the intemperate. " Thou shalt be armed," <lb/>
            Moses therefore says, "with the peg."† That is to say, you, <lb/>
            by the aid of reason, shall lay bare the nature which each of <lb/>
            the separate passions has, eating, and drinking, and indulging <lb/>
            in the pleasures of the belly, and you shall distinguish <lb/>
            between them, that when you have so distinguished you may <lb/>
            know the truth. For then you shall know that there is no <lb/>
            good in any of these things, but only what is necessary and <lb/>
            useful. " And bringing it over, you shall cover what is inde­ <lb/>
            corous,"‡ speaking very appropriately. For come to me, 0 my <lb/>
            soul, bring reason to everything by which all unseemliness of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxiii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="149"/>
            flesh and of passion is concealed, and overshadowed and <lb/>
            hidden. For all the things which are not in combination with <lb/>
            reason are [disgraceful, just as those which are done in union <lb/>
            with reason are seemly. Therefore the man who is devoted to <lb/>
            pleasure goes on his belly, but the perfect man washes his <lb/>
            whole belly, and he who is only advancing towards perfection <lb/>
            washes the things in his belly. But he who is now beginning <lb/>
            to be instructed proceeds out of doors when he is intent upon <lb/>
            curbing the passions of the belly by bringing reason to work <lb/>
            upon the necessities of the belly, and reason is called symboli­ <lb/>
            cally a peg.</p>
          <p>LIV. Moses therefore does well when he adds, " Thou shalt <lb/>
            go upon thy breast and upon thy belly."* For pleasure is not <lb/>
            one of the things which is tranquil and steady, but is rather a <lb/>
            thing which is in constant motion and full of confusion, for <lb/>
            as flame is excited by being moved, so passion when it is put <lb/>
            in motion in the soul, being in some respects like a flame, <lb/>
            does not suffer it to rest. On which account he does not <lb/>
            agree with those who pronounce pleasure a stable feeling, for <lb/>
            tranquillity is connected with stones and trees, and all kinds of <lb/>
            inanimate things, but is quite inconsistent with pleasure; <lb/>
            for it is fond of tickling and convulsive agitation, and with <lb/>
            regard to some of its indulgences it has not need of tranquillity <lb/>
            but of an intense and violent unseemliness of commotion.</p>
          <p>LV. But the expression, " And dust shalt thou eat'all the <lb/>
            days of thy life," is also used with great propriety. For the <lb/>
            pleasures which are derived from the food of the body are all <lb/>
            earthly. And may we not reasonably speak thus? There <lb/>
            are two several parts of which we consist, the soul and the <lb/>
            body; now the body is made of earth, but the soul consists <lb/>
            of air, being a fragment of the Divinity, for " God breathed <lb/>
            into man's face the breath of life, and man became a living <lb/>
            soul."† It is therefore quite consistent with reason to say that <lb/>
            the body which was fashioned out of the earth has nourish. <lb/>
            ment which the earth gives forth akin to the matter of which <lb/>
            it is composed; but the soul, inasmuch as it is a portion of the <lb/>
            ethereal nature, is supported by nourishment which is ethereal <lb/>
            and divine, for it it is nourished on knowledge, and not on <lb/>
            meat or drink, which the body requires.</p>
          <p>LVI. But that the food of the soul is not earthly but hea­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="150"/>
            venly the Holy Scriptures will testify in many passages, <lb/>
            " Behold I will rain upon you bread from heaven, and the <lb/>
            people shall come forth, and shall collect from day to day, <lb/>
            when I will try them, whether they will walk according to <lb/>
            ray law or not."* You see that the soul is nourished not on <lb/>
            earthly and corruptible food, but on the reasons which God <lb/>
            rains down out of his sublime and pure nature, which he calls <lb/>
            heaven. "Let the people indeed go forth and the whole <lb/>
            system of the soul likewise, and let it collect science and begin <lb/>
            knowledge, not in large quantities but from day to day." <lb/>
            For, in the first place, in that way it will not exhaust all at <lb/>
            once the abundant riches of the grace of God: but it will over­ <lb/>
            flow like a torrent with their superfluity. Secondly, it will <lb/>
            happen that when they have taken such good things as are <lb/>
            sufficient for them and duly measured, they will think God <lb/>
            the dispenser of the rest. But he who endeavours to collect <lb/>
            everything at once is only acquiring for himself despair with <lb/>
            great sorrow,! for he becomes full of despair if he expects <lb/>
            that God will only rain good things upon him at the present <lb/>
            moment, and that he will not do so hereafter. And he <lb/>
            becomes inclined to infidelity if he does not believe that the <lb/>
            graces of God will be both at present and in all time abund­ <lb/>
            antly poured upon those who are worthy of them. And he is <lb/>
            foolish, moreover, if he thinks that he shall be a competent <lb/>
            • guardian of what he has collected contrary to God's will. For <lb/>
            a very slight inclination is sufficient to make the mind, which <lb/>
            in its boastfulness attributes safety and stability to itself, an <lb/>
            impotent and unsure keeper of those things of which it fancied <lb/>
            itself a safe guardian.</p>
          <p>LVII. Collect therefore, 0 my soul, what is sufficient and <lb/>
            proper, and in such a quantity as shall neither exceed by being <lb/>
            more than is sufficient, nor fall short by being less than what is <lb/>
            requisite: that so, using just measures you may not be led <lb/>
            into the commission of injustice.</p>
          <p>For while meditating on the migration from the passions <lb/>
            and sacrificing the passover you ought to take the advance <lb/>
            towards perfection, that is to say the sheep, in a moderate spirit. <lb/>
            " For each person of you," says Moses, " shall take a sheep, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvi. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t It seems that for <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνίας</foreign>, sorrow, we ought rather to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀπιστίας</foreign>, <lb/>
            infidelity, as it is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄπιστος</foreign> which is afterwards joined with <foreign xml:lang="grc">δύσελπς</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="151"/>
            such as shall be sufficient for him according to the number of <lb/>
            his house. '*</p>
          <p>And in the case of the manna therefore, and of every gift <lb/>
            which God gives to the race of mankind, the principle being <lb/>
            guided by numbering and by measure, and of not taking what <lb/>
            is more than is necessary for us, is good ; for the opposite <lb/>
            conduct is covetousness. Let therefore one soul collect what <lb/>
            is sufficient for it from day to day,* that it may show that it <lb/>
            is not itself which is the guardian of good things, but the <lb/>
            bounteous giver, God.</p>
          <p>LVIII. And this appears to me to be the reason why the <lb/>
            sentence which I have ci ted above was uttered. Day is an <lb/>
            emblem of light, and the light of the soul is instruction. <lb/>
            Many persons therefore have provided for themselves the lights <lb/>
            that can exist in the soul against night and darkness, but not <lb/>
            against day-time and light; such lights for instance, as are <lb/>
            derived from rudimental instruction, and those branches of <lb/>
            education which are called encyclical, and philosophy itself, <lb/>
            which is sought after for the sake both of the pleasure which <lb/>
            is derived from it, and also of the influence which it gives <lb/>
            among rulers. But the good man seeks the day for the sake <lb/>
            of the day, and the light for the light's sake; and he labours <lb/>
            to acquire what is good for the sake of the good itself, and <lb/>
            not of anything else, on which account Moses adds, "In <lb/>
            order that I may tempt them and see whether they will walk <lb/>
            according to my law or not," † for the divine law enjoins us <lb/>
            to honour virtue for its own sake. Accordingly, right reason <lb/>
            tests those who practise virtue as one might test a coin, to see <lb/>
            whether they have contracted any stain, referring the good <lb/>
            things of the soul to any of the external things; or whether <lb/>
            they decide upon it as good money, preserving it in the <lb/>
            intellect alone. These men are nourished not on earthly <lb/>
            things, but on heavenly knowledge.</p>
          <p>LIX. And Moses shows this in other passages also, when <lb/>
            he says, " And in the morning the dew lay round about the <lb/>
            hosts; and when the dew that lay in the morning was gone <lb/>
            up, behold! upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small <lb/>
            round thing, small as coriander seed,! and white like the hoar- <lb/>
            frost upon the earth. And when they saw it, they said one to <lb/>
            another, what is this ? for they knew not what it was, and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xii. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xvi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xi. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="152"/>
            Moses said to them, This is the bread which the Lord hath <lb/>
            given you to eat, this is the thing which the Lord hath com­ <lb/>
            manded you." *</p>
          <p>You see now what kind of thing the food of the Lord is, <lb/>
            it is the continued word of the Lord, like dew, surrounding <lb/>
            the whole soul in a circle, and allowing no portion of it to be <lb/>
            without its share of itself. And this word is not apparent in <lb/>
            every place, but wherever there is a vacant space, void of <lb/>
            passions and vice; and it is subtle both to understand and to <lb/>
            be understood, and it is exceedingly transparent and clear to <lb/>
            be distinguished, and it is like coriander seed. And agricul­ <lb/>
            turists say that the seed of the coriander is capable of being <lb/>
            cut up and divided into innumerable pieces, and if sown in each <lb/>
            separate piece and fragment, it shoots up just as much as the <lb/>
            whole seed could do. Such also is the word of God, being <lb/>
            profitable both in its entirety and also in every part, even if it <lb/>
            be ever so small.</p>
          <p>May it not be also likened to the pupil of the eye ? For as that, <lb/>
            being the smallest portion of the eye, does nevertheless behold <lb/>
            the entire orbs of existing things and the boundless sea, and <lb/>
            the vastness of the air, and the whole immeasurable space of <lb/>
            heaven, which the sun, whether rising in the east or setting in <lb/>
            the west, can bound; so also is the word of God, very sharp- <lb/>
            sighted, so as to be capable of beholding every thing, and by <lb/>
            which all things that are worth seeing can be beheld, in <lb/>
            reference to which fact it is white. For what can be more <lb/>
            brilliant or visible at a greater distance than the divine word, <lb/>
            by participation in which all other things can repel mists and <lb/>
            darkness, being eager to share in the light of the soul ?</p>
          <p>LX. There is a certain peculiarity which is attached to <lb/>
            this word. For when it calls the soul to itself, it excites a <lb/>
            congealing power in everything which is earthly, or corporeal, <lb/>
            or under the influence of the external senses. On which <lb/>
            account it is said to be " like the hoar-frost on the earth." t <lb/>
            For when the man who beholds God, meditates a flight from <lb/>
            the passions, "the waves are frozen," that is to say, the im­ <lb/>
            petuous rush, and the increase, and the haughty pride of the <lb/>
            waves are arrested, in order that he who might behold the <lb/>
            living God might then pass over the passion.J Therefore the <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvi. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus vi. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xvi, 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="153"/>
            souls inquire of one another, those, that is, that have clearly <lb/>
            felt the influence of the word, but which are not able to say <lb/>
            what it is. For very often, when sensible of a sweet taste, we <lb/>
            are nevertheless ignorant of the flavour which has caused it, <lb/>
            and when we smell sweet scents, we still do not know what <lb/>
            they are. And in the same manner also the soul very often, <lb/>
            when it is delighted, is yet unable to explain what it is that <lb/>
            has delighted it; but it is taught by the hierophant and <lb/>
            prophet Moses, who tells it, "This is the bread, the food which <lb/>
            God has given for the soul,"* explaining that God has brought <lb/>
            it, his own word and his own reason; for this bread which he <lb/>
            has given us to eat is this word of his.</p>
          <p>LXI. He says also in Deuteronomy, " And he has humbled <lb/>
            thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with manna, <lb/>
            which thou knowest not, neither did thy fathers know, that he <lb/>
            might make thee know that man shall not live by bread alone, <lb/>
            but by every word which proceedeth out of the mouth of the <lb/>
            Lord doth man live."t Now this ill-treating and humbling <lb/>
            of them is a sign of his being propitiated by them, for he is <lb/>
            propitiated as to the souls of us who are wicked on the tenth <lb/>
            day. For when he strips us of all our pleasant things, we <lb/>
            appear to ourselves to be ill-treated, that is in truth to have <lb/>
            God propitious to us.</p>
          <p>And God also causes us hunger, not that which proceeds <lb/>
            from virtue, but that which is engendered by passion and vice. <lb/>
            And the proof of this is, that he nourishes us with his own <lb/>
            word, which is the most universal of all things, for manna <lb/>
            being interpreted, means "what?" and "what" is the most <lb/>
            universal of all things; for the word of God is over all the <lb/>
            world, and is the most ancient, and the most universal of all <lb/>
            the things that are created. This word our fathers knew not; <lb/>
            I speak not of those who are so in truth, but of those who are <lb/>
            grey with age, who say, "Let us give them a guide, and let us <lb/>
            turn back" ‡ unto passion, that is to say, to Egypt. Therefore, <lb/>
            let God enjoin the soul, saying to it that, "Man shall not <lb/>
            live by bread alone," speaking in a figure, " but by every <lb/>
            word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God," that is to <lb/>
            say, he shall be nourished by the whole word of God, and <lb/>
            by every portion of it. For the mouth is the symbol of <lb/>
            the language, and a word is a portion of it. Accordingly the <note type="footnote"> " Exodus xvi. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy vii. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xiv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="154"/>
            soul of the more perfect man is nourished by the whole word ; <lb/>
            but we must be contented if we are nourished by a portion <lb/>
            of it.</p>
          <p>LXII. But these men pray to be nourished by the word ot <lb/>
            God: but Jacob, raising his head above the word, says that <lb/>
            he is nourished by God himself, and his words are as follows: <lb/>
            " The God in whom my father Abraham and Isaac were well­ <lb/>
            pleased ; the God who has nourished me from my youth <lb/>
            upwards to this day ; the angel who has delivered me from all <lb/>
            my evils, bless these children."* This now being a symbol <lb/>
            of a perfect disposition, thinks God himself his nourisher, and <lb/>
            not the word : and he speaks of the angel, which is the word, <lb/>
            as the physician of his evils, in this speaking most naturally. <lb/>
            For the good things which lie has previously mentioned are <lb/>
            pleasing to him, inasmuch as the living and true God has <lb/>
            given them to him face to face, but the secondary good things <lb/>
            have been given to him by the angels and by the word of God. <lb/>
            On this account I think it is that God gives men pure good <lb/>
            health, which is not preceded by any disease in the body, by <lb/>
            himself alone, but that health which is an escape from disease <lb/>
            he gives through the medium of skill and medical science, <lb/>
            attributing it to science, and to him who can apply it skilfully, <lb/>
            though in truth, it is God himself who heals both by these <lb/>
            means, and without these means. And the same is the case <lb/>
            with regard to the soul, the good things, namely food, he <lb/>
            gives to men by his power alone ; but those which contain in <lb/>
            them a deliverance from evil, he gives by means of his angels <lb/>
            and his word.</p>
          <p>LXIII. And he uttered this prayer, blaming Joseph the <lb/>
            statesman and governor, because he had ventured to say, " I <lb/>
            will feed them in that land,"t for, " hasten ye," said Joseph, <lb/>
            " and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus says Joseph," <lb/>
            and so on, and presently he adds, " Come down unto me, and <lb/>
            do not tarry, come with all thou hast, and I will feed thee in <lb/>
            that land; for still the famine lasts for five years." Jacob, <lb/>
            therefore, speaks as he does reproving and at the same time <lb/>
            instructing this imaginary wise man, and he says to him, " 0 <lb/>
            my friend, know thou that the food of the soul is knowledge, <lb/>
            which it is not the word which is intelligible by the external j <lb/>
            senses that can bestow, but God only who has nourished me <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlviii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xlv. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="155"/>
            from youth, and from my earliest age till the time of perfect <lb/>
            manhood, he shall fill me with it. Joseph therefore was <lb/>
            treated in the same way with his mother Rachel, for she <lb/>
            also thought that the creature had some power; on which <lb/>
            account she used the expression, " Give me children," but <lb/>
            the supplanter, adhering to his proper character, says to her, <lb/>
            " You have used a great error; for I am not in the peace of <lb/>
            God, who alone is able to open the womb of the soul,* and to <lb/>
            implant virtues in it, and to cause it to be pregnant, and to <lb/>
            bring forth what is good. Consider also the history of thy sis­ <lb/>
            ter Leah, and you will find that she did not receive seed or <lb/>
            fertility from any creature-but from God himself."</p>
          <p>" For the Lord, seeing that Leah was hated, opened her <lb/>
            womb, but Rachel was barren."t And consider, now, in this <lb/>
            sentence, again, the subtlety of the writer spoken of. God <lb/>
            opens the wombs, implanting good actions in them, and the <lb/>
            womb, when it has received virtue from God, does not bring <lb/>
            forth to God, for the living and true God is not in need of any <lb/>
            thing, but she brings forth sons to me, Jacob, for it was for <lb/>
            my sake, probably, that God sowed seed in virtue, and not <lb/>
            for his own. Therefore, another husband of Leah is found to <lb/>
            be passed over in silence, and another father of Leah's children, <lb/>
            for he is the husband who openeth the womb, and he is the <lb/>
            father of the children to whom the mother is said to bear <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>LXIV. "And I will place enmity between thee and between <lb/>
            the woman."‡ In reality, pleasure is hostile to the external <lb/>
            sense, although, to some persons, it appears to be especially <lb/>
            friendly to it. But as one would not call a flatterer a corn <lb/>
            panion (for flattery is a disease of friendship), nor would one <lb/>
            call a courtezan friendly to her lover, for she adheres only to <lb/>
            those who give her presents, and not to those who love her; so, <lb/>
            also, if you investigate the nature of pleasure, you will find <lb/>
            that she has but a spurious connection with the external senses. <lb/>
            When we are sated with pleasure, then we find that the organs <lb/>
            of the external senses in us lose their tone. Or do not you <lb/>
            perceive the state of those men who from love of wine get <lb/>
            drunk ?-that seeing they do not see, and hearing they do <lb/>
            not hear; and, in the same way, they are deprived of the accu­ <lb/>
            rate energies of the other external senses ? And, at times, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Genesis xxix. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="156"/>
            through immoderate indulgence in food, all the vigour of the <lb/>
            external senses is relaxed when sleep overtakes them, which <lb/>
            has derived its name from the relaxation of them. For, at <lb/>
            that time, the organs of the external senses are relaxed, just <lb/>
            as they are on the stretch in our waking hours, when they no <lb/>
            longer receive unintelligible blows from external things, but <lb/>
            such as speak loudly and are evident, and which transmit their <lb/>
            impressions to the mind. For the mind, when stricken, must <lb/>
            recognize the external thing, and receive a visible impression <lb/>
            from it.</p>
          <p>LXV. And take notice here, that Moses does not say, <lb/>
            " I will cause enmity to thee and the woman," but, " I will <lb/>
            place enmity between thee and between the woman:"—why so? <lb/>
            because the war between these two is concerning what is in the <lb/>
            middle, and what lies, as it were, on the borders of pleasure <lb/>
            and of the outward sense. And that which lies between them <lb/>
            is what is drinkable, and what is eatable, and what is inclined <lb/>
            to all such things, every one of which is an object to be <lb/>
            appreciated by the outward sense, and an efficient cause of <lb/>
            pleasure. When, therefore, pleasure wallows immoderately in <lb/>
            these things, it at once by so doing inflicts injury on the <lb/>
            outward sense. And again, the expression, " between thy seed <lb/>
            and between her seed," is uttered with strict natural propriety, <lb/>
            for all seed is the beginning of generation. But the beginning <lb/>
            of pleasure is not passion, but an emotional impulse of the <lb/>
            outward sense, set in motion by the mind. For from this, <lb/>
            as from a fountain, the faculties of the outward senses are <lb/>
            derived, especially, according to the most sacred Moses, who <lb/>
            says that the woman was formed out of Adam, that is to say, <lb/>
            the outward sense was formed out of the mind. The part, <lb/>
            therefore, that pleasure acts towards the outward sense, <lb/>
            passion also acts towards the mind. So that, since the two <lb/>
            former are at enmity with one another, the two latter must <lb/>
            likewise be in a state of hostility.</p>
          <p>LXVI. And the war between these things is manifest. <lb/>
            At all events, according to the superiority of the mind when <lb/>
            it applies itself to incorporeal objects, which are perceptible <lb/>
            only to the intellect, passion is put to flight. And, on the <lb/>
            other hand, when this latter gains a shameful victory, the <note type="footnote"> * Philo here supposed that <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὔπνος</foreign>, sleep, is derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄφεσις</foreign>, <lb/>
            relaxation, or from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὑφίημι</foreign>, to relax. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="157"/>
            mind yields, being hindered from giving its attention to itself <lb/>
            and to all its actions. At all events, he says in another place, <lb/>
            " When Moses lifted up his hands Israel prevailed, and when <lb/>
            he let them down Amalek prevailed."* And this statement <lb/>
            implies, that when the mind raises itself up from mortal affairs <lb/>
            and is elevated on high, it is very vigorous because it beholds <lb/>
            God ; and the mind here means Israel. But when it relaxes <lb/>
            its vigour and becomes powerless, then immediately the <lb/>
            passions will prevail, that is to say, Amalek; which name, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means, the people licking. For lie does, <lb/>
            of a verity, devour the whole soul, and licks it up, leaving <lb/>
            no seed behind, nor anything which can excite'virtue; in <lb/>
            reference to which it is said, " Amalek is the beginning of <lb/>
            nations; "t because passion governs, and is the absolute lord <lb/>
            of nations, all mingled and confused and jumbled in disorder, <lb/>
            without any settled plan; and, through passion, all the war <lb/>
            of the soul is fanned and kept alive. For God makes a <lb/>
            promise to the same minds to which he grants peace, that he <lb/>
            will efface the memorial of Amalek from all the lands beneath <lb/>
            the heaven.</p>
          <p>LXVII. And the expression, "He shall watch thy head, and <lb/>
            thou shalt watch his heel,"‡ is, as to its language, a barbarism, <lb/>
            but, as to the meaning which is conveyed by it, a correct <lb/>
            expression. Why so ? It ought to be expressed with respect <lb/>
            to the woman : but the woman is not he, but she. What, <lb/>
            then, are we to say ? From his discourse about the woman <lb/>
            he has digressed to her seed and her beginning. Now the <lb/>
            beginning of the outward sense is the mind. But the mind <lb/>
            is masculine, in respect of which one may say, he, his, and <lb/>
            so on. Very correctly, therefore, does God here say to pleasure, <lb/>
            that the mind shall watch your principal and predominant <lb/>
            doctrine, and you shall watch the traces of the mind itself, <lb/>
            and the foundations of the things which are pleasing to it, <lb/>
            to which the heel has very naturally been likened,</p>
          <p>LXVIII. But the words, " shall watch," intimate two <lb/>
            things : in the first place it means as it were "shall keep," <lb/>
            and " shall preserve." And, in the second place, it is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to " shall watch for the purpose of destroying." Now <lb/>
            it is inevitable that the mind must be either bad or good. <lb/>
            Now, if it be bad, it would be but a foolish guardian and dis­ <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xvii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxiv. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="158"/>
            penser of pleasure, for it rejoices in it. But the good mail <lb/>
            is an enemy to it, expecting that, when he once attacks it, he <lb/>
            will be able utterly to destroy it. And, indeed, on the other <lb/>
            hand, pleasure watches the footsteps of the foolish man, but <lb/>
            endeavours to trip up and undermine the standing ground of <lb/>
            the wise man, thinking that he is always meditating its <lb/>
            destruction ; but that the fool is always considering the means <lb/>
            by which its safety may be best secured. But, nevertheless, <lb/>
            though pleasure appears to trip up and to deceive the good <lb/>
            man, it will in reality be tripped up itself by that experienced <lb/>
            wrestler, Jacob ; and that, too, not in the wrestling of the <lb/>
            body, but in that struggle which the soul carries on against <lb/>
            the dispositions which are antagonistic to it, and which attack <lb/>
            it through the agency of the passions and vices; and it will <lb/>
            not let go the heel of its antagonist, passion, before it surren­ <lb/>
            ders, and confesses that it has been twice tripped up and <lb/>
            defeated, both in the matter of the birthright, and also in that <lb/>
            of the blessing. For " rightly," says Esau, " is his name <lb/>
            called Jacob, for now has he supplanted me for the second <lb/>
            time ; the first time he took away my birthright, and now he <lb/>
            has taken away my blegsing."*</p>
          <p>But the bad man thinks the things of the body the more <lb/>
            important, while the good man assigns the preference to the <lb/>
            things of the soul, which are in truth and reality the more <lb/>
            important and the first, not, indeed, in point of time, but in <lb/>
            power and. dignity, as is a ruler in a city. But the mistress <lb/>
            of the concrete being is the soul.</p>
          <p>LXIX. Therefore the one who was superior in virtue <lb/>
            received the first place, which, indeed, fell to him as his due. <lb/>
            For he also obtained the blessing in connection with the per­ <lb/>
            fection of prayer. But he is a vain and conceited pretender <lb/>
            to wisdom who said, " He took away my blessing and also my <lb/>
            birthright." For what he took, 0 foolish man, was not yours, <lb/>
            but was rather the opposite to what was yours. For your <lb/>
            deeds are thought worthy of slavery, but his are thought worthy <lb/>
            of supremacy. And if you are content to become the slave of <lb/>
            the wise man, you shall receive your share of reproof and of <lb/>
            correction, and so you shall discard ignorance and folly which <lb/>
            are the destruction of the soul. For thy father, when praying, <lb/>
            says to you, " You shall serve your brother,"t but not now; for <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 40. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="159"/>
            he will not be able to endure your endeavouring to throw off <lb/>
            the yoke. But when you have loosed his yoke from off your <lb/>
            neck, that is to say, when you have cast off the boastfulness <lb/>
            and arrogance which you had, after you had yoked yourself to <lb/>
            the chariot of the passions, under the guidance of the cha­ <lb/>
            rioteer, Folly. Now, indeed, you are the slave of cruel and <lb/>
            intolerable masters, who are within yourself, and who look <lb/>
            upon it as a law never to set any one free; but if you run <lb/>
            away and escape from them, then the master who loves slaves <lb/>
            will receive you in a good hope of freedom, and will not sur­ <lb/>
            render you any more to your former companions, having learnt <lb/>
            from Moses that necessary doctrine and lesson, " Not to give <lb/>
            up a servant to his master who has escaped from his master <lb/>
            unto him; for he shall dwell with him in any place which <lb/>
            shall please him."*</p>
          <p>LXX. But as long as you did not escape, and while you <lb/>
            were still bridled with the bridle of those masters, you were <lb/>
            unworthy to be the servant of a worse master. Giving thus <lb/>
            the greatest proof of a mean, and lowly, and servile disposition, <lb/>
            when you said, " My birthright and my blessing."t For these <lb/>
            are the words of men who have fallen into immode­ <lb/>
            rate ignorance, since it belongs to God alone to say, " Mine <lb/>
            for to him alone do all things properly belong. And to this <lb/>
            he will himself bear witness when he says, "My gifts, my <lb/>
            offerings, my first fruits." t</p>
          <p>You must take notice here that gifts are spoken of in contra­ <lb/>
            distinction to offerings. For the former display the manifesta­ <lb/>
            tion of the vastness of the perfect good things which God gives <lb/>
            to those men who are perfect, but the latter are only prepared <lb/>
            to last a very short time, and are partaken of by well-disposed <lb/>
            practisers of virtue who are making progress towards perfec­ <lb/>
            tion. On which account Abraham also, when following the <lb/>
            will of God, retained those things which had been given to him <lb/>
            by God : " but sends back the horses of the king of Sodom "§ <lb/>
            as the wages of harlots. And Moses also condescends to <lb/>
            administer justice in most important points, and with <lb/>
            reference to things of the greatest value. But the more <lb/>
            unimportant causes and trials he commits to judges of inferior <lb/>
            rank to investigate. And whoever ventures to assert that any <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxiii. 16. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xxviii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 36. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xiv. 21. </note> <lb/>

            thing is his own shall be set down as a slave for ever and <lb/>
            ever; as he who says, " I have loved my master, and my wife, <lb/>
            and my children; I will not depart and be free."* He does <lb/>
            well in confessing that slavery is proper for him; for can he <lb/>
            be any thing but a slave who says, " Mine is mind, which is <lb/>
            the master, being its own master, and possessed of absolute <lb/>
            power; mine, also are the outward senses, the sufficient <lb/>
            judges of corporeal substances ; mine, also are the offspring of <lb/>
            these objects of intellect which are the offspring of the mind, <lb/>
            and the objects of the outward senses, which are the offspring <lb/>
            of those same outward senses ; for it is in my power to exert <lb/>
            both the mind and the outward senses ?" But it is not sufficient <lb/>
            for such a man only to bear witness against himself, but, being <lb/>
            also condemned by God, who sentences him to most durable <lb/>
            and everlasting slavery, he shall undergo his sentence : and be <lb/>
            bored in the ear, that he may not receive the language of <lb/>
            virtue, but that he may be a slave for ever, both in his mind <lb/>
            and in his outward senses, which are bad and pitiless masters.</p>
          <p>LXXI. " And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply <lb/>
            thy sorrow and thy groaning, "† The affection which is called <lb/>
            pain is a suffering peculiar to woman, who is a symbol of the <lb/>
            outward sense. For to suffer pain belongs to the same subject <lb/>
            to which to experience pleasure does also belong. But we <lb/>
            experience pleasure through the medium of our outward <lb/>
            senses, as of necessity we also suffer pain through the same <lb/>
            medium. But the virtuous and purified mind suffers pain in <lb/>
            the least degree; for the outward senses have the least <lb/>
            degree of power over him. But passion is exceedingly power­ <lb/>
            ful in the case of the foolish man, inasmuch as he has no anti­ <lb/>
            dote in his soul by which he can ward off the evils which <lb/>
            proceed from the outward senses and from those objects which <lb/>
            can only be perceived by them. For as an athlete and a slave <lb/>
            are beaten in two different manners, the one in an abject man­ <lb/>
            ner, giving himself up to the ill-treatment, and yielding to it <lb/>
            submissively; but the athlete opposing, and resisting, and par­ <lb/>
            rying the blows which are aimed at him. And as you shave a <lb/>
            man in one way, and a pillow in another; for the one is seen <lb/>
            only in its suffering the shaving, but the man does himself do <lb/>
            something likewise, and as one may say, aids the infliction, <lb/>
            placing himself in a posture to be shaved; so the irrational <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="161"/>
            man, like a slave, submits himself to another, and surrenders <lb/>
            himself to the endurance of pains as to intolerable mistresses, <lb/>
            being unable to look them in the face, and wholly incapable of <lb/>
            conceiving any masculine or free thoughts. On which account <lb/>
            a countless number of painful things are endured by him <lb/>
            through the medium of the outward senses. But the man <lb/>
            of experience, valiantly resisting like a brave athlete with <lb/>
            strength and vigour, opposes himself resolutely to all painful <lb/>
            things, so as not to be wounded by them; but so as to keep <lb/>
            all their blows at a distance. And it seems to me that he <lb/>
            might with great spirit utter the verses of the tragedian <lb/>
            against pain in this manner :— <lb/>
            " Now scorch and burn my flesh, and fill yourself <lb/>
            With ample draughts of my life's purpled blood; <lb/>
            For sooner shall the stars' bright orbs descend <lb/>
            Beneath the darkened earth, the earth uprise <lb/>
            Above the sky, and all things be confounded, <lb/>
            Than you shall wrench one flattering word from me." *</p>
          <p>LXXII. But as God has allotted all painful things to the <lb/>
            outward sense in great abundance and intensity, so also has he <lb/>
            bestowed on the virtuous soul a boundless store of good things. <lb/>
            Accordingly he speaks with reference to the perfect man <lb/>
            Abraham in the following manner: " By myself have I sworn, <lb/>
            saith the Lord, that because thou hast done this thing and <lb/>
            hast not withheld thy son, thy beloved son from me, that in <lb/>
            blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply <lb/>
            thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is on <lb/>
            the shore of the sea."† He says this, and having confirmed <lb/>
            his promise solemnly and by an oath, and by an oath, too, such <lb/>
            as could alone become God. For you see that God does not <lb/>
            swear by any other being than himself, for there is nothing <lb/>
            more powerful than he is; but he swears by himself, because <lb/>
            he is the greatest of all things.</p>
          <p>But some men have said that it is inconsistent with <lb/>
            the character of God to swear at all; for that an oath is <lb/>
            received for the sake of the confirmation which it supplies; <lb/>
            but God is the only faithful being, and if any one else who is <lb/>
            dear to God; as Moses is said to have been faithful in all his <note type="footnote"> * This is a fragment of the Syleus of Euripides. The lines are put <lb/>
            in the mouth of Hercules. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> M </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="162"/>
            house.* And besides, the mere words of God are the most <lb/>
            sacred and holy of oaths, and laws, and institutions. And it <lb/>
            is a proof of his exceeding power, that whatever he says is sure <lb/>
            to take place ; and this is the most especial characteristic of an <lb/>
            oath. So that it would be quite natural to say that all the <lb/>
            words of God are oaths confirmed by the accomplishment of <lb/>
            the acts to which they relate. †</p>
          <p>LXXIII. They say, indeed, that an oath is a testimony <lb/>
            borne by God concerning a matter which is the subject of <lb/>
            doubt. But if God swears he is bearing testimony to himself, <lb/>
            which is an absurdity. For the person who bears the testi­ <lb/>
            mony, and he on whose behalf it is borne, ought to be two <lb/>
            different persons. What, then, are we to say? In the first <lb/>
            place, that it is not a matter of blame for God to bear testi­ <lb/>
            mony to himself. For what other being could be competent <lb/>
            to bear testimony to him ? In the second place, He himself <lb/>
            is to himself every thing that is most honourable-relative, <lb/>
            kinsman, friend, virtue, prosperity, happiness, knowledge, <lb/>
            understanding, beginning, end, entirety, universality, judge, <lb/>
            opinion, intention, law, action, supremacy.</p>
          <p>Besides, if we only receive the, expression, " By myself have <lb/>
            I sworn," in the manner in which we ought, we shall be in no <lb/>
            danger from sophistry. May we not, then, say, that the truth <lb/>
            is something of this sort? None of those beings which are <lb/>
            capable of entertaining belief, can entertain a firm belief <lb/>
            respecting God. For he has not displayed his nature to any <lb/>
            one; but keeps it invisible to every kind of creature. Who <lb/>
            can venture to affirm of him who is the cause of all things <lb/>
            either that he is a body, or that he is incorporeal, or that he <lb/>
            has such and such distinctive qualities, or that he has no such <lb/>
            qualities ? or who, in short, can venture to affirm any thing <lb/>
            positively about his essence, or his character, or his constitu­ <lb/>
            tion, or his movements ? But He alone can utter a positive <lb/>
            assertion respecting himself, since he alone has an accurate <lb/>
            knowledge of his own nature, without the possibility of mis­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xii. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> t There is a remarkable coincidence between Philo's argument here, <lb/>
            and that employed by St. Paul in reference to the same event. St. <lb/>
            Paul, Hebrews vi. 13, says, " For when God made promise to Abraham, <lb/>
            because he could swear by no greater, he swore by himself, saying, <lb/>
            ..... For man verily swears by the greater; and an oath for con­ <lb/>
            firmation is to them the end of strife." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="163"/>
            take. His positive assertion, therefore, is one which may be <lb/>
            thoroughly trusted in the first place, since he alone has any <lb/>
            knowledge respecting his actions ; so that he very appropriately <lb/>
            swore by himself, adding himself confirmation to his assertion, <lb/>
            which it was not possible for any one else to do. On which <lb/>
            account men who say that they swear by God may well be con­ <lb/>
            sidered impious. For no man can rightly swear by himself, <lb/>
            because he is not able to have any certain knowledge respect­ <lb/>
            ing his own nature, but we must be content if we are able to <lb/>
            understand even his name, that is to say, his word, which is <lb/>
            the interpreter of his will. For that must be God to us <lb/>
            imperfect beings, but the first mentioned, or true God, is so <lb/>
            only to wise and perfect men.</p>
          <p>And Moses, too, admiring the exceeding excellency of the <lb/>
            great uncreated God, says, " And thou shalt swear by his <lb/>
            name,"* not by himself. For it is sufficient for the creature <lb/>
            to receive confirmation and testimony from the word of God. <lb/>
            But God is his own confirmation and most unerring testimony.</p>
          <p>LXXIV. But the expression, " Because thou hast done this <lb/>
            thing,"† is a symbol of piety. For to do everything for the <lb/>
            sake of God alone is pious. In consequence of which we do <lb/>
            not spare even that beloved child of virtue, prosperity, sur <lb/>
            rendering it to the Creator, and thinking it right that our off­ <lb/>
            spring should become the possession of God, but not of any <lb/>
            created being. And that expression, also, is a good one, " In <lb/>
            blessing I will bless thee." For some persons do many acts <lb/>
            worthy of a blessing, but yet not in such a way as to obtain a <lb/>
            blessing. Since even a wicked man does some actions that <lb/>
            are proper, but he does not do them from being of a proper <lb/>
            disposition. And sometimes a drunken man or a mad man <lb/>
            speaks and acts in a sober manner, but still he is not speaking <lb/>
            or acting from a sober mind. And children, who are actually <lb/>
            infants, both do and say many things which reasonable men do <lb/>
            also do and say ; but they, of course, do it not in consequence <lb/>
            of any rational disposition, for nature has not yet endowed <lb/>
            them with a capacity of reasoning. But the law giver wishes <lb/>
            the wise man to appear deserving of blessing not occasionally, <lb/>
            accidentally, and, as it were, by chance, but in consequence of <lb/>
            habits and a disposition deserving of blessing.</p>
          <p>LXXV. Therefore it is not sufficient for the unfortunate <note type="footnote"> Deuteronomy vi. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> M 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="164"/>
            external sense to be abundantly occupied with pains, but it <lb/>
            must also be full of groaning. Now groaning is a violent and <lb/>
            intense pain. For we are very often in pain without groaning. <lb/>
            But, when we groan, we are under the influence of most <lb/>
            grievous and thickly pressing pain. Now, groaning is of a <lb/>
            twofold nature. One kind is that which arises in those who <lb/>
            desire and are very eager for august objects and who do not <lb/>
            succeed in them, which is wicked; the other kind is that <lb/>
            which proceeds from persons who repent and are distressed for <lb/>
            previous sins, and who say, "Miserable are we, how long a <lb/>
            time have we passed infected with the disease of foolishness, <lb/>
            and in the practices of all kinds of folly and iniquity." But <lb/>
            this kind of groaning does not exist unless the king of Egypt, <lb/>
            that is to say, the impious disposition wholly devoted to plea­ <lb/>
            sure, has perished and departed from our soul, " For, after <lb/>
            many days, the king of Egypt died."*</p>
          <p>Then immediately, as soon as vice is dead, the man who has <lb/>
            become alive to the perceptionof God and of his own sin, groans, <lb/>
            " For the children of Israel groaned at the corporeal and <lb/>
            Egyptian works;" since the reigning disposition devoted to <lb/>
            pleasure, while it is alive within us, persuades the soul to <lb/>
            rejoice at the sins which it commits; but, when that disposi­ <lb/>
            tion is dead, it groans over them ; on which account it cries out <lb/>
            to its master, beseeching him that it may not again be per <lb/>
            verted, and that it may not arrive at only an imperfect sort of <lb/>
            perfection. For many souls who have wished to turn to re­ <lb/>
            pentance have not been allowed to do so by God, but, been <lb/>
            dragged back, as it were by the ebbing tide, having returned <lb/>
            to their original courses; in the manner in which Lot's wife <lb/>
            did, who was turned into stone because she loved Sodom, and <lb/>
            who reverted to the disposition and habits which had been con­ <lb/>
            demned by God.</p>
          <p>LXXVI. But now Moses says that " Their cry has gone <lb/>
            up to God, bearing witness to the grace of the living God." <lb/>
            For if he had not powerfully summoned up to himself the <lb/>
            supplicatory language of that people it would not have gone <lb/>
            up; that is to say, it would never have gained power and <lb/>
            increase, would never have begun to soar so high, flying <lb/>
            from the lowness of earthly things. On which account, in the <lb/>
            next passage, God is represented as saying, " Behold the cry <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus mix. 26. </note> <lb/>

            of the children of Israel has come up to me."* Very beauti­ <lb/>
            fully here does Moses represent that their supplications have <lb/>
            reached God, but they would not have reached him if he who <lb/>
            was working him had not been a good man.</p>
          <p>But there are some souls which God even goes forward to <lb/>
            meet: " I will come to you and bless you." You see here how <lb/>
            great is the kindness of the Creator of all things, when he <lb/>
            even anticipates our delay and our intentions, and comes for­ <lb/>
            ward to meet us to the perfect benefiting of our souls. And <lb/>
            the expression used here is an oracle full of instruction. For, <lb/>
            if a thought of God enters the mind, it immediately blesses it <lb/>
            and heals all its diseases. But the outward sense is always <lb/>
            grieved and groans, and brings forth the perception of its <lb/>
            objects with pain and intolerable anguish. As also God him­ <lb/>
            self says, " In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children."</p>
          <p>Now, the sense of sight brings forth the operation of seeing, <lb/>
            the sense of hearing is the parent of the operation of hearing, <lb/>
            so is the sense of taste of tasting ; and, in short, each outward <lb/>
            sense is respectively the parent of its corresponding operation ; <lb/>
            but still it does not produce all these effects in the foolish man <lb/>
            without severe pain. For such a mail is affected by pain when <lb/>
            he sees, and when he hears, and when he tastes, and when he <lb/>
            smells, and, in fact, when he exerts any one of these outward <lb/>
            senses.</p>
          <p>LXXVII. On the other hand, you will find virtue not only <lb/>
            conceiving with extraordinary joy, but also bringing forth her <lb/>
            good offspring with laughter and cheerfulness; and you will <lb/>
            also find the offspring of the two parents to be actually cheer­ <lb/>
            fulness itself. Now that the wise man becomes a parent with <lb/>
            joy, and not with sorrow, the word of God itself will testify to <lb/>
            us when it speaks thus : " And God said unto Abraham, Sarai, <lb/>
            thy wife, shall no longer be called Sarai, but her name shall be <lb/>
            Sarah ; I will bless her, and give thee a son from her."† And, <lb/>
            afterwards, Moses proceeds to say, " And Abraham fell upon <lb/>
            his face and laughed, and said, " Shall a son be born to him <lb/>
            who is a hundred years old; and shall Sarah, who is ninety <lb/>
            years old, have a son?" Abraham, therefore, appears here to <lb/>
            be in a state of joy, and to be laughing because he is about to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xvii. 15. Sarah is interpreted Princess in the margin of <lb/>
            the bible. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="166"/>
            become the father of happiness, that is to say, of Isaac ; and <lb/>
            virtue, that is to say, Sarah, laughs also. And the same <lb/>
            prophet will further bear witness, speaking thus, " And it had <lb/>
            ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women, and she <lb/>
            laughed in her mind and said, such happiness has never yet <lb/>
            happened to me to this time, and my lord," that is to say, the <lb/>
            divine Lord, "is older than I;" in whose power, however, <lb/>
            this thing must inevitably be, and in whose power it is becom­ <lb/>
            ing to place confidence. For the offspring is laughter and joy. <lb/>
            For this is the meaning and interpretation of the name of <lb/>
            Isaac. Therefore, let the outward sense be grieved, but let <lb/>
            virtue be always rejoicing.</p>
          <p>For, also, when happiness, that is Isaac, was born, she says, <lb/>
            in the pious exaltation, " The Lord has caused me laughter, <lb/>
            and whoever shall hear of it shall rejoice with me."* Open <lb/>
            your ears, therefore, 0 ye initiated, and receive the most sacred <lb/>
            mysteries. Laughter is joy ; and the expression, " has caused," <lb/>
            is equivalent to " has begotten." So that what is here said has <lb/>
            some such meaning as this, " The Lord has begotten Isaac." <lb/>
            For he is the father of perfect nature, sowing and begetting <lb/>
            happiness in the soul.</p>
          <p>LXXVIII. " And thy desire," says God, " shall be to thy <lb/>
            husband."t There are two husbands of the outward senses. <lb/>
            The one a legal one, the other a destroyer. For the object of <lb/>
            sight, acting upon it like a husband, puts the sense of sight in <lb/>
            motion ; and so does sound affect the sense of hearing, flavour <lb/>
            the sense of taste, and so on with each of the outward senses <lb/>
            respectively. And these things attract the attention of and <lb/>
            call the irrational outward sense to itself, and become the <lb/>
            masters of it and govern it. For beauty enslaves the sight, <lb/>
            and sweet flowers enslave the sense of taste, and each of the <lb/>
            other objects of outward sense enslaves that sense which cor­ <lb/>
            responds to them. See the glutton, what a slave he is to all <lb/>
            the preparations which cooks and confectioners devise. Behold <lb/>
            the man who is devoted to the study of music, how he is <lb/>
            governed by the harp, or the flute, or by any one who is able <lb/>
            to sing. But the sense which turns itself to its legitimate <lb/>
            husband, that is to say, to the mind, derives the greatest <lb/>
            possible advantage from that object.</p>
          <p>LXXIX. Let us now see what account Moses gives of the I <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="167"/>
            mind itself, when it is set in motion in a way contrary to right <lb/>
            reason. And God said unto Adam, " Because thou hast <lb/>
            listened to the voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree of <lb/>
            which I commanded thee not to eat, because thou hast eaten <lb/>
            of it, cursed is the earth in thy actions."* It is a most mis­ <lb/>
            chievous thing, therefore, for the mind to be swayed by the <lb/>
            outward senses, but not for the outward senses to be guided by <lb/>
            the mind. For it is at all times proper that that which is <lb/>
            better should rule, and that that which is worse should be <lb/>
            ruled. And the mind is better than the outward senses. As, <lb/>
            therefore, when the charioteer has his horses under command <lb/>
            and guides the animals with the rein, the chariot is guided <lb/>
            wherever he pleases; but if they become restiff, and get the <lb/>
            better of the charioteer, he is often dragged out of his road, and <lb/>
            sometimes it even happens that the beasts themselves are <lb/>
            borne by the impetuosity of their course into a pit, and every­ <lb/>
            thing is carried away in a ruinous manner. And, as a ship <lb/>
            holds on her right course when the pilot has the helm in his <lb/>
            hand and steers her, and she is obedient to her rudder, but <lb/>
            the vessel is upset when some contrary wind descends upon the <lb/>
            waves and the whole sea is occupied by billows; so when the <lb/>
            mind, which is the charioteer or pilot of the soul, retains the <lb/>
            mastery over the entire animal, as a ruler does over a city, the <lb/>
            life of the man proceeds rightly. But when the outward sense, <lb/>
            which is devoid of reason, obtains the supremacy, then a <lb/>
            terrible confusion overtakes the man, as might happen if a <lb/>
            household of slaves were to conspire and to set upon their <lb/>
            master. For then, if one must tell the truth, the mind is set <lb/>
            fire to and burnt, the outward senses handling the flame and <lb/>
            placing the objects of their operation beneath, as fuel.</p>
          <p>LXXX. And Moses, indeed, speaks of and describes such a <lb/>
            conflagration of the mind as this which arises in consequence of <lb/>
            the operation of the outward senses, when he says, " And the <lb/>
            women still burnt additional fires in Moab." t For this expres­ <lb/>
            sion being interpreted means, from the father, because the mind <lb/>
            is our father." For then," says Moses, " the expounders of rid­ <lb/>
            dIes will say, Come to Heshbon, that the city of Sihon may be <lb/>
            built and furnished. Because fire has gone forth out of Hesh­ <lb/>
            bon, and a flame out of the city of Sihon, and has devoured as <lb/>
            far as Moab, and has consumed the high places of Arnon. Woe <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxi. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="168"/>
            unto thee, Moab, Chemosh is destroyed: their sons who had <lb/>
            sought to escape have been given up, and their daughters have <lb/>
            become captive to Sihon, king of the Amorites. And the seed <lb/>
            of them shall perish, from Heshbon even to Dibon. Moreover, <lb/>
            the women still burnt additional fire in Moab." Heshbon <lb/>
            being interpreted means reasonings ; and these must here <lb/>
            mean enigmas, full of indistinctness. Behold the reasoning <lb/>
            of the physician :—" I will purge the sick man, I will nourish <lb/>
            him, I will heal him with medicines and with diet, I will ex­ <lb/>
            tirpate his diseased parts, I will cauterise him." But very <lb/>
            often nature has healed the man without these remedies ; and <lb/>
            very often too has suffered him to die though they were <lb/>
            applied: so that the reasonings of the physician have been <lb/>
            utterly found out to be dreams, full of all indistinctness and <lb/>
            of riddles.</p>
          <p>Again, the husbandman says, I will scatter seed, I will <lb/>
            plant; the plants shall grow, they shall bear fruit, which shall <lb/>
            not only be useful for necessary enjoyment, but which shall <lb/>
            also be abundant for superfluity ; and then, on a sudden, fire, <lb/>
            or a storm, or continued rains, have destroyed everything. <lb/>
            But at times man has brought his labours to their due accomplish­ <lb/>
            ment, and yet he who formed all these plans has derived no <lb/>
            advantage from their being accomplished, but has died before <lb/>
            they were accomplished, and has in vain promised himself the <lb/>
            enjoyment of the fruits of his labours.</p>
          <p>LXXXI. It is best, therefore, to trust in God, and not in <lb/>
            uncertain reasonings, or unsure conjectures. " Abraham <lb/>
            trusted in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteous­ <lb/>
            ness."* And Moses governed the people, being testified to <lb/>
            that he was faithful with his whole house. But if we distrust <lb/>
            our own reason, we shall prepare and build ourselves a city <lb/>
            of the mind which will destroy the truth. For Sihon, being <lb/>
            interpreted means destroying. In reference to which he who <lb/>
            had dreamed, waking up, found that all the motions and all <lb/>
            the advances of the foolish man are merely dreams that have <lb/>
            no portion of truth in them, for the very mind is found to be <lb/>
            a dream ; and the only true doctrine is to believe in God, and <lb/>
            to trust to vain reasonings is a mere delusion. But irrational <lb/>
            impulse goes forth and proceeds to each extremity, while both <lb/>
            the reasonings and the mind corrupt the truth. On which <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="169"/>
            account, Moses says that " fire went out of Heshbon, and flame <lb/>
            out of the city of Sihon." So absurd is it to trust either to <lb/>
            plausible reasonings, or to the mind which corrupts the truth.</p>
          <p>LXXXII. " And it devours even as far as Moab that is <lb/>
            to say, as far as the mind. For what other creature, except the <lb/>
            miserable mind, can a false opinion deceive ? It devours and <lb/>
            consumes, and, in truth, it swallows up the pillars in it; that <lb/>
            is to say, all the particular notions which are engraved and <lb/>
            impressed upon it, as upon a pillar. But the pillars are Arnon, <lb/>
            which, being interpreted, means the light of Arnon, since <lb/>
            every one of these facts is made clear by reasoning. Accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, Moses begins presently to lament over the self-satisfied <lb/>
            and arrogant mind in this manner: "Woe unto thee, 0 city <lb/>
            of Moab!" For, if you give attention to the riddles which <lb/>
            arise out of the perception of what is probable, you have <lb/>
            destroyed the truth by so doing.</p>
          <p>"The people of Chemosh," that is to say, thy people and <lb/>
            thy power, have been found to be mutilated and blinded. For <lb/>
            Chemosh, being interpreted, means feeling with the hand. <lb/>
            And this action is the especial characteristic of one who does <lb/>
            not see. Now, their sons are particular reasonings—exiles; <lb/>
            and their opinions are in the place of daughters, being captives <lb/>
            to the king of the Amorites, that is to say, of those who con­ <lb/>
            verse with the sophist. For the name Amorites, being inter­ <lb/>
            preted, means talkers, being a symbol of the people who talk <lb/>
            much; and their guide and leader is the sophist, and he who is <lb/>
            skilful in reasoning and clever in investigating arts ; a man by <lb/>
            whom all those are deceived who once overpass the boundary <lb/>
            of truth.</p>
          <p>LXXXIII. Sihon, then, who destroys the sound rule of <lb/>
            truth, and his seed also, shall both perish; and so shall <lb/>
            Heshbon, namely, the sophistical riddles, as far as Debon; <lb/>
            which, being interpreted, means adjudication. And very con­ <lb/>
            sistently with nature shall this be. For what is probable and <lb/>
            plausible has not a positive knowledge respecting truth, but <lb/>
            only a trial and controversy and a litigious contest and strife, <lb/>
            and all such things as these. But it was not sufficient for the <lb/>
            mind to have its own peculiar evils, which were perceptible <lb/>
            only to the intellect; but still the women burnt additional <lb/>
            fire, that is to say, the outward senses excited a great con­ <lb/>
            flagration to have an effect upon it.</p><pb n="170"/>
            
          <p>See, now, what the meaning is of what is here said. We <lb/>
            who very often by night desist from energizing according to any <lb/>
            one of the outward senses, receive absurd impressions respect­ <lb/>
            in-, many different things, since our souls exist in a state of <lb/>
            perpetual motion and are capable of an infinite variety of <lb/>
            changes. There were, therefore, things quite sufficient for its <lb/>
            destruction which it brought forth out of itself. But now, as it <lb/>
            is, the multitude of the outward senses has brought against it <lb/>
            a most incalculable multitude of evils, partly from objects of <lb/>
            sight and partly from sounds; and besides that, from flavours <lb/>
            and from such essences as affect the sense of smell. And one <lb/>
            may almost say that the flavour which arises from them has a <lb/>
            more pernicious influence on the disposition of the soul than <lb/>
            that which is engendered in the soul itself, without any co- <lb/>
            operation or agency of the organs of sense.</p>
          <p>LXXXIV. One of these women is Pentephoe, the wife of <lb/>
            Pharaoh's chief cook.* We must now consider how a mail who <lb/>
            was a eunuch can be represented as having a wife. For there <lb/>
            will here be something which will seem to offer a reasonable <lb/>
            ground for perplexity to those who do not take the expressions <lb/>
            of the law in an allegorical sense. For the mind is really a <lb/>
            eunuch, and really the chief of cooks, using not merely such <lb/>
            pleasures as are simple, but those also which are superfluous, and <lb/>
            is therefore called a eunuch and barren of all wisdom, being <lb/>
            the eunuch and slave of no other master than of that squan­ <lb/>
            derer of all good things, Pharaoh. On another principle, <lb/>
            therefore, it might appear a most desirable thing to be a <lb/>
            eunuch, if our soul, by that means escaping vice, might be able <lb/>
            also to avoid all knowledge of passion. On which account <lb/>
            Joseph, that is to say, the disposition of continence, says to <lb/>
            Pleasure, who accosts him with, "Lie with me, and being a <lb/>
            man behave as a man, and enjoy the pleasant things which <lb/>
            life can afford." He, I say, refuses her, saying, " I shall be <lb/>
            sinning against God, who loves virtue, if I become a votary of <lb/>
            pleasure ; for this is a wicked action."</p>
          <p>LXXXV. And, at first, he only skirmishes, but presently <lb/>
            he fights and resists valiantly, when the soul enters into her <lb/>
            own dwelling, and, having recourse to her own strength and <lb/>
            energy, renounces the temptations of the body, and performs <lb/>
            her own appropriate actions as those which are the proper occu­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxix. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="171"/>
            pation of the soul; not appearing in the house of Joseph, nor <lb/>
            of Pentephoë, but in the house. Nor does Moses add a word <lb/>
            to describe whose house he means, in order to give you oppor­ <lb/>
            tunity to interpret allegorically, in an inquisitive spirit, the <lb/>
            meaning of the expression, "to do his business." The house, <lb/>
            therefore, is the soul, to which be runs, leaving all external <lb/>
            affairs, in order that what is spoken of may there be done.</p>
          <p>But may we not say that the conduct of the temperate man <lb/>
            is what it is, and is directed by the will of God ? For there <lb/>
            was not present any inconsistent idea of all those which are <lb/>
            accustomed to find their place within the soul. Moreover, <lb/>
            pleasure never ceases from struggling against the yoke, but, <lb/>
            seizing hold of his clothes, she cries, " Lie with me." Now, <lb/>
            clothes are, as it were, the covering of the body, just as life is <lb/>
            protected by meat and drink. And she says here, " Why do <lb/>
            you renounce pleasure, without which you cannot live ? <lb/>
            Behold, I take hold of the things which cause it; and I say <lb/>
            that you could not possibly exist unless you also made use of <lb/>
            some of the things which cause it."</p>
          <p>What, then, says the temperate man ? " Shall I," says he, <lb/>
            "become a slave to passion, on account of the material which <lb/>
            causes passion ? Nay, I will depart out of reach of the passion." <lb/>
            For, leaving his garment in her hand, he fled, and escaped out <lb/>
            of doors.</p>
          <p>LXXXVI. And who, some one perhaps, may say, ever <lb/>
            escapes in-doors ? Do not many do so ? Or have not some <lb/>
            people, avoiding the guilt of sacrilege, committed robberies in <lb/>
            private houses, or though not beating their own fathers, have <lb/>
            not they insulted the fathers of others ? Now these men do <lb/>
            escape from one class of offences, but they run into others. <lb/>
            But a man who is perfectly temperate, ought to avoid every <lb/>
            description of offence, whether greater or less, and never to be <lb/>
            detected in any sin whatever. But Joseph, for he is a young <lb/>
            man, and because as such he was unable to struggle with the <lb/>
            Egyptian body and to subdue pleasure, runs away. But <lb/>
            Phineas the priest, who was zealous with a great zeal for <lb/>
            God's service, did not provide for his own safety by flight; but <lb/>
            having taken to himself a yoke horse, that is to say, zeal com­ <lb/>
            bined with reason, would never desist till he had wounded the <lb/>
            Midianitish woman (that is to say the nature which was con­ <lb/>
             <pb n="172"/>
            cealed in the divine company), through her belly,- in order <lb/>
            that no plant or seed of wickedness might ever be able to shoot <lb/>
            out from it.</p>
          <p>LXXXVII. On which account after folly has been utterly <lb/>
            eradicated, the soul receives a two-fold prize, and a double <lb/>
            inheritance, peace and holiness, two kindred and sister-like <lb/>
            virtues. We must therefore refuse to listen to such a woman, <lb/>
            that is to say to a wicked temptation of the outward senses, <lb/>
            since " God gave a good reward to the midwiyes,"†because <lb/>
            they disregarded the commands of the wasteful Pharaoh, <lb/>
            " saving the male children of the soul alive," which he wished <lb/>
            to destroy, being a lover of the female offspring alone, and <lb/>
            rejecting all knowledge of the Cause of all things, and saying, <lb/>
            " I know him not."‡ But we must give our belief to another <lb/>
            woman, such as it was ordained that Sarah should be, Sarah <lb/>
            being in a figure the governing virtue ; and the wise Abraham <lb/>
            was guided by her, when she recommended him such actions <lb/>
            as were good. § For before this time, when he was not yet <lb/>
            perfect, but even before his name was changed, he gave his <lb/>
            attention to subjects of lofty philosophical speculation ; and <lb/>
            she, knowing that he could not produce anything out of perfect <lb/>
            virtue, counselled him to raise children out of her handmaid, <lb/>
            that is to say out of encyclical instruction, out of Agar,|| which <lb/>
            name being interpreted means a dwelling near; for he who <lb/>
            meditates dwelling in perfect virtue, before his name is enrolled <lb/>
            among the citizens of that state, dwells among the encyclical <lb/>
            studies, in order that through their instrumentality he may <lb/>
            make his approaches at liberty towards perfect virtue.</p>
          <p>After that, when he saw that be was now become perfect, <lb/>
            and was now able to become a father, although he himself was <lb/>
            full of gratitude towards those studies, by means of which he <lb/>
            had been recommended to virtue, and thought it hard to <lb/>
            renounce them; he was well inclined to be appeased by an <lb/>
            oracle from God which laid this command on him. " In <lb/>
            everything which Sarah says, do thou obey her voice." ¶Let <lb/>
            that be a law to every one of us to do whatever seems good to <lb/>
            virtue; for if we are willing to submit to everything which <lb/>
            virtue recommends we shall be happy. <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxv. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis xxi. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus i. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> || Genesis xvi. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus iiL 17. </note><note type="footnote"> IF Genesis xxi. 11. </note> <pb n="173"/>
            </p>
          <p>LXXXVIII. And the expression, " And thou eatest of the <lb/>
            tree of which alone I commanded thee that thou shouldst not <lb/>
            eat,''* is equivalent to saying, You made a covenant with <lb/>
            wickedness, which you ought to have repelled with all your <lb/>
            strength. On this account, " Cursed art thou;" not, cursed <lb/>
            is the earth for thy works. What, now, is the reason of this ? <lb/>
            That serpent, pleasure, which is an irrational elevation of the <lb/>
            soul, this is intrinsically accursed in its own nature ; and being <lb/>
            such, attaches itself only to the wicked man, and to no good <lb/>
            mail. But Adam is the intermediate sort of mind which at <lb/>
            one time if investigated is found to be good, and at another <lb/>
            time bad; for inasmuch as it is mind, it is not by nature <lb/>
            either good or bad, but from contact with virtue or with vice, <lb/>
            it frequently changes for the better or for the worse ; therefore <lb/>
            it very naturally is not accursed of its own nature, as neither <lb/>
            being itself wickedness nor acting according to wickedness, <lb/>
            but the earth is accursed in its works: for the actions which <lb/>
            proceed from the entire soul, which he calls the earth, are open <lb/>
            to blame and devoid of innocence, inasmuch as he does every­ <lb/>
            thing in accordance with vice. In reference to which fact <lb/>
            God adds, that " In sorrow thou shalt eat of .it." Which is <lb/>
            equivalent to saying, you shall enjoy your soul in sorrow ; for <lb/>
            the wicked man does enjoy his own soul with great pain the <lb/>
            whole of his life, having no legitimate cause for joy ; for such <lb/>
            cause is only produced by justice and prudence, and by the <lb/>
            virtues which are enthroned as companions with them.</p>
          <p>LXXXIX. " Thorns, therefore, and thistles shall it bring <lb/>
            forth to you." But what is it which is produced and <lb/>
            which shoots up in the soul of the foolish man except the <lb/>
            passions which goad and sting and wound it ? Which Moses <lb/>
            here, speaking symbolically, calls thorns, and which irrational <lb/>
            appetite rushes upon at first like fire, and so hastens to meet, <lb/>
            and afterwards uniting itself to them, it consumes and destroys <lb/>
            all its own nature and actions. For Moses speaks thus :— <lb/>
            " But if fire when it has gone forth finds thorns, and shall also <lb/>
            burn a threshing-floor, or a crop of wheat, or a field of corn, <lb/>
            then he who kindled the fire shall pay the damage." t You <lb/>
            see therefore when it has gone forth, that is to say, irrational <lb/>
            impetuosity, it does not only burn the thorns, but finds them : <lb/>
            for being inclined to seek out the passions, it attains to what it <note type="footnote"> I * Genesis iiL 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="174"/>
            has been desiring to find; but when it has found it, it <lb/>
            consumes these three things,-perfect virtue, improvement, <lb/>
            and goodness of disposition. Moses therefore here compares <lb/>
            virtue to a threshing-floor; for as the crops when collected are <lb/>
            brought to the threshing-floor, so also are the good things <lb/>
            which exist in the soul of the wise man brought to virtue ; and <lb/>
            improvement he likens to the crop of wheat, inasmuch as <lb/>
            both the one and the other are imperfect, aiming at the end; <lb/>
            and goodness of disposition he compares to a field of corn, <lb/>
            because it is well adapted to receive the seeds of virtue ; <lb/>
            and each of the passions he calls thistles (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τριβόλια</foreign>), because <lb/>
            they are divisible into three parts: the passion itself, the <lb/>
            efficient cause, and the effect which arises from the combined <lb/>
            operation of the two. As for instance pleasure, what is pleasant, <lb/>
            and the being pleased; appetite, the object of appetite, and the <lb/>
            indulgence of appetite ; pain, what is painful, and the suffering <lb/>
            pain ; fear, what is fearful, and the being in a state of fear.</p>
          <p>XC. " And thou shalt eat the herb of the field; in the <lb/>
            sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy bread." He here speaks <lb/>
            of the herb of the field and of bread, as if they were synony­ <lb/>
            mous, or identical with one another. The herb of the field is <lb/>
            the food of the irrational animal; but the irrational animal is <lb/>
            a worthless creature, which has been deprived of right reason. <lb/>
            The outward senses are also irrational, though they are part of <lb/>
            the soul. But the mind, which is eager for the attainment of <lb/>
            those things which are the objects of the outward sense by <lb/>
            means of the irrational outward senses, does not attain its <lb/>
            desires without labour and sweat; for the life of the foolish <lb/>
            man is very full of distress and very burdensome, since he <lb/>
            is always aiming at and greedily coveting the things which give <lb/>
            pleasure, and all such things as wickedness is wont to do.</p>
          <p>And how long shall this last? "Until," says God, "you <lb/>
            return to the dust from which you were taken." For is he not <lb/>
            now ranked among the things of the earth, and among things <lb/>
            which have no consistency, ever since he deserted the wisdom <lb/>
            which is from heaven? We must consider therefore to what <lb/>
            point he is coming back; but may we not consider whether <lb/>
            what he says has not some such meaning as this, that the <lb/>
            foolish mind is at all times averted from right reason, and that <lb/>
            it has been originally taken not from any sublime nature, but <lb/>
            from some more earthly material, and whether it is stationary, <lb/>
             <pb n="175"/>
            or whether it is in motion, it is always the same, and desirous <lb/>
            of the same objects. On which account, God adds that, <lb/>
            " Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." And this <lb/>
            is equivalent to what has been said before.</p>
          <p>Moreover this sentence also signifies, the beginning and <lb/>
            the end are one and the same thing. For there hadst thou <lb/>
            beginning in the perishable bodies of the earth; and again, <lb/>
            thou shalt end. in them, during the interval of your life, <lb/>
            between its beginning and its end, passing along a road which <lb/>
            is not plain and easy, but rough, full of briars and thorns, the <lb/>
            nature of which is to tear and wound thee.</p>

          <p>I. " AND God cast out Adam, and placed him opposite the <lb/>
            paradise of happiness ; and he placed there the cherubim and <lb/>
            a flaming sword, which turned every way, to keep the way <lb/>
            of the tree of life.*</p>
          <p>In this place Moses uses the expression, He cast out," <lb/>
            but previously he said, "He sent out," not using the various <lb/>
            expressions at random, but being well aware with reference to <lb/>
            what parts he was employing them with propriety and felicity. <lb/>
            Now a man who is sent out is not hindered from returning at <lb/>
            some subsequent time; but he who is cast out by God must <lb/>
            endure an eternal banishment, for it is granted to him who <lb/>
            has not yet been completely and violently taken prisoner by <lb/>
            wickedness, to repent, and so to return back to virtue, from <lb/>
            which he has been driven, as to his great country; but he who <lb/>
            is weighed down by, and wholly subjected to, a violent and <lb/>
            incurable disease, must bear his misfortunes for ever, being <lb/>
            for all times unalterably cast out into the place of the wicked, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iii. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="176"/>
            that there he may endure unmitigated and everlasting misery.* <lb/>
            Since we see Agar,t by whom we understand the middle kind <lb/>
            of instruction which is confined to the encyclical system, twice <lb/>
            going forth from Sarah, who is the symbol of predominant <lb/>
            virtue, and once returning back by the same road, inasmuch <lb/>
            as after she had fled the first time, without being banished by <lb/>
            her mistress, she returned to see her master's house, having <lb/>
            been met by an angel, as the holy scriptures read : but the <lb/>
            second time, she is utterly cast out, and is never to be brought <lb/>
            back again.</p>
          <p>II. And we must speak of the causes of her first flight, <lb/>
            and then again of her second perpetual banishment.</p>
          <p>Before the names of the two were changed, that is to say, <lb/>
            before they had been altered for the better as to the charac­ <lb/>
            teristics of their souls, and had been endowed with better <lb/>
            dispositions, but while the name of the man was still Abram, <lb/>
            or the sublime father, who delighted in the lofty philosophy <lb/>
            which investigates the events which take place in the air, and <lb/>
            the sublime nature of the beings which exist in heaven, <lb/>
            which mathematical science claims for itself as the most <lb/>
            excellent part of natural philosophy, and the name of the <lb/>
            woman was still Sarai; the symbol of my authority, for she <lb/>
            is called my authority, and she had not yet changed her nature <lb/>
            so as to become generic virtue, and all genus is imperishable, <lb/>
            but was as yet classed among things particular and things in <lb/>
            species; that is to say, such as the prudence which is in me, <lb/>
            the temperance which is in me, the courage, the justice, and so <lb/>
            on in the same manner; and these particular virtues are <lb/>
            perishable, because the place which receives them, that is to <lb/>
            say I, am also perishable. Then Agar, who is the middle kind <lb/>
            of encyclical instruction, even if she should endeavour to <lb/>
            escape from the austere and stern life of the lovers of virtue, <lb/>
            will again return to it, since it is not, as yet, able to receive the <lb/>
            generic and imperishable excellencies of virtue, but can only <lb/>
            touch the particular virtues, and such as are spoken of in <lb/>
            species, in which it is sufficient to attain to mediocrity instead <lb/>
            of extreme perfection.</p>
          <p>But when Abram, instead of an inquirer into natural <lb/>
            philosophy, became a wise man and a lover of God, having <lb/>
            his name changed to Abraham, which being interpreted means <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvi. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxi. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="177"/>
            the great father of sounds ; for language when uttered sounds, <lb/>
            and the father of language is the mind, which has attained to <lb/>
            what is virtuous. And when Sarai instead of being ray <lb/>
            authority, had her name also changed to Sarah, the meaning <lb/>
            of which is princess, and this change is equivalent to <lb/>
            becoming generic and imperishable virtue, instead of virtue <lb/>
            special and perishable : then will arise the genus of happiness <lb/>
            that is to say, Isaac; and he, when all the feminine affections * <lb/>
            have ceased, and when the passion of joy and cheerfulness are <lb/>
            dead, will eagerly pursue, not childish amusements, but divine <lb/>
            objects ; then too those elementary branches of instruction <lb/>
            which bear the name of Agar, will be cast out, and their <lb/>
            sophistical child will also be cast out, who is named. Ishmael.</p>
          <p>III. And they shall undergo eternal banishment, God <lb/>
            himself confirming their expulsion, when he bids the wise man <lb/>
            obey the word spoken by Sarah, and she urges him expressly <lb/>
            to cast out the serving woman and her son ; and it is good to <lb/>
            be guided by virtue, and especially so when it teaches such <lb/>
            lessons as this, that the most perfect natures are very greatly <lb/>
            different from the mediocre habits, and that wisdom is a wholly <lb/>
            different thing from sophistry; for the one labours to devise <lb/>
            what is persuasive for the establishment of a false opinion, <lb/>
            which is pernicious to the soul, but wisdom, with long <lb/>
            meditation on the truth by the knowledge of right reason, <lb/>
            brings real advantage to the intellect. Why then do we wonder <lb/>
            if God once for all banished Adam, that is to say, the mind out <lb/>
            of the district of the virtues, after he had once contracted folly, <lb/>
            that incurable disease, and if he never permitted him again <lb/>
            to return, when he also drives out and banishes from wisdom <lb/>
            and from the wise man every sophist, and the mother of <lb/>
            sophists, the teaching that is of elementary instruction, while <lb/>
            he calls the names of wisdom and of the wise man Abraham, <lb/>
            and Sarah.</p>
          <p>IV. Then also, " The flaming sword and the cherubim have <lb/>
            an abode allotted to them exactly in front of paradise." The <lb/>
            expression, " in front," is used partly to convey the idea of a <lb/>
            resisting enemy, and partly as suitable to the notion of judg­ <lb/>
            ment, as a person whose cause is being decided appears in <lb/>
            front of his judge: partly also in a friendly sense, in order <note type="footnote"> * The Greek text here is corrupt and unintelligible. I have followed <lb/>
            the Latin translation of Mangey. </note> <note type="footnote"> VOL. I. </note> <note type="footnote"> N </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="178"/>
            that they may be perceived, and may be considered in closer <lb/>
            connection by reason of the more accurate view of them that <lb/>
            is thus obtained, just as archetypal pictures and statues are <lb/>
            placed in front of painters and statuaries.</p>
          <p>Now the first example of an enemy placed directly in front <lb/>
            of one is derived from what is said in the case of Cain, that <lb/>
            " he went out from the face of God, and dwelt in the land of <lb/>
            Nod, in the front of Eden."* Now Nod being interpreted <lb/>
            means commotion, and Eden means delight. The one there­ <lb/>
            fore is a symbol of wickedness agitating the soul, and the other <lb/>
            of virtue which creates for the soul a state of tranquillity and <lb/>
            happiness, not meaning by happiness that effeminate luxury <lb/>
            which is derived from the indulgence of the irrational passion <lb/>
            of pleasure, but a joy free from toil and free from hardship, <lb/>
            which is enjoyed with great tranquillity. And it follows of <lb/>
            necessity that when the mind goes forth from any imagination <lb/>
            of God, by which it would be good and expedient for it to be <lb/>
            supported, then immediately, after the fashion of a ship, which <lb/>
            is tossed in the sea, when the winds oppose it with great vio­ <lb/>
            lence, it is tossed about in every direction, having disturbance as <lb/>
            it were for its country and its home, a thing which is the most <lb/>
            contrary of all things to steadiness of soul, which is engendered <lb/>
            by joy, which is a term synonymous with Eden.</p>
          <p>V. Now of the kind of opposition of place which is connected <lb/>
            with standing in front of a judge for judgment, we have an <lb/>
            example in the case of the woman who has been suspected of <lb/>
            having committed adultery. For, says Moses, " the priest <lb/>
            shall cause the woman to stand in front of her lord, and she <lb/>
            shall uncover her head."* Let us now examine what he <lb/>
            intends to show by this direction.</p>
          <p>It often happens that what ought to be done is not done, in <lb/>
            the manner in which it ought to be done, and sometimes too <lb/>
            that which is not proper is nevertheless done in a proper <lb/>
            manner. For instance, when the return of a deposit is not <lb/>
            made in an honest spirit, but is intended either to work the <lb/>
            injury of him who receives it back again, or by way of a snare <lb/>
            to bear out a denial in the case of another deposit of greater <lb/>
            value, in that case a proper action is done in an improper <lb/>
            manner. On the other hand, for a physician not to tell the <lb/>
            exact truth to a sick patient, when he has decided on purging <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers v. IS. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="179"/>
            him, or performing some operation with the knife or with the <lb/>
            cautery for the benefit of the patient, lest if the sick man were <lb/>
            to be moved too strongly by the anticipation of the suffering, he <lb/>
            might refuse to submit to the cure, or through weakness of <lb/>
            mind might despair of its succeeding; or in the case of a wise <lb/>
            man giving false information to the enemy to secure the safety <lb/>
            of his country, fearing lest through his speaking the truth the <lb/>
            affairs of the adversaries-should succeed, in this case an action <lb/>
            which is not intrinsically right is done in a proper manner.</p>
          <p>In reference to which distinction Moses says, " to pursue <lb/>
            what is just justly,"* as if it were possible also to pursue it <lb/>
            unjustly, if at any time the judge who gives sentence does not <lb/>
            decide in an honest spirit. Since therefore what is said or done <lb/>
            is openly notorious to all men, but since the intention, the <lb/>
            consequence of which what is said is said, and what is done is <lb/>
            done, is not notorious, but it is uncertain whether it be a sound <lb/>
            and healthy motive, or an unhealthy design, stained with <lb/>
            numerous pollutions; and since no created being is capable of <lb/>
            discerning the secret intention of an invisible mind, but God <lb/>
            alone; in reference to this Moses says that " all secret things <lb/>
            are known to the Lord God, but only such as are manifest are <lb/>
            known to the creature." And therefore it is enjoined to the <lb/>
            priest and prophet, that is to say to reason, " to place the <lb/>
            soul in front of God, with the head uncovered,"t that is to say <lb/>
            the soul must be laid bare as to its principal design, and the <lb/>
            sentiments which it nourished must be revealed, in order that <lb/>
            being brought before the judgment seat of the most accurate <lb/>
            vision of the incorruptible God, it may be thoroughly examined <lb/>
            as to all its concealed disguises, like a base coin, or, on the <lb/>
            other hand, if it be found to be free from all participation in <lb/>
            any kind of wickedness, it may wash away all the calumnies <lb/>
            that have been uttered against its bringing him for a testimony <lb/>
            to its purity, who is alone able to behold the soul naked.</p>
          <p>VI. This, then, is the meaning of coming in front of one's <lb/>
            judge, when brought up for judgment. But the case of coming <lb/>
            in front of any one which has a bearing upon connection or <lb/>
            familiarity, may be illustrated by the example of the all-wise <lb/>
            Abraham. " For," says Moses, " he was still standing in front <lb/>
            of God." ‡ And a proof of his familiarity is contained in the <lb/>
            expression that "he came near to God, and spoke." For it <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xvi. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers v. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> N 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="180"/>
            is fitting for one who has no connection with another to stand <lb/>
            at a distance, and to be separated from him, but he who is <lb/>
            connected with him should stand near to him. And to stand, <lb/>
            and to have an unchangeable mind comes very near to the <lb/>
            power of God, since the Divinity is unchangeable, but that <lb/>
            which is created is intrinsically and essentially changeable. <lb/>
            Therefore, if any one, restraining the changeableness natural <lb/>
            to all created things by his love of knowledge, has been able to <lb/>
            put such violence on any thing as to cause it to stand firm, <lb/>
            let him be sure that he has come near to the happiness of the <lb/>
            Deity.</p>
          <p>But God very appropriately assigns to the cherubim and to <lb/>
            the flaming sword a city or abode in front of Paradise, not as <lb/>
            to enemies about to oppose and to fight him, but rather as to <lb/>
            near connections and friends, in order that in consequence of <lb/>
            a continued sight and contemplation of one another, the two <lb/>
            powers might conceive an affection for one another, the all­ <lb/>
            bounteous God inspiring them with a winged and heavenly <lb/>
            love.</p>
          <p>VII. But we must now consider what the figurative allu­ <lb/>
            sions are which are enigmatically expressed in the mention of <lb/>
            the cherubim and of the flaming sword which turned every <lb/>
            way. May we not say that Moses here introduces under a <lb/>
            figure an intimation of the revolutions of the whole heaven? <lb/>
            For the spheres in heaven received a motion in opposite direc­ <lb/>
            tions to one another, the one sphere receiving a fixed motion <lb/>
            towards the right hand, but the sphere of the other side <lb/>
            receiving a wandering motion towards the left. But that <lb/>
            outermost circle of what are called the fixed stars is one sphere, <lb/>
            which also proceeds in a fixed periodical revolution from east to <lb/>
            west. But the interior circle of the seven planets, whose course <lb/>
            is at the same time compulsory and voluntary, has two motions, <lb/>
            which are to a certain degree contrary to one another. And one <lb/>
            of these motions is involuntary, like that of the planets. For <lb/>
            they appear every day proceeding onwards from the east to <lb/>
            the west. But their peculiar and voluntary motion is from <lb/>
            west to east, according to which last motion we find that the <lb/>
            periods of the seven planets have received their exact measure <lb/>
            of time, moving on in an equal course, as the Sun, and Luci­ <lb/>
            fer, and what is called Stilbon. For these three planets are <lb/>
            of equal speed; but some of the others are unequal in point of <lb/>
             <pb n="181"/>
            time, but preserve a certain sort of relative proportion to one <lb/>
            another and to the other three which have been mentioned.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, by one of the cherubim is understood the <lb/>
            extreme outermost circumference of the entire heaven, in which <lb/>
            the fixed stars celebrate their truly divine dance, which always <lb/>
            proceeds on similar principles and is always the same, without <lb/>
            ever leaving the order which the Father, who created them, <lb/>
            appointed for them in the world.</p>
          <p>But the other of the cherubim is the inner sphere which is <lb/>
            contained within that previously mentioned, which God origin­ <lb/>
            ally divided in two parts, and created seven orbits, bearing a <lb/>
            certain definite proportion to one another, and he adapted each <lb/>
            of the planets to one of these ; and then, having placed each <lb/>
            of these stars in its proper orbit, like a driver in a chariot, he <lb/>
            did not entrust the reins to any one of them, fearing that some <lb/>
            inharmonious sort of management might be the result, but he <lb/>
            made them all to depend upon himself, thinking that, by that <lb/>
            arrangement, the character of their motion would be rendered <lb/>
            most harmonious. For every thing which exists in combina­ <lb/>
            tion with God is deserving of praise; but every thing which <lb/>
            exists without him is faulty.</p>
          <p>VIII. This, then, is one of the systems, acccording to which <lb/>
            what is said of the cherubim may be understood allegorically. <lb/>
            But we must suppose that the sword, consisting of flame and <lb/>
            always turning in every direction, intimates their motion and <lb/>
            the everlasting agitation of the entire heaven. And may we <lb/>
            not say, according to another way of understanding this alle­ <lb/>
            gory, that the two cherubim are meant as symbols of each of <lb/>
            the hemispheres ? For they say that they stand face to face. <lb/>
            inclining towards the mercy-seat; since the two hemispheres <lb/>
            are also exactly opposite to one another, and incline towards <lb/>
            the earth which is the centre of the whole universe, by which, <lb/>
            also, they are kept apart from one another.</p>
          <p>But the only one of all the parts of the world that stands <lb/>
            firmly was most appropriately named Vesta* by the ancients, <lb/>
            in order that there might be an excellently arranged revolu­ <lb/>
            tion of the two hemispheres around some object firmly fixed <lb/>
            in the middle. And the flaming sword is a symbol of the sun ; <lb/>
            for as he is a collection of an immense body of flame, he is <note type="footnote"> * In Greek '<foreign xml:lang="grc">Εστίη</foreign>, as standing (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἑστω̃α</foreign>.) </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="182"/>
            the swiftest of all existing things, to such a degree that in one <lb/>
            day he revolves round the whole world.</p>
          <p>IX. I have also, on one occasion, heard a more ingenious <lb/>
            train of reasoning from my own soul, which was accustomed <lb/>
            frequently to be seized with a certain divine inspiration, even <lb/>
            concerning matters which it could not explain even to itself; <lb/>
            which now, if I am able to remember it accurately, I will <lb/>
            relate. It told me that in the one living and true God there <lb/>
            were two supreme and primary powers-goodness and authority ; <lb/>
            and that by his goodness he had created every thing, and by <lb/>
            his authority he governed all that he had created; and that <lb/>
            the third thing which was between the two, and had the effect <lb/>
            of bringing them together was reason, for that it was owing to <lb/>
            reason that God was both a ruler and good.</p>
          <p>Now, of this ruling authority and of this goodness, being two <lb/>
            distinct powers, the cherubim were the symbols, but of reason <lb/>
            the flaming sword was the symbol. For reason is a thing <lb/>
            capable of rapid motion and impetuous, and especially the <lb/>
            reason of the Creator of all things is so, inasmuch as it was <lb/>
            before everything and passed by everything, and was conceived <lb/>
            before everything, and appears in everything. And do thou, <lb/>
            0 my mind, receive the impression of each of these cherubims <lb/>
            unadulterated, that thus becoming thoroughly instructed about <lb/>
            the ruling authority of the Creator of all things and about his <lb/>
            goodness, thou mayest receive a happy inheritance ; for imme­ <lb/>
            diately thou shalt understand the conjunction and combination <lb/>
            of these imperishable powers, and learn in what respects God <lb/>
            is good, his majesty arising from his sovereign power being <lb/>
            all the time conspicuous; and in what he is powerful, his <lb/>
            goodness, being equally the object of attention, that in this <lb/>
            way thou mayest attain to the virtues which are engendered <lb/>
            by these conceptions, namely, a love and a reverential awe of <lb/>
            God, neither being uplifted to arrogance by any prosperity <lb/>
            which may befall thee, having regard always to the greatness <lb/>
            of the sovereignty of thy King; nor abjectly giving up hope of <lb/>
            better things in the hour of unexpected misfortune, having <lb/>
            regard, then, to the mercifulness of thy great and bounteous <lb/>
            God. And let the flaming sword teach thee that these things <lb/>
            might be followed by a prompt and fiery reason combined with <lb/>
            action, which never ceases being in motion with rapidity and <lb/>
             <pb n="183"/>
            energy to the selection of good objects, and the avoidance of <lb/>
            all such as are evil.</p>
          <p>X. Do you not see that even the wise Abraham, when he <lb/>
            began to measure everything with a reference to God, and <lb/>
            to leave nothing to the creature, took an imitation of the <lb/>
            flaming sword, namely, " fire and a sword,"* being eager to <lb/>
            slay and to burn that mortal creature which was born of him, <lb/>
            that so being raised on high it might soar up to God, the <lb/>
            intellect being thus disentangled from the body.</p>
          <p>Moses also represents Balaam, who is the symbol of a vain <lb/>
            people, stripped of his arms, as a runaway and deserter, well <lb/>
            knowing the war which it becomes the soul to' carry on for <lb/>
            the sake of knowledge; for he says to his ass, who is here <lb/>
            a symbol of the irrational designs of life which every foolish <lb/>
            man entertains, that " If I had had a sword, I should ere <lb/>
            now have slain thee."† And great thanks are due to the <lb/>
            Maker of all things, because he, knowing the struggles and <lb/>
            resistance of folly, did not give to it the power of language, <lb/>
            which would have been like giving a sword to a madman, <lb/>
            in order that it might have no power to work great and <lb/>
            iniquitous destruction among all whom it should meet with. <lb/>
            But the reproaches which Balaam utters are in some degree <lb/>
            expressed by all those who are not purified, but are always <lb/>
            talking foolishly, devoting themselves to the life of a merchant, <lb/>
            or of a farmer, or to some other business, the object of which is <lb/>
            to provide the things necessary for life. As long, indeed, as <lb/>
            everything goes on prosperously with respect to each indi­ <lb/>
            vidual, he mounts his animal joyfully and rides on cheerfully, <lb/>
            and holding the reins firmly he will by no means consent to let <lb/>
            them go. And if any one advises him to dismount and to set <lb/>
            bounds to his appetites, because of his inability to know what <lb/>
            will befall him hereafter, he reproaches him with jealousy and <lb/>
            envy, saying that he does not address him in this way out of <lb/>
            good will. But when any unexpected misfortune overtakes <lb/>
            him, he then looks upon those who have given him warning as <lb/>
            good prophets and men able, above all others, to foresee the <lb/>
            future, and lays the blame of his distress on what is absolutely <lb/>
            the cause of no evil whatever, on agriculture, on commerce, or <lb/>
            on any other pursuit which he may have thought fit to select <lb/>
            for the purpose of making money. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxii. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxii. 29. </note> <pb n="184"/>
            </p>
          <p>XI. But these pursuits, although they are destitute of the <lb/>
            organs of speech, will, nevertheless, through the medium of <lb/>
            actions, utter a language clearer than any speech which pro­ <lb/>
            ceeds from the tongue, and will say, " 0 you sycophant and <lb/>
            false accuser, are not we the pursuits which you mounted upon <lb/>
            holding your head high, as you might have mounted upon a <lb/>
            beast of burden ? And have we, by any insolence or obstinacy <lb/>
            of ours, caused you any suffering ? Behold reason armed and <lb/>
            standing in opposition to God, by whom all good and all bad <lb/>
            fortune is brought to its accomplishment. Do you not see it ? <lb/>
            Why, then, do you reproach us now, when you formerly had no <lb/>
            fault to find with us, while your affairs were proceeding pros­ <lb/>
            perously? For we are the same as we were before, having <lb/>
            changed nothing of our nature, not the slightest jot. But you <lb/>
            are now applying tests which have no soundness in them, and <lb/>
            in consequence are unreasonably violent against us ; for if you <lb/>
            had understood from the beginning that it is not the pursuits <lb/>
            which you follow that are the causes of your participation in <lb/>
            good or in evil, but rather the divine reason, which is the <lb/>
            helmsman and governor of the universe, then you would more <lb/>
            easily have borne the events which have befallen you, ceas­ <lb/>
            ing to bring false accusations against us, and to attribute <lb/>
            to us effects which we are unable to produce.</p>
          <p>" If therefore this reason now again, putting an end to that <lb/>
            strife, and dispersing the sad and desponding ideas which arise <lb/>
            from it, should promise you tranquillity of life, you will then <lb/>
            again, with cheerfulness and joy, give us your right hand <lb/>
            though we shall be like what we are now. But we are <lb/>
            neither puffed up by your friendly favour, nor do we think it <lb/>
            of great importance if you are angry with us; for we know <lb/>
            that we are not the causes of either good or evil fortune, not <lb/>
            even if you believe that we are, unless indeed you attribute to <lb/>
            the sea the cause of sailors making favourable voyages, or of <lb/>
            the shipwrecks which at times befall them, and not rather to <lb/>
            the variations of the winds, which blow at one time gently, <lb/>
            and at another with the most violent impetuosity; for as all <lb/>
            water is by its own nature tranquil, accordingly, when a <lb/>
            favourable gale blows upon the stern of a ship, every rope is <lb/>
            bent, and the ship is in full sail, conveying the mariners to the <lb/>
            harbour; but when on a sudden the wind changes to the op­ <lb/>
            posite direction, and blows against the head of the vessel, it <lb/>
             <pb n="185"/>
            then raises a heavy swell and great disturbance in the water, <lb/>
            and upsets the ship; and the sea, which was in no respect the <lb/>
            cause of what has happened is blamed for it, though it no­ <lb/>
            toriously is either calm or stormy according to the gentleness <lb/>
            or violence of the winds." -</p>
          <p>By all these considerations I think it has been abundantly <lb/>
            shown, that nature has made reason the most powerful coad­ <lb/>
            jutor of man, and has made him, who is able to make a proper <lb/>
            use of it, happy and truly rational; but him who has not this <lb/>
            faculty, she has rendered irrational and unhappy.</p>

            legislation bears testimony, he does not represent as knowing <lb/>
            their wives, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and if <lb/>
            there are any others of like zeal with them ; for since we say, <lb/>
            that woman is to be understood symbolically as the outward <lb/>
            sense, and since knowledge consists in alienation from the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense and from the body, it is plain that the lovers of <lb/>
            wisdom must repudiate the outward sense rather than choose <lb/>
            it, and is not this quite natural ? for they who live with these <lb/>
            men are in name indeed wives, but in fact virtues. Sarah is <lb/>
            princess and guide, Rebecca is perseverance in what is good; <lb/>
            Leah again is virtue, fainting and weary at the long continu­ <lb/>
            ance of exertion, which every foolish man declines, and avoids, <lb/>
            aud repudiates; and Zipporah, the wife of Moses, is virtue, <lb/>
            mounting up from earth to heaven, and arriving at a just com­ <lb/>
            prehension of the divine and blessed virtues which exist <lb/>
            there, and she is called a biid.</p>
          <p>But that we may describe the conception and the parturition <lb/>
            of virtues, let the superstitious either stop their ears, or else <lb/>
            let them depart; for we are about to teach those initiated per­ <lb/>
            sons who are worthy of the knowledge of the most sacred mys­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="186"/>
            teries, the whole nature of such divine and secret ordi­ <lb/>
            nances. And those who are thus worthy are they who, with all <lb/>
            modesty, practise genuine piety, of that sort which scorns to <lb/>
            disguise itself under any false colours. But we will not act <lb/>
            the part of hierophant or expounder of sacred mysteries to <lb/>
            those who are afflicted with the incurable disease of pride of <lb/>
            language and quibbling expressions, and juggling tricks of <lb/>
            manners, and who measure sanctity and holiness by no other <lb/>
            standard.</p>
          <p>XIII. But we must begin our explanation of these myste­ <lb/>
            ries in this way. A husband unites with his wife, and the male <lb/>
            human being with the female human being in a union which <lb/>
            tends to the generation of children, in strict accordance with <lb/>
            and obedience to nature. But it is not lawful for virtues, <lb/>
            which are the parents of many perfect things, to associate <lb/>
            with a mortal husband. But they, without having received <lb/>
            the power of generation from any other being, will never be <lb/>
            able by themselves alone to conceive any thing. Who, then, <lb/>
            is it who sows good seed in them, except the Father of the <lb/>
            universe, the uncreated God, he who is the parent of all <lb/>
            things ? This, therefore, is the being who sows, and presently <lb/>
            he bestows his own offspring, which he himself did sow; for <lb/>
            God creates nothing for himself, inasmuch as he is in need of <lb/>
            nothing, but he creates every thing for him who is able to take <lb/>
            it.</p>
          <p>And I will bring forward as a competent witness in proof of <lb/>
            what I have said, the most holy Moses.* For he introduces Sarah <lb/>
            as conceiving a son when God beheld her by himself; but he <lb/>
            represents her as bringing forth her son, not to him who beheld <lb/>
            her then, but to him who was eager to attain to wisdom, and <lb/>
            his name is called Abraham. And he teaches the same lesson <lb/>
            more plainly in the case of Leah, where he says that " God <lb/>
            opened her womb."t But to open the womb is the especial <lb/>
            business of the husband. And she having conceived, brought <lb/>
            forth, not to God, for he alone is sufficient and all-abundant <lb/>
            for himself, but to him who underwent labour for the sake of <lb/>
            that which is good, namely, for Jacob ; so that in this instance <lb/>
            virtue received the divine seed from the great Cause of all <lb/>
            things, but brought forth her offspring to one of her lovers, <lb/>
            who deserved to be preferred to all her other suitors.‡ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxix. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxv. 21. </note> <pb n="187"/>
            </p>
          <p>Again, when the all-wise Isaac addressed his supplications <lb/>
            to God, Rebecca, who is perseverance, became pregnant by the <lb/>
            agency of him who received the supplication; but Moses, who <lb/>
            received Zipporah,* that is to say, winged and sublime virtue, <lb/>
            without any supplication or entreaty on his part, found that <lb/>
            she conceived by no mortal man.</p>
          <p>XIV. Now I bid ye, initiated men, who are purified, as to <lb/>
            your ears, to receive these things, as mysteries which are really <lb/>
            sacred, in your inmost souls; and reveal them not to any <lb/>
            one who is of the number of the uninitiated, but guard them as <lb/>
            a sacred treasure, laying them up in your own hearts, not in a <lb/>
            storehouse in which are gold and silver, perishable substances, <lb/>
            but in that treasure-house in which the most excellent of all <lb/>
            the possessions in the world does lie, the knowledge namely of <lb/>
            the great first Cause, and of virtue, and in the third place, of <lb/>
            the generation of them both. And if ever you meet with any <lb/>
            one who has been properly initiated, cling to that man affec­ <lb/>
            tionately and adhere to him, that if he has learnt any more <lb/>
            recent mystery he may not conceal it from you before you <lb/>
            have learnt to comprehend it thoroughly. For I myself, <lb/>
            having been initiated in the great mysteries by Moses, the <lb/>
            friend of God, nevertheless, when subsequently I beheld Jere­ <lb/>
            miah the prophet, and learnt that he was not only initiated <lb/>
            Into the sacred mysteries, but was also a competent hierophant <lb/>
            or expounder of them, did not hesitate to become his pupil. <lb/>
            And he, like a man very much under the influence of inspira­ <lb/>
            tion, uttered an oracle in the character of God, speaking in this <lb/>
            manner to most peaceful virtue: " Hast thou not called me as <lb/>
            thy house, and thy father, and the husband of thy virginity ?"t <lb/>
            showing by this expression most manifestly that God is both a <lb/>
            house, the incorporeal abode of incorporeal ideas, and the <lb/>
            Father of all things, inasmuch as it is he who has created <lb/>
            them; and the husband of wisdom, sowing for the race of <lb/>
            mankind the seed of happiness in good and virgin soil. For <lb/>
            it is fitting for God to converse with an unpolluted and un­ <lb/>
            touched and pure nature, in truth and reality virgin, in a <lb/>
            different manner from that in which we converse with such. <lb/>
            For the association of men, with a view to the procreation of <lb/>
            children, makes virgins women. But when God begins to <lb/>
            associate with the soul, he makes that which was previously <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Jeremiah iii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="188"/>
            woman now again virgin. Since banishing and destroying all <lb/>
            the degenerate appetites unbecoming a human being, by which <lb/>
            it had been made effeminate, he introduces in their stead <lb/>
            genuine, and perfect, and unadulterated virtues; therefore, he <lb/>
            will not converse with Sarah before all the habits, such as other <lb/>
            women have, have left her,. and till she has returned into the <lb/>
            class of pure virgins.</p>
          <p>XV. But it is, perhaps, possible that in some cases a virgin <lb/>
            soul may be polluted by intemperate passions, and so become <lb/>
            impure. On which account the sacred oracle has been cautious, <lb/>
            calling God the husband, not of a virgin, for a virgin is subject <lb/>
            to change and to mortality, but of virginity; of an idea, that is <lb/>
            to say, which is always existing in the same principles and in <lb/>
            the same manner. For as all things endowed with distinctive <lb/>
            qualities are by nature liable to origination and to destruction, <lb/>
            so those archetypal powers, which are the makers of those par­ <lb/>
            ticular things, have received an imperishable inheritance in <lb/>
            their turn. Therefore is it seemly that the uncreated and <lb/>
            unchangeable God should ever sow the ideas of immortal and <lb/>
            virgin virtues in a woman who is transformed into the appear­ <lb/>
            ance of virginity ? Why, then, 0 soul, since it is right for you <lb/>
            to dwell as a virgin in the house of God, and to cleave to wis­ <lb/>
            dom, do you stand aloof from these things, and rather embrace <lb/>
            the outward sense, which makes you effeminate and pollutes <lb/>
            you ? Therefore, you shall bring forth an offspring altogether <lb/>
            polluted and altogether destructive, the fratricidal and accursed <lb/>
            Cain, a possession not to be sought after ; for the name Cain <lb/>
            being interpreted means possession.</p>
          <p>XVI. And one may wonder at the kind of narration which <lb/>
            the Jewish lawgiver frequently employs in many instances, <lb/>
            where he departs from the usual style. For after giving the <lb/>
            history of those parents of the human race who were created <lb/>
            out of the earth, he begins to relate the story of the first-born <lb/>
            of human parents, concerning whom he says absolutely nothing, <lb/>
            as if he had already frequently mentioned his name, and were <lb/>
            not now bringing it forward for the first time. Accordingly, <lb/>
            he simply says that " she brought forth Cain." What sort of <lb/>
            being was he, 0 writer; and what have you ever said about <lb/>
            him before of either great or small importance? And yet you <lb/>
            are not ignorant of the importance of a proper application of <note type="footnote">* Genesis xviii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="189"/>
            names. For before this time, as you proceed in your history, <lb/>
            you show this, when speaking in reference to the same person <lb/>
            you say, "And Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived <lb/>
            and brought forth a son, and she called his name Seth."* <lb/>
            Therefore it was much more necessary in the case of the first­ <lb/>
            horn, who was the beginning of the generation of men from one <lb/>
            another, to display the nature of him who was thus conceived <lb/>
            and born, in the first place showing that he was a male child, <lb/>
            and secondly mentioning his peculiar name, Cain. Since, <lb/>
            therefore, it was not owing to inexperience or to ignorance of <lb/>
            according to what persons he ought to give names, that he <lb/>
            appears to have discarded his usual practice in the case of <lb/>
            Cain, we must now consider on what account he thus named <lb/>
            those who were born of our first parents, rather mentioning <lb/>
            the name in an incidental way than actually giving it. And <lb/>
            the cause, as it appears to me, according to the best conjecture <lb/>
            that I can form, is this.</p>
          <p>XVII. All the rest of the human race gives names to <lb/>
            things which are different from the things themselves, so that <lb/>
            the thing which we see is one thing, but the name which we <lb/>
            give it is another; but in the history of Moses the names <lb/>
            which he affixes to things are the most conspicuous energies of <lb/>
            the things themselves, so that the thing itself is at once of <lb/>
            necessity its name, and is in no respect different from the <lb/>
            name which is imposed on it. And you may learn this more <lb/>
            clearly from the previous example which I have mentioned. <lb/>
            When the mind which is in us, and let it be called Adam, meet­ <lb/>
            in,, with the outward sense, according to which all living <lb/>
            creatures appear to exist (and that is called Eve), having <lb/>
            conceived a desire for connection, is associated with this out­ <lb/>
            ward sense, that one conceives as in a net, and hunts after <lb/>
            the external object of outward sense naturally. For by means <lb/>
            of the eyes it arrives at a conception of colour, by the ears it <lb/>
            conceives sound, by the nostrils it arrives at a conception of <lb/>
            smells, of flavours by the organs of taste, and of all substance <lb/>
            by those of touch; and having thus conceived it becomes preg­ <lb/>
            nant, and immediately it is in labour, and brings forth the great­ <lb/>
            est of all the evils of the soul, namely, vain opinion, for it con­ <lb/>
            ceives an opinion that everything that it has seen, that it has <lb/>
            heard, that it has tasted, that it has smelled, or that it has <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv.'25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="190"/>
            touched, belongs to itself, and it looks upon itself as the <lb/>
            inventor and creator of them all.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And there is nothing unnatural in its receiving this <lb/>
            impression, for there was a time once when the mind had no <lb/>
            conversation with the outward sense, and had no outward sense, <lb/>
            being very far removed from all things which were gregarious <lb/>
            and in the habit of associating together, and itself resembling <lb/>
            those solitary animals which feed by themselves. Accordingly <lb/>
            as at that time it was classed by itself it did not touch any <lb/>
            body, inasmuch as it had no organ in itself by which to take <lb/>
            hold of external objects, but it was blind, and devoid of power, <lb/>
            not being such a being as most people call a person when they <lb/>
            see any one deprived of his eyes, for such a person is destitute <lb/>
            of only one external sense, and has great and abundant vigour <lb/>
            in the others. But this mind, being curtailed of all the facul­ <lb/>
            ties which are derived from the outward senses, and being <lb/>
            really powerless, being but the half of a perfect soul, destitute <lb/>
            of the faculty by which it might naturally be able to conceive <lb/>
            bodies, being but a fragment of itself, deprived of its kindred <lb/>
            organs, and as such unfortunately is wholly deprived of these or­ <lb/>
            gans of the external senses on which it might rely as on a staff, <lb/>
            and by which it might have been able to support itself when <lb/>
            tottering. From which cause a great darkness is spread over <lb/>
            all bodies, so that nothing can be visible through it; for there <lb/>
            was no outward sense by which things could be distinguished.</p>
          <p>God therefore, wishing to give it the faculty of comprehend­ <lb/>
            in,, not only incorporeal but also solid bodies, filled up the <lb/>
            entire soul, attaching a second portion to that which he had <lb/>
            already created, which he called appellatively woman, and by <lb/>
            an especial name Eve, intimating the outward sense by a <lb/>
            metaphorical expression.</p>
          <p>XIX. And she, the first moment that she was born, pours <lb/>
            forth abundant light in a flood into the mind through each of <lb/>
            her subordinate parts, as through so many holes, and having <lb/>
            dissipated the previously existing mist, enabled it like a master <lb/>
            to discern the natures of bodies at a distance and with perfect <lb/>
            clearness ; and the mind being now irradiated with light, as if <lb/>
            the beams of the sun had suddenly shone upon it after night, <lb/>
            or as if it had just arisen from a deep sleep, or as if it had <lb/>
            been to see a blind man suddenly restored to sight, came at <lb/>
            once upon all the things with which creation was concerned, <lb/>
             <pb n="191"/>
            heaven, and earth, and water, and air, and plants, and animals, <lb/>
            and their habits, and distinctive qualities, and faculties, and <lb/>
            dispositions, and movements, and energies, and actions, and <lb/>
            changes, and ends; and some things he saw, and some things <lb/>
            lie heard, and some he tasted, and some he smelled, and some <lb/>
            he touched; and towards some be felt an inclination as they <lb/>
            were productive of pleasure, and to some he felt aversion inas­ <lb/>
            much as they caused pain.</p>
          <p>Having therefore looked around it on all sides, and having <lb/>
            contemplated itself and its own faculties, it ventured to utter <lb/>
            the same boast that Alexander the king of the Macedonians <lb/>
            did, for they say that he, when he determined to lay claim to <lb/>
            the supreme dominion over Europe and Asia, stood in a suit­ <lb/>
            able place, and looking around him upon every thing, said. <lb/>
            " All things on this side and all things on that side are mine," <lb/>
            displaying thus the emptiness of soul truly childish and <lb/>
            infantine and foolish, and not at all royal. But the mind, hav­ <lb/>
            ing first laid a claim to the faculties of the outward senses, <lb/>
            and by means of them having conceived every idea of bodily <lb/>
            substance, became filled with unreasonable pride and was <lb/>
            puffed up, so as to think everything in the world its own <lb/>
            property, and that nothing at all belonged to any one else.</p>
          <p>XX. This is that disposition in us which Moses characterised <lb/>
            when he gave Cain his name, a name which being interpreted <lb/>
            means possession, Cain himself being full of all folly or rather <lb/>
            of all impiety; for instead of thinking that all possession <lb/>
            belonged to God, he conceived that they all belonged to himself, <lb/>
            though he was not only not able to possess even himself steadily, <lb/>
            but he did not even know of what essence be consisted; but <lb/>
            nevertheless he placed confidence in the outward senses, as being <lb/>
            competent to attain the objects perceivable only by them.</p>
          <p>Let him tell us therefore how he will be able to avoid seeing <lb/>
            wrongly, or being mistaken as to his hearing, or to escape <lb/>
            even in any other of these outward senses. And in truth it is <lb/>
            inevitable that these errors should continually befall every one <lb/>
            of us, even if we should happen to be endowed with the <lb/>
            most accurately constructed organs possible; for it is difficult, <lb/>
            or I might rather say impossible, for any one completely to <lb/>
            avoid the natural blemishes and involuntary errors which arise, <lb/>
            since the efficient causes of erroneous opinions are innumerable, <lb/>
            both within us and around us, and outside of us, and since <lb/>
             <pb n="192"/>
            they are to be found in every mortal creature, man, therefore, <lb/>
            very improperly conceives every thing to belong to himself, <lb/>
            however proud he may be, and however high he may carry his <lb/>
            head.</p>
          <p>XXI And Laban, who relied greatly on his distinctive quali­ <lb/>
            ties, appears to me to have afforded great amusement to Jacob, <lb/>
            who was beyond all other men, a clear-sighted contemplator of <lb/>
            the nature, which was free from any such qualities, when he <lb/>
            ventured to say to him that, "My daughter, and my sons, and my <lb/>
            cattle, and all that you see, belong to me and to my daughters."* <lb/>
            For adding the word "my " to each of these articles, he never <lb/>
            ceases from speaking and boasting about himself. Your <lb/>
            daughters now, tell me—and they are the arts and sciences of <lb/>
            the soul-do you say that your daughters are your own <lb/>
            property ? How so ? In the first place did you not receive them <lb/>
            from the mind which taught them ? in the second place it is <lb/>
            naturally possible for you to lose these also, as you might lose <lb/>
            anything else, either forgetting them through the greatness of <lb/>
            your other cares, or through severe and lasting sicknesses of <lb/>
            body, or because of the incurable disease which is at all events <lb/>
            destined for those who grow old, namely old age, or through <lb/>
            ten thousand other accidents, the number of which it is <lb/>
            impossible to calculate.</p>
          <p>And what will you say about the sons ?-and the sons are <lb/>
            the reasonings which take place in portions of the soul,-if you <lb/>
            pronounce that the sons belong to you, are you speaking <lb/>
            reasonably, or are you downright mad for thinking so? For <lb/>
            melancholic thoughts, and follies, and frenzies of the mind, <lb/>
            and untrustworthy conjectures, and false ideas about things, <lb/>
            and empty attractions of the mind, resembling dreams, and <lb/>
            bringing with them convulsive agitation, and the disease which <lb/>
            is innate in the soul, namely forgetfulness, and many other <lb/>
            things beyond those that I have mentioned, take away the <lb/>
            stability of your master-like authority, and show that these <lb/>
            arc the possession of some one else and not of you. Again, <lb/>
            what will you say about the cattle ? Now the cattle are the <lb/>
            outward senses, for the outward sense is something un­ <lb/>
            reasonable and brutish, like cattle, will you dare to call the <lb/>
            cattle your property ? Tell me when you see erroneously, when <lb/>
            you constantly hear erroneously, when you at one time think <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 43. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="193"/>
            sweet flavours brackish, and at others look upon bitter flavours <lb/>
            as sweet, when you in fact, in respect of every single one of <lb/>
            these outward senses, are in the habit of being mistaken more <lb/>
            frequently than you come to a correct decision, do you not blush? <lb/>
            and if so, will you give yourself airs, and boast yourself as if <lb/>
            you employed all the faculties and energies of the soul in such <lb/>
            a way as never to err or to be mistaken.</p>
          <p>XXII. But if you were to become changed, and to become <lb/>
            possessed of the senses which you ought to have, you would <lb/>
            then affirm that everything was the property of God, not of <lb/>
            yourself, all conceptions, all knowledge, all art, all speculation, <lb/>
            all particular reasonings, all the outward senses, and all <lb/>
            the energies of the soul, whether exerted by them or without <lb/>
            them; and if you leave yourself throughout the whole of your <lb/>
            life without any instructor, and without any teaching, you will <lb/>
            be a slave for ever to harsh mistresses, such as vain opinions, <lb/>
            appetites, pleasures, acts of injustice, follies, and erroneous <lb/>
            conceptions; " For if," says Moses, " the servant shall answer <lb/>
            and say, I am content with my master, and with my wife, and <lb/>
            with my children, I will not depart and be free, then, being <lb/>
            brought before the judgment-seat of God," and, having him <lb/>
            for his judge, he shall securely have what he asked," <lb/>
            "having first had his ear bored through,"* that he may not <lb/>
            hear the words of God about freedom of soul. For it is a sign <lb/>
            of a mind which is as it were rejected from the sacred contest <lb/>
            and wholly discarded, and of reasoning faculties wholly childish <lb/>
            and deficient, to make a boast of the mind being contented, <lb/>
            and of thinking one's mind one's own lord and benefactor, <lb/>
            and to boast of being very sufficiently pleased with the outward <lb/>
            senses, and of thinking them one's own property, and the <lb/>
            greatest of all good things, and their offspring with them; <lb/>
            the offspring of the mind being to comprehend, to reason, to <lb/>
            discriminate, to will, to conjecture; and the offspring of the <lb/>
            outward sense being to see, to hear, to taste, to smell, to <lb/>
            touch, in short to feel.</p>
          <p>XXIII. It follows inevitably that he who is held in bond­ <lb/>
            age by these two masters can never enjoy even a dream of <lb/>
            freedom ; for it is only by a flight and complete escape from <lb/>
            them that we arrive at a state of freedom from fear. But there <lb/>
            is another man besides him, who is so taken up with himself, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxi. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> O </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="194"/>
            who makes an exhibition of insanity, and says that even if any <lb/>
            one were to take his possessions away from him he would gain <lb/>
            a victory over him, like a man contending for his own pro­ <lb/>
            perty. " For," says he, " I will pursue and will take captive; <lb/>
            I will divide the spoil; I will satisfy my soul, and I will slay <lb/>
            with my sword ; my right hand shall obtain the mastery." *</p>
          <p>To whom I would say, Thou hast forgotten, fool, that every <lb/>
            one who thinks himself at his birth born to be a persecutor, <lb/>
            is persecuted; for diseases, and old age, and death, with all <lb/>
            the rest of the multitude of calamities incurred, voluntarily <lb/>
            and involuntarily, agitate and harass and persecute every one of <lb/>
            us; and he who thinks to take captive or to subdue is himself <lb/>
            taken captive and subdued; and he who expects to carry off <lb/>
            the spoil, and who arranges a distribution of the booty, <lb/>
            is defeated, and becomes subject to the enemies who have <lb/>
            defeated him, receiving emptiness instead of abundance, and <lb/>
            slavery for his soul instead of mastership, and being slain <lb/>
            instead of slaying, and forcibly suffering himself all that he had <lb/>
            designed to do to others. For such a man was truly the enemy <lb/>
            of reason which establishes the truth, and of nature herself, <lb/>
            setting up a claim to everything which was done as his own, <lb/>
            and remembering not one of the things which happened to him <lb/>
            while he was suffering, as if he had escaped all the evils which <lb/>
            could arise from any source whatever.</p>
          <p>XXIV. For, says he, the enemy has said, " I will pursue <lb/>
            and take captive." Who, then, could be a more deter­ <lb/>
            mined enemy to the soul than he who out of arrogance <lb/>
            appropriated the especial attributes of the Deity to himself ? <lb/>
            Now it is an especial attribute of God to create, and this <lb/>
            faculty it is impious to ascribe to any created being. But the <lb/>
            special property of the created being is to suffer; and he who <lb/>
            has previously considered how akin to and inevitable for man <lb/>
            this is, will easily endure everything that befalls him, however <lb/>
            grievous it may be. But if lie thinks that it is inconsistent <lb/>
            with his destiny, then, if he be oppressed with any very terrible <lb/>
            calamity, he will suffer the punishment of Sisyphus, not being <lb/>
            able to raise his head, not even ever so little, but being <lb/>
            exposed to all sorts of evils coming upon him and over­ <lb/>
            whelming him, and meeting them all with submission and <lb/>
            non-resistance, the passions of a degenerate and unmanly <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="195"/>
            soul; for he ought rather to have endured with patience; <lb/>
            still, however, resisting and striving against calamity, strength­ <lb/>
            ening his mind, and raising a bulwark against sorrow by his own <lb/>
            patience and fortitude, which are the most powerful of virtues.</p>
          <p>For as to be shaved is an operation of a twofold nature, as <lb/>
            in the one case the creature shaved is either the active agent <lb/>
            and the passive subject; and in the other case, he does <lb/>
            nothing but yield and submit to the barber: for a sheep is <lb/>
            shorn either of his whole hide, or of that which is called the <lb/>
            pillow; doing nothing of itself, but only suffering at the hands <lb/>
            of another. But man co-operates with the barber, and puts <lb/>
            himself in the proper attitude, and makes himself convenient, <lb/>
            mingling the characters of the subject and the agent. So also <lb/>
            in the case of beating, that may happen either to a servant <lb/>
            who has committed offences worthy of stripes, or to a freeman <lb/>
            who is stretched on the wheel as a punishment for wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, or to some inanimate thing ; for stones and trees are <lb/>
            beaten, and gold and silver, and whatever material is wrought <lb/>
            in a forge, or is cut in two. And to be beaten, also happens <lb/>
            to athletes who contend in boxing, or in the pancratium for <lb/>
            victory and crowns. The boxer parries blows which are <lb/>
            aimed at him with one of his hands, and stooping his neck on <lb/>
            this side and on that side, guards against being struck; and <lb/>
            very often he stands on tiptoe, and raises himself as high as <lb/>
            he can, or else he stoops and contracts himself on the other <lb/>
            hand, and compels his antagonist to waste his blows on the <lb/>
            empty air, very nearly as if he were fighting with a shadow.</p>
          <p>But the servant or the brass, doing' nothing in return, is <lb/>
            subjected to the will of the other party, suffering at his hands <lb/>
            whatever he pleases : let us therefore never admit the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of this passion, neither in our body, nor, what is of <lb/>
            much greater importance, in our soul; but let us rather admit <lb/>
            that feeling which suffers in return, since it is inevitable that <lb/>
            that which is mortal must suffer; so that we may not, like <lb/>
            effeminate persons, broken in spirit, dissolute, and falling to <lb/>
            pieces before our time, be weak through the utter prostration <lb/>
            and relaxation of the powers of the soul, but rather that, being <lb/>
            invigorated in the nerves and tone of our minds, we may be <lb/>
            able to bear cheerfully and easily the rush of such calamities <lb/>
            as may be impending over is.</p>
          <p>Since therefore it has been proved, that no mortal is posi- <note type="footnote"> 0 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="196"/>
            tively and assuredly the master of anything whatever (and <lb/>
            they who are called masters are so in appearance only, and <lb/>
            are not called so in truth), it follows of necessity, that as <lb/>
            there is a subject and a slave, so there must also be a ruler <lb/>
            and lord in the universe, and he must be the true real ruler <lb/>
            and lord, the one God, to whom it was becoming to say, that <lb/>
            " All things belong to him."</p>
          <p>XXV. And let us now consider with what magnificent fit­ <lb/>
            ness and with what divine majesty he speaks of these things. <lb/>
            Let us consider the expression, All things are mine," and <lb/>
            " all things" mean as he says, " gifts, and offerings, and <lb/>
            fruits of labour, which, on watching carefully, ye will bring to <lb/>
            me on the days of my festivals."* Showing, very manifestly, <lb/>
            that of all existing things some are thought worthy of mo­ <lb/>
            derate grace which is called an offering, and some of that <lb/>
            higher grace which is called by the appropriate name of a <lb/>
            free gift. And these things again are of such a nature that <lb/>
            they are able, not only to bring forth virtues as their fruit, <lb/>
            but that good fruit and eatable does actually pervade the <lb/>
            whole of them, by which alone the soul of him who loves con­ <lb/>
            templation is supported; and he who has learnt this lesson, <lb/>
            and who is able to keep and preserve these things in his mind, <lb/>
            will bring to God a faultless and most excellent offering, <lb/>
            namely faith, on the festivals, which are not feasts of mortal <lb/>
            things; for he has assigned feasts also to himself, laying down <lb/>
            this as the most inevitable doctrine to those who are revellers <lb/>
            in philosophy.</p>
          <p>And the doctrine is this: God alone keeps festival in <lb/>
            reality, for he alone rejoices, be alone is delighted, he alone <lb/>
            feels cheerfulness, and to him alone is it given, to pass an <lb/>
            existence of perfect peace unmixed with war. He is free from <lb/>
            all pain, and free from all fear; he has no participation in any <lb/>
            evils, he yields to no one, he suffers no sorrow, he knows no <lb/>
            fatigue, he is full of unalloyed happiness ; his nature is en­ <lb/>
            tirely perfect, or rather God is himself the perfection, and <lb/>
            completion, and boundary of happiness, partaking of nothing <lb/>
            else by which he can be rendered better, but giving to every <lb/>
            individual thing a portion of what is suited to it, from the <lb/>
            fountain of good, namely, from himself; for the beautiful <lb/>
            things in the world would never have been such as they are, <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxviii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="197"/>
            if they had not been made after an archetypal pattern, which <lb/>
            was really beautiful, the uncreate, and blessed, and imperish­ <lb/>
            able model of all things.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And on this account too Moses calls the sabbath, <lb/>
            which name being interpreted means " rest," " the sabbath <lb/>
            of God."* Touching upon the necessary principles of natural <lb/>
            philosophy, not of the philosophy of men, in many parts of his <lb/>
            law, for that among existing things which rests, if one must <lb/>
            tell the truth, is one thing only, God. And by " rest" I do <lb/>
            not mean " inaction" (since that which is by its nature ener­ <lb/>
            getic, that which is the cause of all things, can never desist <lb/>
            from doing what is most excellent), but I mean an energy <lb/>
            completely free from labour, without any feeling of suffering, <lb/>
            and with the most perfect ease; for one may say, without im­ <lb/>
            propriety, that the sun and the moon, and the entire heaven, <lb/>
            and the whole world labour, inasmuch as they are not endowed <lb/>
            with independent power, and are continually in a state of mo­ <lb/>
            tion and agitation, and the most undeniable proofs of their <lb/>
            labour are the yearly seasons; for these things, which have <lb/>
            the greatest tendency in the whole heaven to keep things <lb/>
            together, vary their motions, making their revolutions at one <lb/>
            time northern, at another time southern, and at other times <lb/>
            different from both.</p>
          <p>The air, again, being sometimes warmed and sometimes <lb/>
            cooled, and being capable of every sort of change, is easily <lb/>
            proved to labour by the variations to which we feel that it is <lb/>
            subject, since the most general cause of change is fatigue, and <lb/>
            it would be folly to enter into any long detail about terrestrial <lb/>
            or aquatic animals, dwelling at any length upon their general <lb/>
            or particular changes ; for these animals very naturally are <lb/>
            liable to weakness in a much greater degree than those sub­ <lb/>
            lime objects, inasmuch as they partake to the greatest extent <lb/>
            of the lowest, that is of earthly essence.</p>
          <p>Since therefore it is naturally the case that things, which. <lb/>
            are changed, are changed in consequence of fatigue, and since <lb/>
            God is subject to no variation and to no change, he must also <lb/>
            by nature be free from fatigue, and that, which has no partici­ <lb/>
            pation in weakness, even though it moves everything, cannot <lb/>
            possibly cease to enjoy rest for ever. So that rest is the ap­ <lb/>
            propriate attribute of God alone. <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxiii. 2. </note> <pb n="198"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXVII. And it has been shown that it is suitable to his <lb/>
            character to keep festival; sabbaths therefore and festivals <lb/>
            belong to the great Cause of all things alone, and absolutely to <lb/>
            no man whatever. For come, if you please, and contemplate <lb/>
            with me the much celebrated festive assemblies of men. As <lb/>
            for those which among the barbarian and Grecian nations have <lb/>
            been established in compliance with fabulous fictions, all <lb/>
            tending to no other object than to excite vain pride in various <lb/>
            nations, they may be all passed over, for the entire life of a <lb/>
            man would not be long enough to make an accurate and tho­ <lb/>
            rough investigation of all the absurdities which existed in each <lb/>
            of those festivals. But with a due regard to our time, we will <lb/>
            mention a few points in the most important of them, as a spe­ <lb/>
            cimen of the whole. In every festival then and assembly <lb/>
            among men, the following are the most remarkable and cele­ <lb/>
            brated points, security, relaxation, truce, drunkenness, deep <lb/>
            drinking, revelling, luxury, amusement, music at the doors, ban­ <lb/>
            quets lasting through the night, unseemly pleasures, wedding <lb/>
            feasts during the day, violent acts of insolence, practices of <lb/>
            intemperance, indulgence of folly, pursuits of shameful things, <lb/>
            an utter destruction and renunciation of what is good, wake­ <lb/>
            fulness during the night for the indulgence of immoderate <lb/>
            appetites, sleep by day when it is the proper time to be <lb/>
            awake, a turning upside down of the laws of nature. At <lb/>
            such a time virtue is ridiculed as a mischievous thing, and <lb/>
            vice is caught at as something advantageous.</p>
          <p>Then actions that ought to be done are held in no honour, <lb/>
            and such as ought not be done are esteemed. Then music <lb/>
            and philosophy and all education, the really divine images of <lb/>
            the divine soul, are reduced to silence, and such practices as <lb/>
            are panders and pimps of pleasure to the belly, and the parts <lb/>
            adjacent to the belly, are alone allowed to raise their voice.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Such are the festivals of those who call them­ <lb/>
            selves happy men, and even while they confine their unseemly <lb/>
            conduct within their houses and unconsecrated places, they appear <lb/>
            to me to be less guilty. But when, like the rush of a torrent <lb/>
            carrying everything away with it, their indecency approaches <lb/>
            and insults the most holy temples, it immediately overtaxes <lb/>
            all that there is sacred in them, performing unhallowed sacri­ <lb/>
            fices, offering victims which ought not to be sacrificed, and <lb/>
            prayers such as should never be accomplished; celebrating im­ <lb/>
             <pb n="199"/>
            pious mysteries, and profane rites, displaying a bastard piety, an <lb/>
            adulterated holiness, an impure purity, a falsified truth, a <lb/>
            debauched service of God. And besides all this, they wash <lb/>
            their bodies with baths and purifications, but they neither <lb/>
            desire nor endeavour to wash off the passions of their souls, by <lb/>
            which their whole life is polluted ; and they are eager to <lb/>
            flock to the temples in white garments, clothed in robes with­ <lb/>
            out spot or stain, but they feel no shame at bringing a polluted <lb/>
            mind up to the very inmost shrine. And if any one of the <lb/>
            beasts, to be sacrificed, is found to be not perfect and entire, it is <lb/>
            . driven out of the sacred precincts, and is not allowed to be <lb/>
            brought to the altar, even though all these corporeal imper­ <lb/>
            fections are quite involuntary on its part; but though they may <lb/>
            themselves be wounded in their souls by sensible diseases, which <lb/>
            the invincible power of wickedness has inflicted on them, or <lb/>
            though, I might rather say, they are mutilated and curtailed <lb/>
            of their fairest proportions, of prudence, and courage, and justice, <lb/>
            piety, and of all the other virtues which the human race is <lb/>
            naturally formed to possess, and although too they have con­ <lb/>
            tracted all this pollution and mutilation of their own free will, <lb/>
            they nevertheless dare to perform sacrifices, thinking that the <lb/>
            eye of God sees external objects alone, when the sun co-operates <lb/>
            and throws light upon them, and that it cannot discern what <lb/>
            is invisible in preference to what is visible, using itself as <lb/>
            its own light.</p>
          <p>For the eye of the living God does not need any other light <lb/>
            to enable him to perceive things, but being himself archetypal <lb/>
            light he pours forth innumerable rays, not one of which is <lb/>
            capable of being comprehended by the outward sense, but they <lb/>
            are all only intelligible to the intellect; in consequence of which <lb/>
            God alone uses them who is only comprehensible to the <lb/>
            intellect, and nothing that has any portion in creation uses <lb/>
            them at all; for that which has been created is perceptible to <lb/>
            the outward senses, but that nature which is only perceptible <lb/>
            to the intellect cannot be comprehended by the outward <lb/>
            sense.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Since, therefore, he thus invisibly enters into this <lb/>
            region of the soul, let us prepare that place in the best way <lb/>
            the case admits of, to be an abode worthy of God ; for if we do <lb/>
            not, he, without our being aware of it, will quit us and migrate <lb/>
            to some other habitation, which shall appear to him to be more <lb/>
             <pb n="200"/>
            excellently provided. For if when we are about to receive kings, <lb/>
            we prepare our houses to wear a more magnificent appearance, <lb/>
            neglecting nothing which may give them ornament, but <lb/>
            using every thing in a liberal and unsparing manner, having <lb/>
            for our object that they shall have an abode pleasant to them, <lb/>
            and in all respects suitable to their majesty; what sort of <lb/>
            habitation ought we to prepare for the King of kings, for God <lb/>
            the ruler of the whole universe, condescending in his mercy <lb/>
            and lovingkindness for man to visit the beings whom he has <lb/>
            created, and to come down from the borders of heaven to the <lb/>
            lowest regions of the earth, for the purpose of benefiting our . <lb/>
            race? Shall we prepare him a house of stone or of wooden <lb/>
            materials ? Away! such an idea is not holy even to utter ; for <lb/>
            not even if the whole earth were to change its nature and to <lb/>
            become on a sudden gold, or something more valuable than <lb/>
            gold, and if it were then to be wholly consumed by the skill of <lb/>
            workmen, who should make it into porticoes and vestibules, and <lb/>
            chambers, and precincts, and temples-not even then could <lb/>
            it be a place worthy for his feet to tread upon, but a pious soul <lb/>
            is his fitting abode.</p>
          <p>XXX. If therefore we call the invisible soul the terrestial <lb/>
            habitation of the invisible God, we shall be speaking justly and <lb/>
            according to reason; but that the house may be firm and <lb/>
            beautiful, let a good disposition and knowledge be laid as its <lb/>
            foundations, and on these foundations let the virtues be built <lb/>
            up in union with good actions, and let the ornaments of the <lb/>
            front be the due comprehension of the encyclical branches of <lb/>
            elementary instruction ; for from goodness of disposition arise <lb/>
            skill, perseverance, memory; and from knowledge arise learning <lb/>
            and attention, as the roots of a tree which is about to bring forth <lb/>
            eatable fruit, and without which it is impossible to bring the <lb/>
            intellect to perfection.</p>
          <p>But by the virtues, and by actions in accordance with them, <lb/>
            a firm and strong foundation for a lasting building is secured, <lb/>
            in order that anything which may endeavour to separate and <lb/>
            alienate the soul from honesty and make it such another haunt, <lb/>
            may be powerless against so strong a defence, and by means <lb/>
            of the study of the encyclical branches of elementary edu­ <lb/>
            cation, the things requisite for the ornament of the soul are <lb/>
            provided; for as whitewashing, and paintings, and tablets, <lb/>
            and the arrangement of costly stones, by which men decorate <lb/>
             <pb n="201"/>
            not merely the walls, but even the lower parts of their houses, <lb/>
            and all other such things as these do not contribute to strength, <lb/>
            but only give pleasure to those who live in the house; so the <lb/>
            knowledge of the encyclical accomplishments decorates the <lb/>
            whole habitation of the soul, while grammar investigates the <lb/>
            principles of poetry and follows up the history of ancient <lb/>
            events, and geometry labours at equalities according to <lb/>
            analogy, and endeavours to remedy whatever in us is deficient <lb/>
            in rhythm or in moderation, or in harmony, by giving us <lb/>
            rhythm, and moderation, and harmony, by means of a polished <lb/>
            system of music ; and rhetoric aims at giving us acuteness in <lb/>
            everything, and at properly adapting all proper interpretations <lb/>
            to everything, claiming for itself the control of all in tense­ <lb/>
            ness and all the vehement affections, and again of all relax­ <lb/>
            ations and pleasures, with great freedom of speech, and <lb/>
            a successful application of the organs of language and <lb/>
            voice.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Such a house then being prepared in the race of <lb/>
            mankind, all things on earth will be filled with good hopes, <lb/>
            expecting the return of the powers of God; and they will <lb/>
            come, bringing laws from heaven, and bonds, for the purpose <lb/>
            of sanctifying and hallowing it, according to the command of <lb/>
            their Father ; then becoming the associates and constant com­ <lb/>
            panions of these souls which love virtue, they sow in them the <lb/>
            genus of happiness : as they gave to the wise Abraham his <lb/>
            son Isaac as the most perfect proof of their gratitude for the <lb/>
            hospitality which they experienced from him.</p>
          <p>And the purified intellect rejoices in nothing more than in <lb/>
            confessing that it has for its master him who is the Lord of <lb/>
            all ; for to be the servant of God is the greatest boast, and <lb/>
            is more honourable, not only than freedom, but even than <lb/>
            riches or dominion, or than anything which the race of man­ <lb/>
            kind is eager for. And of the supreme authority'of the living <lb/>
            God, the sacred scripture is a true witness, which speaks thus: <lb/>
            " And the land shall not be sold for ever; for all the earth is <lb/>
            mine, because ye are all strangers and sojourners in my <lb/>
            sight."* Does not the scripture here most manifestly show <lb/>
            that all things belong to God by virtue of possession, but to <lb/>
            created things only inasmuch as they have the use of them ? <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxv. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="202"/>
            For, says God, nothing shall be permanently sold to any one <lb/>
            of all created beings, since there is one being to whom the pos­ <lb/>
            session of the universe does permanently and surely belong; <lb/>
            for God has given the use of all created things to all men, not <lb/>
            having made any one of those things which are only in part <lb/>
            perfect, so as to have absolutely no need of anything else, in <lb/>
            order that, being desirous to obtain that of which it has need, <lb/>
            it may of necessity unite itself to that which is able to supply <lb/>
            it, and that other may in its turn unite with it, and both may <lb/>
            thus combine with one another; for thus, the two combining <lb/>
            and mingling together, and like a lyre which is composed of <lb/>
            dissimilar sounds, coming into one combination and symphony, <lb/>
            must of necessity sound together, while all things giving and <lb/>
            receiving in turn contribute to the completion and perfection <lb/>
            of the universal world.</p>
          <p>In this way inanimate things combine with those which have <lb/>
            life, irrational things with those endowed with reason, trees <lb/>
            with men, and men with plants, things untameable with those <lb/>
            which are tame, and domestic animals with savage ones, the <lb/>
            male with the female, and the female with the male; in short, <lb/>
            terrestrial animals with such as live in the water, aquatic <lb/>
            creatures with those whose home is in the air, and flying <lb/>
            animals with any of these described above. And besides all <lb/>
            those things, earth with heaven, and heaven with earth, air <lb/>
            with water, and water with air..And again the intermediate <lb/>
            natures with one another, and with these at their extremities, <lb/>
            and the extremities too form an attachment to the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate natures and to one another. So again winter feels a <lb/>
            need of summer, and summer of winter, spring of both, and <lb/>
            autumn of spring, and each of these seasons of each other <lb/>
            season; and, so to say, everything has a need and want of <lb/>
            everything else. So that the whole universe of which all these <lb/>
            are parts, namely the world, is clearly a complete work, worthy <lb/>
            of its Maker.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Thus, therefore, putting all these things together, <lb/>
            God appropriated the dominion over them all to himself, but <lb/>
            the use and enjoyment of themselves and of each other he <lb/>
            allowed to those who are subject to him; for we have the <lb/>
            complete use of our own faculties and of everything which affects <lb/>
            us: I therefore, consisting of soul and body, and appearing to <lb/>
            have a mind, and reason, and outward sense, find that not one <lb/>
             <pb n="203"/>
            of all these things is my own property. For where was my <lb/>
            body before my birth ? and' where will it go when I am de­ <lb/>
            parted ? And what becomes of the differences of age of that <lb/>
            being which at present appears to exist ? Where is now the <lb/>
            infant ?-where the child?—where the boy ?-where the youth <lb/>
            just arriving at the age of puberty ?-where the young man?— <lb/>
            where is he now whose beard is just budding, the vigorous <lb/>
            and perfect man ? Whence came the soul, and whither will it <lb/>
            go ? and how long will it remain with us ? and what is its <lb/>
            essence, or what may we speak of as such ? Moreover, when <lb/>
            did we acquire it? Was it before our birth ?-But then we <lb/>
            ourselves did not exist. Shall we have it after our death ?—. <lb/>
            But then we shall not exist, we who are now a combination <lb/>
            of distinctive qualities in combination with our bodies; but <lb/>
            rather we shall then be hastening to a regeneration, becoming <lb/>
            in combination with incorporeal beings: and now, when we <lb/>
            are alive we are governed rather than governing, and we are <lb/>
            understood ourselves rather than understanding anything else ; <lb/>
            for our soul understands us without being understood by us, <lb/>
            and it imposes commands upon us which we are necessitated <lb/>
            to obey, as servants are compelled to obey a mistress ; and <lb/>
            whenever it chooses to abandon us and to depart to the Ruler <lb/>
            of all things, it will depart, leaving our house destitute of life. <lb/>
            And even if we attempt to compel it to remain, it will disap­ <lb/>
            pear ; for its nature is composed of unsubstantial parts, such <lb/>
            as afford no handle to the body.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But the mind is my peculiar place of abode. Is <lb/>
            this the language of the mistaken conjecturer, of the former <lb/>
            of erroneous opinions, of the man out of his mind, of the fool, <lb/>
            of him who is found to be destitute of his senses through a <lb/>
            trance, or through melancholy, or from old age ? Will any <lb/>
            one then say, reason is my possession, or the organs of voice <lb/>
            are my possession ? Has not a very slight pretext of disease <lb/>
            disabled the voice ? has it not sewn up the mouths of even <lb/>
            very eloquent men ? Has not an expectation of danger, when <lb/>
            it has come upon men, rendered myriads speechless ?</p>
          <p>And in truth I am not found to be the governor of the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses, or perhaps I may even turn out to be their slave, <lb/>
            following where they lead me, to colours, to shapes, to sounds <lb/>
            to smells, to flavours, or to other kinds of substances. By all <lb/>
            which I think it is shown that we have the use of possessions <lb/>
            which in reality belong to others, and that neither glory, nor <lb/>
             <pb n="204"/>
            riches, nor honours, nor authority, nor anything else which <lb/>
            concerns our bodies or souls is really our own, nor indeed even <lb/>
            life itself.</p>
          <p>But having the use of these things, if we are judicious and <lb/>
            prudent, we shall take care of them as possessions of God, being <lb/>
            well aware beforehand that it is the law, that the master, <lb/>
            whenever he pleases, may reclaim his own property. For by <lb/>
            these considerations we shall diminish our grief for the depri­ <lb/>
            vation of such things. But now, men in general, thinking <lb/>
            that every thing is really their own property, are in a moment <lb/>
            afflicted with extraordinary grief at the absence or loss of <lb/>
            any thing. It is, therefore, not only true, but a thing also <lb/>
            which most especially tends to consolation, to consider that the <lb/>
            world and all the things in the world are the works and the <lb/>
            property of him who created them. And his own work, he <lb/>
            who is its real possessor, gives to others, because he has no <lb/>
            need of it himself. But he who uses it has no property in it, <lb/>
            because there is one Lord and master of all things, who says <lb/>
            most truly, "All the earth is mine," a saying which is equiva­ <lb/>
            lent to-every created thing is mine; and " ye are all strangers <lb/>
            and sojourners in my sight."</p>
          <p>XXXIV. For all mortals, being compared with one another, <lb/>
            are looked upon as natives of the soil, and nobly born persons, <lb/>
            all enjoying equal honours, and equal rank; but by God they <lb/>
            are looked upon as strangers and sojourners; for each of us <lb/>
            has come into this world as to a new city, in which he had no <lb/>
            share before his birth, and having come into it he dwells here, <lb/>
            until he has completed the period of life allotted to him. At <lb/>
            the same time, also, this doctrine of exceeding wisdom is intro­ <lb/>
            duced, that the Lord God is the only real citizen, and that <lb/>
            every created being is but a stranger and a sojourner. But <lb/>
            those who are called citizens are called ro rather in conse­ <lb/>
            quence of a slight misapplication of the name than in strict <lb/>
            truth. And it is a sufficient gift to wise men—if considered <lb/>
            comparatively with the only true citizen, God—for them to <lb/>
            have the rank of strangers and sojourners. With respect to <lb/>
            foolish men, of them there is absolutely no one who is a <lb/>
            stranger or sojourner in the city of God, but such an one is <lb/>
            found to be utterly an exile. And this is implied in what he <lb/>
            said besides as a most authoritative doctrine, " The land shall <lb/>
            not be utterly sold away." Nor did God add " by whom," in <lb/>
            order that from that point being passed over in silence, he <lb/>
             <pb n="205"/>
            who was not wholly uninitiated in natural philosophy, might <lb/>
            be benefited in respect of knowledge.</p>
          <p>Therefore, if you consider the matter, you will find that all <lb/>
            men, and especially those who have been alluded to as giving <lb/>
            gratuitously, sell rather than give ; and that they, who we fancy <lb/>
            are receiving favours, are, in reality, purchasing the benefits <lb/>
            which they derive ; for they who give, hoping to receive a re­ <lb/>
            quital, such as praise or honour, and seeking for a return of <lb/>
            the favour which they are conferring, under the specious name <lb/>
            of a gift, are, in reality, making a bargain. Since it is usual, <lb/>
            for those who sell, to receive a price in return for what they <lb/>
            part with; but they who, receiving presents, feel anxiety to <lb/>
            make a return for them, and make such a return in due sea­ <lb/>
            son, they in reality perform the part of purchasers; for as <lb/>
            they know how to receive, so also do they know how to re­ <lb/>
            quite. But God distributes his good things, not like a seller <lb/>
            vending his wares at a high price, but he is inclined to make <lb/>
            presents of everything, pouring forth the inexhaustible foun­ <lb/>
            tains of his graces, and never desiring any return; for he has <lb/>
            no need of anything, nor is there any created being competent <lb/>
            to give him a suitable gift in return.</p>
          <p>XXXV. As all things then are confessed to be the pos­ <lb/>
            sessions of God, and proved to be so by sound reasonings and <lb/>
            testimonies, which cannot possibly be convicted of bearing <lb/>
            false witness, for they are the sacred oracles which Moses has <lb/>
            recorded in the Holy Scriptures that bear witness; we must <lb/>
            deprecate that mind which fancied that that which originated <lb/>
            in a meeting with the outward sense was his own property, <lb/>
            and which called it Cain, and said, " I have gotten a man by <lb/>
            means of God," in this also greatly erring. But in what did <lb/>
            he err? Because God was the cause, not the instrument; <lb/>
            and what was born was created indeed through the agency of <lb/>
            some instrument, but was by all means called into existence <lb/>
            by the great first cause; for many things must co-operate in <lb/>
            the origination of anything; by whom, from what, by means <lb/>
            of what, and why? Now he by whom a thing originates is the <lb/>
            cause ; that from which a thing is made is the material; that <lb/>
            by means of which it was made is the instrument; and why, <lb/>
            is the object.</p>
          <p>For come now, suppose any one should say, what things <lb/>
            must meet together, that any house or city may be made ? <lb/>
             <pb n="206"/>
            Must there not be a builder, and stones, and timber, and <lb/>
            tools ? What then is the builder, but the cause by whom the <lb/>
            house or city is built? And what are the stones and timber, <lb/>
            but the materials of which the building is made ? And what <lb/>
            are the tools, but the things by means of which it is made ? <lb/>
            And for what reason is it built, except to serve as a shelter <lb/>
            and protection ? This is the object. Now passing on from <lb/>
            these particular buildings, consider the greatest house or city, <lb/>
            namely, this world, for you will find that God is the cause of <lb/>
            it, by whom it was made. That the materials are the four <lb/>
            elements, of which it is composed ; that the instrument is the <lb/>
            word of God, by means of which it was made; and the object <lb/>
            of the building you will find to be the display of the goodness <lb/>
            of the Creator.</p>
          <p>This is the discriminating opinion of men fond of truth, <lb/>
            who desire to attain to true and sound knowledge; but they <lb/>
            who say that they have gotten anything by means of God, <lb/>
            conceive that the cause is the instrument, the Creator namely, <lb/>
            and the instrument the cause, namely, the human mind. And <lb/>
            all sound reason would reproach Joseph for saying, " That the <lb/>
            true interpretation of the dreams would be found out by means <lb/>
            of God for he should have said, that owing to him, as the <lb/>
            cause indeed, would be the unfolding and accurate under­ <lb/>
            standing of those things which were obscure ; for we are the <lb/>
            instruments by whom the particular energies are developed, <lb/>
            both in our states of tension and of relaxation; but the Cre­ <lb/>
            ator is "he who gives the blow which sets in motion" the <lb/>
            faculties of body and soul, by whom all things are moved.</p>
          <p>Those then who are unable to distinguish between the <lb/>
            differences of things must be instructed as ignorant; but <lb/>
            those who, from a contentious spirit, invert the orders of the <lb/>
            things signified, must be avoided as disputatious; but those <lb/>
            who, after an accurate investigation into the phænomena <lb/>
            which present themselves to them, assign its proper place to <lb/>
            each of the objects discovered, must be praised as men who <lb/>
            have attained to a true philosophy, and are void of error. For <lb/>
            Moses says to those who fear lest they should be destroyed by <lb/>
            the wicked man, who is pursuing them with all his host, <lb/>
            " Stand still, and see the salvation which is from the Lord, <lb/>
            and which he will work for you ;"‡ teaching them that salva­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis x.L 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xiv. 13. </note> <lb/>

            tion is effected, not by means, of God, but by him as the direct <lb/>
            cause.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE SACRIFICES OF ABEL AND CAIN.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. "AND he also added, that she should bring forth his <lb/>
            brother." * The addition of one thing is a taking away of some <lb/>
            other; as for instance, of particles in arithmetic, and of <lb/>
            reasons in the soul. If then we must say that Abel is added, <lb/>
            we must also think that Cain is taken away. But that the <lb/>
            unusual character of expression may not cause perplexity to <lb/>
            many we will endeavour to explain accurately the philosophy <lb/>
            which is apparent beneath them, as clearly as may be in our <lb/>
            power.</p>
          <p>It happens then, that there are two opinions contrary to and <lb/>
            at variance with one another; the one of which commits every­ <lb/>
            thing to the mind as the leader of all reasoning, or feeling, or <lb/>
            moving, or being stationary; and the other, attributing to God <lb/>
            all the consequent work of creation as his own. Now the <lb/>
            symbol of the former of these is Cain, which name, being <lb/>
            interpreted means, " possession," from his appearing to possess <lb/>
            all things ; and the symbol of the other is Abel; for this name, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means " referring to God." Now both <lb/>
            these opinions were brought forth by one soul. But it follows <lb/>
            of necessity that as soon as they were born they must have <lb/>
            been separated; for it was impossible for enemies to dwell <lb/>
            together for ever. Until then the soul brought forth the God- <lb/>
            loving doctrine Abel, the self-loving Cain dwelt with her. But <lb/>
            when she brought forth Abel, or unanimity with God, she <lb/>
            abandoned unanimity with that mind which was wise in its <lb/>
            own conceit.</p>
          <p>II. And this will be more evidently shown by the oracle <lb/>
            which was given to Perseverance, that is to Rebecca ;f for she <lb/>
            also, having conceived the two inconsistent natures of good <lb/>
            and evil, and having considered each of them very deeply <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xxv. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="208"/>
            according to the injunctions of prudence, beholding them both <lb/>
            exulting, and making a sort of skirmish as a prelude to the <lb/>
            war which was to exist between them ; she, I say, besought God <lb/>
            to explain to her what this calamity meant, and what was the <lb/>
            remedy for it. And he answered her inquiry, and told her, <lb/>
            " Two nations are in thy womb." This calamity is the birth <lb/>
            of good and evil. " But two peoples shall be divided in thy <lb/>
            bowels." And the remedy is, for these two to be parted and <lb/>
            separated from one another, and no longer to abide in the <lb/>
            same place.</p>
          <p>God therefore having added the good doctrine, that is Abel, <lb/>
            to the soul, took away from it evil doctrine, that is Cain : for <lb/>
            Abraham also, leaving mortal things, " is added to the people <lb/>
            of God,"* having received immortality, and having become <lb/>
            equal to the angels; for the angels are the host of God, being <lb/>
            incorporeal and happy souls. And in the same manner Jacob, <lb/>
            the practiser of virtue, is added to the better one,t because he <lb/>
            had quitted the worse. And Isaac, who was thought worthy <lb/>
            of self-taught knowledge, of his own accord also leaves all the <lb/>
            corporeal essence which was attached to his soul, and is added <lb/>
            to and made an inheritor with (not the people, as the others <lb/>
            whom I have mentioned were), but with the "race,"‡ as <lb/>
            Moses says; for "race" is one, and the highest of all: but <lb/>
            " people," is the name of many. As many, therefore, as <lb/>
            through instruction and learning have improved and at last <lb/>
            arrived at perfection, are classed among the larger number. <lb/>
            Nor is number insignificant of those who have learnt from <lb/>
            oral instruction and demonstration, and whom Moses calls the <lb/>
            people. But those men who have forsaken human instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, and having become well-disposed disciples of God, and <lb/>
            having arrived at a comprehension of knowledge acquired with­ <lb/>
            out labour, have passed over to the immortal and most perfect <lb/>
            race of beings, and have so received an inheritance better than <lb/>
            the former generations of created men; and of these men <lb/>
            Isaac is reckoned as a companion.</p>
          <p>III. There is also another proof that the mind is immortal, <lb/>
            which is of this nature :-There are some persons whom God, <lb/>
            advancing to higher degrees of improvement, has enabled to <lb/>
            soar above all species and genera, having placed them near <lb/>
            himself; as he says to Moses, "But stand thou here with <note type="footnote"> it- Genesis xxv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xliz. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> +Genesis xxxv. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="209"/>
            me."* When, therefore, Moses is about to die, he is not <lb/>
            added to one class, nor does he forsake another, as the men <lb/>
            before him had done; nor is he connected with "addition" <lb/>
            or " subtraction," but " by means of the word of the Cause of <lb/>
            all things, by whom the whole world was made."t He departs <lb/>
            to another abode, that you may understand from this that God <lb/>
            accounts a wise man as entitled to equal honour with the <lb/>
            world itself, having both created the universe, and raised the <lb/>
            perfect man from the things of earth up to himself by the <lb/>
            same word.</p>
          <p>Not but what, when he gave him the use of all earthly <lb/>
            things and suffered him to dwell among them, lie assigned to <lb/>
            him not such a power as he might exercise in common with an <lb/>
            earthly governor or monarch, by which he should forcibly rule <lb/>
            over the passions of the soul, but he appointed him to be a sort <lb/>
            of god, making the whole of the body, and the mind, which is <lb/>
            the ruler of the body, subjects and slaves to him ; " For I give <lb/>
            thee," says he, " as a god to Pharaoh." ‡ But God is not sus­ <lb/>
            ceptible of any subtraction or addition, inasmuch as he is com­ <lb/>
            plete and entirely equal to himself. In reference to which it is <lb/>
            said of Moses, " That no one is said to know of his tomb ;"§ <lb/>
            for who could be competent to perceive the migration of a per­ <lb/>
            fect soul to the living God ? Nor do I even believe that the <lb/>
            soul itself while awaiting this event was conscious of its own <lb/>
            improvement, inasmuch as it was at that time becoming gradu­ <lb/>
            ally divine ; for God, in the case of those persons whom he is <lb/>
            about to benefit, does not take him who is to receive the advan­ <lb/>
            tage into his counsels, but is accustomed rather to pour his <lb/>
            benefits ungrudgingly upon him without his having any previous <lb/>
            anticipation of them.</p>
          <p>This is something like the meaning of God's adding the <lb/>
            creation of what is good to the perfect mind. But the good is <lb/>
            holiness, the name of which is Abel.</p>
          <p>IV. " And Abel became a shepherd of sheep; but Cain <lb/>
            was a tiller of the ground." Why now has Moses, who repre­ <lb/>
            sents Cain as older than Abel, now transposed them in the <lb/>
            order in which he here mentions them, so as to name the younger <lb/>
            first when relating their choice of a way of life ? For it was <lb/>
            natural that the elder should lead the way and adopt the culti­ <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy v. 31. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus vii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Deuteronomy xxxiv. 5. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy xxxiv. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> p </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="210"/>
            vation of the land, and that the younger should subsequently <lb/>
            come to the care of sheep. But Moses is not influenced <lb/>
            by what is likely and probable, but pursues the plain unadul­ <lb/>
            terated truth. And when he alone comes to God by himself, <lb/>
            he tells him with all freedom that "he is not eloquent," which <lb/>
            statement is equivalent to saying that he does not aim at spe­ <lb/>
            cious and plausible reasonings, and that this has happened to <lb/>
            him " not yesterday, or the day before yesterday, but ever since <lb/>
            God began to converse with him as his servant."* For they <lb/>
            who have come into the billows and heavy waves of life must <lb/>
            be borne on by swimming, not being able to take hold of any <lb/>
            firm point of the matters which lie within the province of <lb/>
            knowledge, but depending on what is only likely and probable. <lb/>
            But it becomes a servant of God to lay hold of the truth, dis­ <lb/>
            regarding and rejecting all the uncertain and fabulous state­ <lb/>
            ments which rest on the conjectures of plausible men.</p>
          <p>What, then, is the truth in these matters which we are con­ <lb/>
            sidering ? Why, that wickedness is older than virtue in point <lb/>
            of time, but younger in power and rank. Therefore, when the <lb/>
            birth of the two is narrated, let Cain have the precedence ; but <lb/>
            when a comparison of their pursuits is instituted, then let Abel <lb/>
            be the first; for it happens to the being that is born, from his <lb/>
            very swaddling clothes till the time when the innovating <lb/>
            vigour of his ripe age extinguishes the fiery heat of his passions, <lb/>
            to have for his foster brethren, folly, intemperance, injustice, <lb/>
            fear, cowardice, and the other evil things which are born with <lb/>
            him, every one of which his nurses and tutors foster and cause <lb/>
            to grow up within him ; by their habits and practices banish­ <lb/>
            ing piety, and by their uniform instructions introducing super­ <lb/>
            stition, which is a thing nearly akin to impiety. But when <lb/>
            the child has now passed the age of youth, and when the im­ <lb/>
            petuous disease of the passions has become mollified, as if a <lb/>
            calm had come over them, then the man begins to enjoy tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, having been at length and not without difficulty <lb/>
            strengthened in the foundation of virtue, which has allayed <lb/>
            that continued and incessant agitation which is the greatest <lb/>
            evil of the soul.</p>
          <p>Thus wickedness has the superiority in point of time ; but <lb/>
            virtue in point of rank, and honour and real glory. And this <lb/>
            same law-giver is a trustworthy evidence of this fact; for <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="211"/>
            having introduced Esau, who bears the name of folly, as the <lb/>
            elder in point of time, he gives the birthright and chief honour <lb/>
            to the younger, who, from his practice of virtue, was called <lb/>
            Jacob. And he is not seen to obtain this pre-eminence before <lb/>
            (as is the case in athletic contests) his adversary renounces the <lb/>
            combat, putting down his hands from weakness, and yielding <lb/>
            up the decision and the crown to him who has carried on a <lb/>
            truceless and irreconcileable war against the passions; for, <lb/>
            says Moses, " He sold his birthright to Jacob,"* avowing, in <lb/>
            plain terms that the pre-eminence in power and the honours of <lb/>
            virtue belong to no wicked man, but only to him who is a lover <lb/>
            of wisdom, just as the flute and the lyre and the other instru­ <lb/>
            ments of music belong to the musician alone.</p>
          <p>V. And concerning this doctrine Moses also records a law, <lb/>
            which he makes with great beauty and suitableness. And it <lb/>
            runs thus, " If a man have two wives, the one of them <lb/>
            beloved and the other hated; and if both the one who is <lb/>
            beloved and the one who is hated have borne him children, and <lb/>
            if the child of her who is hated is the first-born, then it shall <lb/>
            be in the day in which he divides the inheritance of his <lb/>
            possessions among his sons that he shall not be able to give <lb/>
            the inheritance of the first-born to the son of the wife that is <lb/>
            beloved, overlooking his first-born son, the son of her who is <lb/>
            hated; but he shall recognise the soil of her who is hated as <lb/>
            his first-born, to give him a double share of all the property <lb/>
            that he has acquired ; because he is the beginning of his chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and the right of the first-born is his."t</p>
          <p>Consider, 0 my soul, and know who it is who is hated, and <lb/>
            who is the son of her who is hated, and immediately you shall <lb/>
            perceive that the chief rights and chief honours belong to no <lb/>
            one else but to him alone; for there are two wives cohabiting <lb/>
            with each individual of us, hostile and inimical to one another, <lb/>
            filling the abode of the soul with the contentions which arise <lb/>
            from jealousy. Of these we love one, which is gentle and <lb/>
            tractable, and which we think very affectionate and akin to <lb/>
            ourselves, and its name is pleasure ; but the other we hate, <lb/>
            looking upon it as untameable, ungentle, fierce, and very hostile <lb/>
            to us, and the name of this one is virtue. Now what mortal is <lb/>
            ignorant of the great mysteries of that exceedingly beautiful <lb/>
            and greatly contended for pleasure ? And who could worthily <note type="footnote"> Genesis xxv. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="212"/>
            describe the multitude or the greatness of the good things <lb/>
            which are treasured up by virtue ? They who have partaken <lb/>
            of them already know it, and those whose nature is mild will <lb/>
            hereafter know, when they have been invited to a participation <lb/>
            in the banquet, not the banquet at which the pleasures of the <lb/>
            satiated belly make the body fat, but that at which the mind is <lb/>
            nourished and at which it revels among the virtues, and exults <lb/>
            and revels in their company.</p>
          <p>VI. Now, on account of these things, and because of what <lb/>
            was said before, namely, that the things which are really pious, <lb/>
            holy, and good do naturally utter a voice from themselves, even <lb/>
            while they keep silence, I will desist from saying any more <lb/>
            about them; for neither does the sun nor the moon require an <lb/>
            interpreter, because they, being on high, fill the whole world <lb/>
            with light, the one shining by day and the other by night. <lb/>
            But their own brilliancy is an evidence in their case which <lb/>
            stands in no need of witnesses, but which is confirmed by the <lb/>
            eyes, which are more undeniable judges than the ears. But I <lb/>
            will speak with all freedom of that point in virtue which appears <lb/>
            to have the greatest amount of difficulty and perplexity, for <lb/>
            this, too, does appear to the imagination, at their first meeting, <lb/>
            to be troublesome ; but, on consideration, it is found to be very <lb/>
            pleasant and, as arising from reason, to be suitable. But <lb/>
            labour is the enemy of laziness, as it is in reality the first and <lb/>
            greatest of good things, and wages an irreconcileable war <lb/>
            against pleasure; for, if we must declare the truth, God has <lb/>
            made labour the foundation of all good and of all virtue to <lb/>
            man, and without labour you will not find a single good thing <lb/>
            in existence among the race of men. For, as it is impossible to <lb/>
            see without light, since neither colours nor eyes are sufficient <lb/>
            for the comprehension of things which we arrive at by means <lb/>
            of sight (for nature has made light beforehand to serve as a <lb/>
            link to connect the two, by which the eye is brought near and <lb/>
            adapted to colour, for the powers of both eye and of colour are <lb/>
            equally useless in darkness), so in the same manner is the eye <lb/>
            of the soul unable to comprehend anything whatever of the <lb/>
            actions in accordance with virtue, unless it takes to itself <lb/>
            labour as a coadjutor, as the eye borrows the assistance of light; <lb/>
            for this, being placed in the middle, between the intellect and <lb/>
            the good object which the intellect desires, and understanding <lb/>
            the whole nature of both the one and the other, does itself <lb/>
             <pb n="213"/>
            bring about friendship and harmony, two perfect goods between <lb/>
            the two things on either hand of it.</p>
          <p>VII. For, choose whatever good thing you please, and you <lb/>
            will find that it owes its existence and all its strength and <lb/>
            solidity to labour. Now, piety and holiness are good things, <lb/>
            but still we are not able to attain to them without the worship <lb/>
            of the gods, and the worship of them is combined with persever­ <lb/>
            alice in labours. Again, prudence and courage and justice are <lb/>
            all beautiful things and perfect goods, but still they are not to <lb/>
            be acquired by laziness, and we must be content if they can be <lb/>
            attained to by continued diligence.</p>
          <p>Now, since the organs of every soul are not able to support <lb/>
            a familiarity with God and with virtue, as being a very intense <lb/>
            and mighty harmony, they very often get lax and become re­ <lb/>
            miss so as to descend from the highest unto those of more <lb/>
            moderate character ; but, nevertheless, even in these moderate <lb/>
            ones there is great labour requisite. Look at all those who <lb/>
            practise the encyclical branches of what is called elementary <lb/>
            instruction ; look at those who cultivate the land, and at all <lb/>
            who provide the means of subsistence by any regular business. <lb/>
            These men are never free from care night or day, but always <lb/>
            and continually, as it is said, they labour with hand and foot <lb/>
            and with all their power, and never cease from suffering hard­ <lb/>
            ship, so as often to encounter even death from it.</p>
          <p>VIlI. But as those who are thus anxious to render their <lb/>
            souls propitious must of necessity cultivate the virtues of the <lb/>
            soul, so also they who purpose to render their bodies favour­ <lb/>
            able to their objects, must cultivate health and those powers <lb/>
            which are akin to health, and these too they cultivate with un­ <lb/>
            remitting and ceaseless labours, being overwhelmed with care, <lb/>
            arising from the faculties in them of which they are com­ <lb/>
            pounded.</p>
          <p>You see, therefore, that all good things spring up and shoot <lb/>
            out from labour as from one general root, and this you must <lb/>
            never allow yourself to neglect; for if you do, you will without <lb/>
            being aware of it, be also letting slip the collected heap of <lb/>
            goods which it brings with it; for the Ruler of the universe, <lb/>
            of heaven, and of the world, both himself possesses and <lb/>
            bestows on whomsoever he pleases, his good things, with all <lb/>
            ease and abundance. Since formerly he created this world, <lb/>
            vast as you see it is, without any labour, and how too he never <lb/>
             <pb n="214"/>
            ceases holding it together, so that it may last for ever. And <lb/>
            absence from all labour and fatigue is the most appropriate <lb/>
            attribute of God ; but nature has not given the acquisition 'of <lb/>
            good things to any mortal without labour,* in order that in <lb/>
            consequence of this arrangement, God alone of existing beings <lb/>
            may be called happy and enjoy felicity.</p>
          <p>IX. For labour appears to me to have nearly the same pro­ <lb/>
            perties as food. As therefore this latter makes life to depend <lb/>
            upon itself, having combined all the actions and all the <lb/>
            passions in living, so also has labour caused all good things to <lb/>
            depend upon itself. For as those persons who are desirous to <lb/>
            live must not neglect food, so too they who are anxious to <lb/>
            attain to good things must pay due attention to labour, for <lb/>
            what food is to life that labour is to virtue. Do not you then <lb/>
            ever slight that, though it is but a single thing, that by its <lb/>
            means you may enjoy the collective blessings of all good <lb/>
            things. For thus, though you may be younger by birth you <lb/>
            shall be called the elder, and you shall be thought worthy of <lb/>
            the pre-eminence in honour. But if, having gone through a <lb/>
            constant course of improvement you shall at last arrive at the <lb/>
            end, then not only shall the Father give thee the pre-emi­ <lb/>
            nence, but he shall also bestow on thee all the inheritance of <lb/>
            the Father, as he did to Jacob, who overthrew all the founda­ <lb/>
            tions and seats of passion, and who confessed what he suffered, <lb/>
            saying that " God has pitied me, and all things belong to <lb/>
            me,”† uttering a doctrine full of instruction, for he makes <lb/>
            everything to anchor in the mercy of God.</p>
          <p>X. And he learnt all these things from Abraham his grand­ <lb/>
            father, who was the author of his own education, who gave to <lb/>
            the all-wise Isaac all that he had,‡ leaving none of his sub­ <lb/>
            stance to bastards, or to the spurious reasonings of concubines, <lb/>
            but he gives them small gifts, as being inconsiderable persons. <lb/>
            For the possessions of which he is possessed, namely, the per­ <lb/>
            fect virtues, belong only to the perfect and legitimate son ; but <lb/>
            those which are of an intermediate character, are suitable to <lb/>
            and fall to the share of those who are not perfect, but who <note type="footnote"> * This is not only the same idea, but almost the very language of <lb/>
            Horace: <lb/>
            Nil sine magno <lb/>
            Vita labore dedit mortalibus.—Sat. I. ix. 60. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Genesis xxxiii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxv. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="215"/>
            have advanced as far as the encyclical branches of elementary <lb/>
            education, of which Agar and Cheturah partake, Agar mean­ <lb/>
            ing " a dwelling near," and Cheturah meaning “sacrificing.”</p>
          <p>For he who attends only to the encyclical instruction abides <lb/>
            near wisdom but does not dwell with it, as sending a certain <lb/>
            sweet fragrance from the elegance of contemplation to his own <lb/>
            soul. But such a man requires food, and not sweet scents to <lb/>
            bless him with good health. But nature is said to have made, <lb/>
            with great skill and propriety, smell to serve as a handmaid <lb/>
            to taste, as a sort of subject and taster to the other, or her <lb/>
            queen; and we must always attend to the sovereign powers <lb/>
            before those who are ruled over by them, and to the indi­ <lb/>
            genous and native sciences before those which are strangers. <lb/>
            The mind bearing this rejects pleasure, and attaches itself to <lb/>
            virtue, perceiving its genuine, and unalloyed, and very divine <lb/>
            beauty. Then it becomes the shepherd of sheep, being the <lb/>
            charioteer and pilot of the irrational faculties which exist in <lb/>
            the soul, " not permitting them to be borne about at random <lb/>
            and in an inconsistent manner, without any superintendant or <lb/>
            guide ;* that they may not fall into a sort of orphan state, <lb/>
            destitute of guardians and protectors, owing to their want of <lb/>
            any allies, in which case they would perish without any saving <lb/>
            hand to restrain them.</p>
          <p>XI. Accordingly, Jacob, the practiser of contemplation, con­ <lb/>
            ceiving this to be an employment most closely akin to virtue, <lb/>
            endured " to be the shepherd of the flocks of Laban,"t a mail <lb/>
            wholly devoted to colours and to forms, and, in short, to life­ <lb/>
            less substances ; and he tended not all of them. but the residue <lb/>
            only. Now, what is the interpretation of this?</p>
          <p>The irrational animal is of a twofold character; one consist­ <lb/>
            ing in a misuse of that reason which should direct the choice, <lb/>
            and such we call people out of their mind : the other consisting <lb/>
            in an absolute privation of reason, which we see to exist in <lb/>
            these animals which we call brutes. Now, the irrational <lb/>
            impulses of the mind, I mean those faculties which are deve­ <lb/>
            loped in a misuse of that reason which should direct the choice, <lb/>
            the sons of Laban, " when they had departed three days' jour­ <lb/>
            ney,”‡ paid great regard to; being thus under a symbol cut <lb/>
            off from virtue for the whole period of their life ; for time is <lb/>
            capable of being divided into three parts, consisting of the <note type="footnote"> ' Numbers xxvii. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxx. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Ibid. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="216"/>
            past, and the present, and the future. But these animals <lb/>
            which are irrational in the second sense, and which are desti­ <lb/>
            tute not only of right reason but of all reason whatever, under <lb/>
            which class the brute beasts are reckoned, the practiser of con­ <lb/>
            templation will think worthy of all his care, considering that <lb/>
            their errors have proceeded, not so much from deliberate wick­ <lb/>
            edness as from ignorance, which was devoid of a guide.</p>
          <p>Ignorance, therefore, being but a slight and also an invo­ <lb/>
            luntary calamity, admits of a cure which is neither difficult <lb/>
            nor troublesome, namely instruction. But, wickedness being <lb/>
            a voluntary disease of the soul, admits of no remedy but such <lb/>
            as is difficult, and almost impossible. Therefore his sons, as <lb/>
            men who have been instructed by a father of exceeding wis­ <lb/>
            dom, even if they do go down to Egypt, that is to say, to the <lb/>
            body which is inclined to be a slave to the passions, and even <lb/>
            if they meet with Pharaoh, that squanderer of all good things, <lb/>
            who appears to be the sovereign of the composite animals, <lb/>
            being not at all bewildered with the abundance of the prepara­ <lb/>
            tions which they behold, confess that they are shepherds of <lb/>
            sheep, and not only they but their fathers also.*</p>
          <p>XII. And yet no one would ever utter so great a boast in <lb/>
            consequence of any power and sovereignty as these men do in <lb/>
            respect of their being shepherds; to those indeed who are <lb/>
            able to reason correctly, it is a more noble employment than <lb/>
            that of a king, to be able to govern the body and the outward <lb/>
            senses, and the belly, as one might govern a city or a country, <lb/>
            and to restrain the pleasures which have their seat around the <lb/>
            belly, and the other passions, and one's tongue, and, in short, <lb/>
            all the different parts of one's composite nature, with vigour <lb/>
            and exceeding power, and again to guide them in the right <lb/>
            way with due gentleness; for it is necessary at one time to act <lb/>
            like a charioteer who slackens the reins with which he holds <lb/>
            the horses which are yoked to his chariot, and at other times <lb/>
            one must draw them tight, and resist the haste of the steeds, <lb/>
            that no precipitation and impetuous pursuit of outward objects <lb/>
            may take place, and lead them into rebellion. And I admire <lb/>
            that guardian of the laws, Moses, who, thinking it a great and <lb/>
            noble task to be a shepherd, has attributed that employment <lb/>
            to himself; for he manages and conducts the doctrines of <lb/>
            Jethro, leading them from the tumultuous vexations of political <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlvii 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="217"/>
            affairs into the desert, for the purpose of avoiding all tempta­ <lb/>
            tion to injustice.</p>
          <p>" For he led the sheep into the wilderness."* The conse­ <lb/>
            quence of which conduct of his was that " Every shepherd of <lb/>
            sheep is an abomination to the Egyptians.”† For every man <lb/>
            who loves his passions hates right reason as the governor and <lb/>
            guide to good things; just as foolish children hate their tutors <lb/>
            and teachers, and every one who reproves them or corrects <lb/>
            them, or would lead them to virtue. But Moses says that he <lb/>
            “ will sacrifice the abominations of the Egyptians to God,”‡ <lb/>
            namely the virtues which are faultless and most becoming vic­ <lb/>
            tims, which every foolish man abominates. So that very <lb/>
            appropriately, Abel, who brought the best offerings to God, is <lb/>
            called a shepherd ; but he, who offered every thing to himself <lb/>
            and to his own mind, is called a tiller of the earth, namely <lb/>
            Cain. And what is meant by tilling the earth § we have shown <lb/>
            in our previous treatises.</p>
          <p>XIII. And it came to pass after some days that Cain <lb/>
            brought of the fruits of the earth as an offering to the Lord. <lb/>
            Here are two accusations against the self-loving man; one <lb/>
            that he showed his gratitude to God after some days, and not <lb/>
            at once, the other that he made his offering from the fruits, <lb/>
            and not from the first fruits, which have a name in one word, <lb/>
            the first fruits. Let us now examine into each of these <lb/>
            subjects of reproach, and first into that which is first in order, <lb/>
            we must do good works, hastening with all speed, and labouring <lb/>
            to outstrip others, casting away all slowness and delay. And the <lb/>
            best of all good works is the pleasing the first good without any <lb/>
            postponement of energy, on which account it is also enjoined. <lb/>
            " If thou vowest a vow, thou shalt not delay to perform it." || <lb/>
            A vow now is a request for good things addressed to God, and <lb/>
            the injunction is, that when one has attained the object of <lb/>
            one's hopes, one must offer offerings of gratitude to God, and <lb/>
            not to one's self, and to offer them if possible without any loss of <lb/>
            time, and without any delay; and of those who do not act rightly <lb/>
            in this particular, some through forgetfulness of the benefits <lb/>
            which they have received, have failed in that great and <lb/>
            beautiful virtue of thankfulness, and others from an excessive <lb/>
            conceit, have looked upon themselves as the authors of the good <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis iv. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlvi. 34. </note><note type="footnote"> || Deuteronomy xxiii. 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> % Exodus viii. 2G. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="218"/>
            things which have befallen them, and have not attributed them <lb/>
            to him. who is really the cause of them.</p>
          <p>A third class are they who commit an offence slighter indeed <lb/>
            than the fault of these latter, but more serious than that of the <lb/>
            first mentioned, for though they confess that the supreme Ruler <lb/>
            is the cause of the good that has befallen them, they still say <lb/>
            that they deserved to receive it, for that they are prudent, <lb/>
            and courageous. aud temperate, and just, so that they may well <lb/>
            on these accounts be esteemed by God to be worthy of his <lb/>
            favours.</p>
          <p>XIV. Xow the holy scriptures are opposed to all these <lb/>
            classes, and reply to each of them, saying to the first clAss <lb/>
            which has discarded recollection, and humbled forgetfulness. <lb/>
            “Take care, my good man, lest when you have eaten and are <lb/>
            filled, aud when you have built tine houses and inhabited them, <lb/>
            and when your flocks and your herds have increased, and <lb/>
            when your silver and gold, and all that you possess is <lb/>
            multiplied, you be lifted up in your heart, and forget the Lord <lb/>
            your God.” * When is it then that you do not forget God' <lb/>
            when you do not forget yourself; for if you remember your <lb/>
            own nothingness in every particular, you will also be sure to <lb/>
            remember the exceeding greatness of God in everything.</p>
          <p>And Moses reproves the man who looks upon himself as the <lb/>
            cause of the good things that have befallen him in this manner, <lb/>
            “Say not,”says he. "my own might, or the strength of my <lb/>
            right hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always <lb/>
            the Lord thy God, who giveth thee the might to acquire <lb/>
            power.”†</p>
          <p>And he who conceives that he was deserving to receive the <lb/>
            possession and enjoyment of good things, may be taught to <lb/>
            change his opinion by the oracle which says. “ You do not enter <lb/>
            into this land to possess it because of thy righteousness, or <lb/>
            because of the holiness of thy heart: but. in the first place, <lb/>
            because of the iniquity of these nations, since God has brought <lb/>
            on them the destruction of wickedness: and in the second <lb/>
            place that he may establish the covenant which he swore to <lb/>
            our <unclear>athers</unclear>.”‡</p>
          <p>Now by the covenant of God his graces are figuratively <lb/>
            meant <unclear>mor</unclear> is it right to oder to him anything that is im­ <lb/>
            perfect). as all the gifts of the uncreated God are complete and <lb/>
            entirely perfect, and virtue is a thing complete among existing <note type="footnote"> * Deut. viii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Deut. viii. IF. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. is. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="219"/>
            things, and so is the course of action in accordance with it. <lb/>
            If therefore we discard forgetfulness and ingratitude, and self- <lb/>
            love, and the present wickedness of all they; things, namely, <lb/>
            self-opinion, we shall no longer through our delay miss attaining <lb/>
            the genuine worship of God, but outrunning and bounding on <lb/>
            beyond all created beings, before we embrace any mortal thing <lb/>
            we shall meet our master himself, having prepared ourselves <lb/>
            to do the things which he commands us.</p>
          <p>XV. For Abraham also, having come with all haste and <lb/>
            speech and eagerness, exhorts virtue, that is to say, Sarah, <lb/>
            “ to hasten and knead three measures of fine meal, and to <lb/>
            make cakes upon the hearth."* When God, being attended <lb/>
            by two of the heavenly powers as guards, to wit, by authority <lb/>
            and goodness, he himself, the one God being between them, <lb/>
            presented an appearance of the figures to the visual soul; each <lb/>
            of which figures was not measured in any respect; for God <lb/>
            cannot be circumscribed, nor are his powers capable of being <lb/>
            defined by lines, but he himself measures everything. His <lb/>
            goodness therefore is the measure of all good things, and his <lb/>
            authority is the measure of things in subjection, and the <lb/>
            Governor of the universe himself, is the measure of all things <lb/>
            to the corporeal and incorporeal. On which account, his <lb/>
            powers also having been looked upon in the light of rules and <lb/>
            models, have weighed and measured other things with refe­ <lb/>
            rence to them. Now it is very good that these three measures <lb/>
            should, as it were, be kneaded together in the soul, and <lb/>
            mixed up together, in order that so the soul, being persuaded <lb/>
            that the supreme being is God, who has raised his head above <lb/>
            all his powers, and who is beheld independently of them, and <lb/>
            who makes himself visible in them, may receive the characters <lb/>
            of his power and beneficence, and becoming initiated into the <lb/>
            perfect mysteries, may not be too ready to divulge the divine <lb/>
            secrets to any one, but may treasure them up in herself, and <lb/>
            keeping a check over her speech, may conceal them in silence; <lb/>
            for the words of the scripture are, " To make secret cakes;” <lb/>
            because the sacred and mystic statements about the one <lb/>
            uncreated Being, and about his powers, ought to be kept <lb/>
            secret; since it does not belong to every one to keep the <lb/>
            deposit of divine mysteries properly.</p>
          <p>XVI. For the stream of the intemperate soul, flowing out­ <lb/>
            wards through the mouth and tongue, is pumped up and poured <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 6 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="220"/>
            into all ears. Some of which having wide channels, keep that <lb/>
            which is poured into them with all cheerfulness; but others, <lb/>
            through the narrowness of the passages, are unable to be <lb/>
            bedewed by it. But that which overflows being poured forth <lb/>
            in an unrestrained manner, is scattered in every direction : so <lb/>
            that what has been concealed escapes and floats on the top of <lb/>
            it, and, like a random torrent of mud, bears along with it in its <lb/>
            flood, things worthy of being tended with all care. In refe­ <lb/>
            rence to which, those persons appear to me to have come to a <lb/>
            right decision who have been initiated in the lesser mysteries <lb/>
            before learning anything of these greater ones. " For they <lb/>
            baked their flour which they brought out of Egypt, baking <lb/>
            secret cakes of unleavened bread."* That is to say, they <lb/>
            dealt with the untameable and savage passions, softening them <lb/>
            with reason as they would knead bread ; for they did not <lb/>
            divulge the manner of their kneading and improving it, as it <lb/>
            was derived from some divine system of preparation; but they <lb/>
            treasured it up in their secret stores, not being elated at the <lb/>
            knowledge of the mystery, but yielding and being lowly as <lb/>
            to their boasting.</p>
          <p>XVII. Let us then, with reference to our gratitude to and <lb/>
            honouring of the omnipotent God, be active and ready, depre­ <lb/>
            cating all sluggishness and delay; for those who are passing <lb/>
            over from obedience to the passions to the contemplation of <lb/>
            virtue, are enjoined to keep the passover with their loins <lb/>
            girded up, being ready to do service, and binding up the <lb/>
            burden of the flesh, or, as it is expressed, their shoes, " stand­ <lb/>
            ing upright, and firmly on their feet, and having in their <lb/>
            hands a staff,”† that is to say education, with the object of <lb/>
            succeeding without any failure in all the affairs of life ; and <lb/>
            lastly, “ to eat the passover in haste." For, by the passover, <lb/>
            is signified the crossing over of the created and perishable <lb/>
            being to God :-and very appropriately ; for there is no single <lb/>
            good thing which does not belong to God, and which is not <lb/>
            divine.</p>
          <p>Seek it therefore, quickly, 0 my soul! as did that practiser <lb/>
            of contemplation, Jacob, who, when his father asked him, " How <lb/>
            found you this so quickly, 0 my son? ”‡ answered, with a <lb/>
            doctrine concealed underneath his words, " The Lord God <lb/>
            brought it before me." For he, being well skilled in many <lb/>
            matters, knew that whatever creation bestows on the soul is <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xii. 34,</note><note type="footnote"> t Exodus xii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxvii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="221"/>
            confirmed by long time, as those men know who give to their <lb/>
            pupils arts, and lessons in arts : for their case is not like that <lb/>
            of men who pour water into a vessel, they are not in a moment <lb/>
            able to fill their minds with the lessons which have been brought <lb/>
            before them. But when the fountain of wisdom, that is to say, <lb/>
            God, gives knowledge of the sciences to the race of mankind, <lb/>
            he gives it to them without any limitation of time. But they, <lb/>
            as being disciples of the only wise Being, and being compe­ <lb/>
            tent by nature, quickly accomplish the discovery of the things <lb/>
            which they seek to understand.</p>
          <p>XVIII. But the principal virtue of pupils is to endeavour <lb/>
            to imitate their perfect master, as far as those who are <lb/>
            imperfect can imitate a perfect man. But the master is more <lb/>
            rapid than any time, which did not even co-operate with him <lb/>
            when he was creating the universe, since it is plain that time <lb/>
            itself was created at the same moment that the world was <lb/>
            made. For God, while he spake the word, did at the same <lb/>
            moment create; nor did he allow anything to come between <lb/>
            the word and the deed; and if one may advance a doctrine <lb/>
            which is pretty nearly true, His word is his deed. But among <lb/>
            the race of mankind nothing is more easily moved than the <lb/>
            word ; for by its rapidity and by the volubility of its nouns and <lb/>
            verbs, it outstrips even the comprehension which hastens to <lb/>
            overtake them. As, therefore, everlasting springs, which are <lb/>
            poured down in rivers, have a course which never ceases, the <lb/>
            stream as it comes on continually taking up the cessation of the <lb/>
            waves which have preceded, so too the abundant flow of words, <lb/>
            when they begin to be poured forth, keep pace with the most <lb/>
            swiftly-moving of all the qualities which are in us, namely, the <lb/>
            mind, which can itself outstrip even flying natures.</p>
          <p>As therefore the uncreated God outstrips all creation, so <lb/>
            also does the word of the uncreated God outrun the word of <lb/>
            creation, and is borne on with exceeding swiftness in the clouds. <lb/>
            On which account God speaks freely, saying, " Now you shall <lb/>
            see, because my word shall overtake you."* As the divine <lb/>
            word can outstrip and overtake everything, but if his word can <lb/>
            thus outstrip everything, much more can he who utters it, <lb/>
            as he testifies in another place, where he says, " Here am I, <lb/>
            I stood here before you.”† For he declares here that he stood <lb/>
            before any created being : and he who is here is also there, <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xvi. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="222"/>
            and in other places, and every where, having filled every place <lb/>
            in every direction, and having left nothing whatever destitute <lb/>
            of himself: for he does not say, " Here I stand and there, but <lb/>
            now also when I am present do I stand there also at the same <lb/>
            moment not being moved or changing his place so as to oc­ <lb/>
            cupy one place and to quit another, but using one intense motion.</p>
          <p>Very properly therefore do his subject children, imitating <lb/>
            the nature of their father, do all that is right without any <lb/>
            delay, and with all diligence, their most excellent employment <lb/>
            being the paying prompt and unremitting honour to God.</p>
          <p>XIX. But Pharaoh, the squanderer of all things, not being <lb/>
            able himself to receive the conception of virtues unconnected <lb/>
            with time, inasmuch as he was mutilated as to the eyes of his <lb/>
            soul, by which alone incorporeal natures are comprehended, <lb/>
            would not endure to be benefited by virtues unconnected with <lb/>
            time; but being weighed down by soulless opinions, I mean <lb/>
            here by the frogs, animals which utter a sound and noise <lb/>
            wholly void and destitute of reality, when Moses says, " appoint <lb/>
            a time to me when I may pray for you and for your servants <lb/>
            that God will make the frogs to disappear,”* though he ought, <lb/>
            as he was in very imminent necessity, to have said, Pray this <lb/>
            moment, nevertheless postponed it, saying, " Pray to-morrow," <lb/>
            in order that he might in every case preserve the folly of his <lb/>
            impiety. And this happens to nearly all those men who hesi­ <lb/>
            tate and vacillate between two opinions, even if they do not <lb/>
            confess it in express words. For when any thing unexpected <lb/>
            befalls them, inasmuch as they did not previously believe firmly <lb/>
            in God the Saviour, they take refuge in the assistance of­ <lb/>
            created things, of physicians, of herbs, of the composition of <lb/>
            drugs, in a carefully considered plan of life, and in any other <lb/>
            aid which may be derived from mortal man. And if any one <lb/>
            were to say to them, " Flee, 0 ye wretched men, to Him who is <lb/>
            the only physician for the diseases of the soul, and discard all <lb/>
            this falsely called assistance which ye are seeking to find in <lb/>
            the creature who is subject to the same sufferings as yourselves," <lb/>
            they would laugh at and ridicule him; saying, " Tell us <lb/>
            this to-morrow." Since, even if any thing were to happen to <lb/>
            them they would not supplicate the Deity to avert the present <lb/>
            evils from them.</p>
          <p>But when it is found that there is no relief from man, and <note type="footnote"> 0 Exodus viii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="223"/>
            when even all the remedies are proved to be injurious, then in <lb/>
            great perplexity they renounce all ideas of assistance from <lb/>
            other quarters, and, like wretched men as they are and sorely <lb/>
            against their will, they reluctantly and tardily flee to the only <lb/>
            Saviour, God. But he, as well knowing that there is no <lb/>
            dependence to be placed on reformation extorted by necessity, <lb/>
            does not apply his law to every one of them, but only to those <lb/>
            in whose case it appears good and suitable.</p>
          <p>Let every reasoning therefore that thinks that all posses­ <lb/>
            sions belong to itself, and that honours itself before God, for <lb/>
            the expression, "sacrificing after a few days," involves such a <lb/>
            notion as this, know that it is liable to the accusation of impiety.</p>
          <p>XX. We have now adequately gone through the first article <lb/>
            of our accusation against Cain. And the second is of this nature <lb/>
            Why does he bring the first fruits of the fruits of the earth, but <lb/>
            not of the first produce ? May it not be for the same reason, <lb/>
            that he may give the pre-eminence in honour to creation, and <lb/>
            may requite God himself with what is the second best ? For <lb/>
            as there are some persons who place the body before the soul, <lb/>
            the slave before the mistress, so also there are persons who <lb/>
            honour the creation more than God, though the lawgiver <lb/>
            delivered this injunction, that "we should bring the first fruits <lb/>
            of the first produce of the earth into the house of God," * and <lb/>
            not assign them to ourselves. For it is just to refer all <lb/>
            the first motions of the soul, whether in point of order or of <lb/>
            power, to God. Now the first things in point of order are such <lb/>
            as these, in which we participated from the first moment of <lb/>
            our original birth: nourishment, growth, sight, hearing, taste, <lb/>
            smell, touch, speech, the mind, the parts of the soul, the parts <lb/>
            of the body, the energies of these parts, and in short all the <lb/>
            motions and conditions which are in accordance with nature.</p>
          <p>But those things which are first in consideration and in <lb/>
            power are good actions, the virtues, and conduct in accordance <lb/>
            with the virtues. It is right therefore to offer the first fruits <lb/>
            of these things: and the first fruits are the language of grati­ <lb/>
            tude sent up from sincere truth of mind. And this language <lb/>
            divides itself according to appropriate divisions in the same <lb/>
            manner as the lyre and the other musical instruments are <lb/>
            divided. For in each of those instruments each sound is by <lb/>
            itself harmonious, and also exceedingly adapted to making a <note type="footnote"> it Exodus xxiii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="224"/>
            symphony with the rest. As in grammar also those of the <lb/>
            elements which are called vowels are both capable of being <lb/>
            uttered by themselves, and they also make a complete sound <lb/>
            in conjunction with other letters. But nature which has <lb/>
            created many powers in ourselves, some consisting of the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses, some reasoning and intellectual and which has <lb/>
            directed each to some appropriate work, and which again has <lb/>
            adapted all in due proportion by a union and harmony with <lb/>
            one another, may be most properly pronounced happy both in <lb/>
            each particular and in all of them.</p>
          <p>XXI. On which account if you bring a sacrifice of the first <lb/>
            fruits, you must divide it as the sacred scripture teaches, first <lb/>
            of all offering those fruits which are green, then those which <lb/>
            are toasted, then those which are cut up, and after all the <lb/>
            others those which are ground. Those which are green, on <lb/>
            this account, because he teaches those who are lovers of the old, <lb/>
            and obsolete, and fabulous times, and who do not comprehend <lb/>
            the rapid power of God, illimitable by time, warning them to <lb/>
            adopt new, and flourishing, and vigorous thoughts, in order <lb/>
            that they may not embrace false opinions from being nourished <lb/>
            among the old fabulous systems which a long lapse of ages has <lb/>
            handed down to the deceiving of mortals; but that, receiving <lb/>
            new and fresh good things in all abundance from God, who <lb/>
            never grows old, but who is always young and vigorous, they <lb/>
            may be taught to think nothing old that is with him, and <lb/>
            nothing passed away or obsolete, but to look upon everything <lb/>
            as created and existing without any limitation as to time.</p>
          <p>XXII. On which account he says in another place, " Thou <lb/>
            shalt rise up from before a hoary head, and thou shalt honour <lb/>
            the face of an elder."* As if the difference were very great. <lb/>
            For what is hoary is that time which energizes not at all, from <lb/>
            which one ought to rise up, and depart, and flee, avoiding that <lb/>
            idea which deceives tens of thousands, that time has a natural <lb/>
            capacity of doing something. But by an elder is meant one <lb/>
            who is worthy of honour, and respect, and of pre-eminence, the <lb/>
            examination of whom is committed to Moses, the friend of <lb/>
            God. For those whom thou knowest," says God to Moses, <lb/>
            " they are the elders."t As he was a mail who admitted no <lb/>
            innovations of any kind, but was by custom attached to his <lb/>
            elders, and to those who were worthy of the highest honours. <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xi. 16. </note> <pb n="225"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is advantageous, therefore, if not with reference to the <lb/>
            acquisition of perfect virtue, still at all events with reference to <lb/>
            political considerations, both to be nourished in ancient and <lb/>
            primeval opinions, and also to be acquainted with the ancient <lb/>
            records of glorious actions, which historians and the whole race <lb/>
            of poets have delivered to their contemporaries and to sub­ <lb/>
            sequent ages, to be preserved in their recollection. But when <lb/>
            the sudden light of self-taught wisdom has shone upon those <lb/>
            who had no foreknowledge or expectation of it, and opening <lb/>
            the previously closed eyes of the soul, makes men spectators of <lb/>
            knowledge instead of being merely hearers of it, implanting in <lb/>
            the mind the swiftest of the outward senses, sight, instead of <lb/>
            hearing, which is slower; it is then in vain to exercise the ears <lb/>
            with speeches.</p>
          <p>XXIII. On which account it is said also : " And ye shall eat <lb/>
            old store, and old food from the old store, and you shall also bring <lb/>
            forward the old out of the sight of the new.”* As it is fitting <lb/>
            to repudiate no ancient piece of learning from considerations of <lb/>
            time, while we endeavour to meet with the writings of wise <lb/>
            men, and to be present as it were with the opinions and <lb/>
            expositions of those who relate ancient matters, and to be <lb/>
            always fond of inquiring about the former ages of men, and <lb/>
            ancient events, since it is the pleasantest of all things to be <lb/>
            ignorant of nothing. But when God causes new shoots of <lb/>
            self-taught wisdom to spring up in the soul, then it behoves us <lb/>
            immediately to circumscribe and to contract the things which <lb/>
            we have acquired from instruction, which of their own accord <lb/>
            do return and flow back to their source. For it is impossible <lb/>
            that one who is a follower, or a friend, or a disciple of God, or <lb/>
            any other name which one may think fit to call him, should <lb/>
            tolerate mortal lessons.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And let the ripeness of the new soul be toasted. That <lb/>
            is to say, as gold is tried in the fire, let this also be tested by <lb/>
            powerful reason. And the being consolidated is a sign of <lb/>
            having been tried, and tested, and approved. For as the fruit <lb/>
            of flourishing stalks of corn is toasted, that it may no longer be <lb/>
            damp, and as this cannot in the nature of things take place <lb/>
            without fire, so also is it necessary that the young and fresh <lb/>
            ripeness, advancing by means of powerful and unalterable <lb/>
            reason to the perfection of virtue, must be made solid and <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxvi. 10. </note> <note type="footnote">Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="226"/>
            stable. But it is the natural characteristic of reason not only <lb/>
            to ripen speculations in the soul, preventing them from dis­ <lb/>
            solving, but also vigorously to put an end to the impetuosity of <lb/>
            irrational passion.</p>
          <p>Behold the practises of contemplation, Joseph, cooking it, <lb/>
            when, " Esau is in a moment discovered to be fainting."* <lb/>
            For wickedness and passion are the foundations of those <lb/>
            who love themselves, supported on which the man, when <lb/>
            he sees them defeated and extinguished by reason which has <lb/>
            refuted them, does not unnaturally relax his exertions and <lb/>
            his strength. But suppose the language is not confused, but <lb/>
            divided into appropriate divisions, the meaning of the expression, <lb/>
            “ those that are cut up," is something of this kind. For in <lb/>
            everything order is better than disorder, and most especially is <lb/>
            it so in the most swiftly flowing nature-speech.</p>
          <p>XXV. We must therefore divide it into the principal heads, <lb/>
            which are called incidents, and we must assign to each its <lb/>
            appropriate preparation, imitating in this point skilful <lb/>
            archers, who, when they have chosen a mark, endeavour to <lb/>
            shoot every one of their arrows straight at it. For the head <lb/>
            resembles the mark, and the preparation is similar to the <lb/>
            arrows. And thus the most excellent of all branches of <lb/>
            learning, speech, is harmoniously connected together. For the <lb/>
            lawgiver cuts leaves of gold into thin hairs, so as to plait <lb/>
            appropriate works of that material in a durable manner, And <lb/>
            in like manner, speech, which is more precious than gold, is <lb/>
            completed in a praiseworthy manner of innumerable varieties <lb/>
            of ideas, when, being divided into the thinnest possible heads, <lb/>
            after the fashion of a woven web, it receives an harmonious <lb/>
            demonstration, like a work of the distaff.</p>
          <p>It is enjoined therefore that sacrificers, when they have <lb/>
            flayed the burnt offering, shall cut it up joint by joint, in order <lb/>
            in the first place that the soul may appear naked without any <lb/>
            coverings, such as are made by empty and false opinions; and <lb/>
            in the second place that it may be able to receive suitable <lb/>
            divisions, for virtue is a whole and one, which is divided into <lb/>
            corresponding species, such as prudence and temperance, <lb/>
            justice and courage, that we, knowing the differences of each of <lb/>
            these qualities, may submit to a voluntary service of them both <lb/>
            in their entirety and in particulars. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxv, 29. </note> <pb n="227"/>
            </p>
          <p>And let us consider how we may train the soul so that it may <lb/>
            not, from being thrown into a state of confusion, be deceived by <lb/>
            general and unintelligible appearances, but that by making <lb/>
            proper divisions of things it may be able to inspect and <lb/>
            examine each separate thing with all accuracy, adopting <lb/>
            language which will not, through being borne forward by <lb/>
            disorderly impetuosity, cause any indistinctness, but being <lb/>
            divided into its appropriate headings and into the demon­ <lb/>
            strations suitable to each, will be compounded like some living <lb/>
            animal of perfect parts, properly put together. And we ought <lb/>
            to apply ourselves to a continual meditation on and practice of <lb/>
            these things, if we wish the use of them to be confirmed in <lb/>
            us, as after having touched knowledge, not to abide in it is like <lb/>
            tasting meat and drink, but being prevented from feeding on <lb/>
            them in sufficient quantities.</p>
          <p>XXVI. After those that are cut up, it 'was very natural to <lb/>
            make an offering of such as are ground ; that is to say, it is <lb/>
            natural after the division to dwell among and pass one's leisure <lb/>
            among what had been thus discovered, for continued practice <lb/>
            produces firm and stable knowledge, just as continued in­ <lb/>
            difference produces ignorance Therefore numbers of men from <lb/>
            fear of the labour of practice, have lost the strength with which <lb/>
            they were endowed by nature, whom those men have not <lb/>
            imitated who nourished their souls on prophecy, which is <lb/>
            signified under the name of manna, " for they ground it in <lb/>
            mills or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made <lb/>
            cakes of it,” * everyone of them knowing well how to knead <lb/>
            and soften the heavenly language of virtue for the sake of <lb/>
            making the intellect firmer.</p>
          <p>When therefore you confess that the young and fresh corn, <lb/>
            that is to say vigour, and the toasted corn, that is to say speech <lb/>
            tried in the fire and invincible, and the corn cut up, which <lb/>
            signifies the cutting up and division of things, and the corn <lb/>
            ground, that is to say anxious care about and examination into <lb/>
            what has been found out, do all proceed from God, you will <lb/>
            then be offering a sacrifice of the first fruits of the first <lb/>
            produce, of the first and best things which the soul has <lb/>
            brought forth; and even if we are slow, nevertheless he does <lb/>
            not delay to take to himself those who are fit to worship <lb/>
            him. For "I will take," " says he, "you to be a people for <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="228"/>
            myself, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people : <lb/>
            I am the Lord."</p>
          <p>XXVII. These now, and such as these, are the accusations <lb/>
            brought against Cain, who after some days offered sacrifice; <lb/>
            but Abel did not bring the same offerings, nor did he bring <lb/>
            his offerings in the same manner; but instead of inanimate <lb/>
            things he brought living sacrifices, and instead of younger <lb/>
            things, worthy only of the second place, he offered what was <lb/>
            older and of the first consideration, and instead of what was <lb/>
            weak he offered what was strong and fat, for he says that " he <lb/>
            made his sacrifice of the first-born of his flocks, and of their <lb/>
            fat,"* according to the most holy commandment.</p>
          <p>Now the commandment is as follows: "And it shall be," say <lb/>
            the scriptures, " when God shall bring thee forth into the land <lb/>
            of the Canaanites, in the manner which he swore to thy <lb/>
            fathers, and shall give it to thee, that thou shalt set apart <lb/>
            unto the Lord all that openeth the womb of all thy flocks, and <lb/>
            of all the beasts which thou hast, and shalt set apart all the <lb/>
            males for the Lord. Every offspring of an ass that openeth the <lb/>
            womb shalt thou exchange for a sheep; and if thou dost not <lb/>
            exchange it thou shall redeem it with money."t For that <lb/>
            which openeth the wound is Abel, that is to say, a gift, the <lb/>
            first-born, and you must examine how and when it is to be <lb/>
            offered up ; now the most suitable time is when God shall <lb/>
            lead thee into fluctuating reason, that is to say, into the land <lb/>
            of the Canaanites, not in any chance manner, but in the <lb/>
            manner in which he himself swore that he would; not in <lb/>
            order that being tossed about hither and thither in the surf <lb/>
            and tempest and heavy waves, you may be deprived of all rest <lb/>
            or stability, but that having escaped from such agitation you <lb/>
            may enjoy fine weather and a calm, aud reaching virtue as a <lb/>
            place of refuge, or port, or harbour of safety for ships, may <lb/>
            lie in safety and steadiness.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But when Moses says that God swears, we must <lb/>
            consider whether he really asserts this as a thing appropriate <lb/>
            for him to do; since to very many people it appears incon­ <lb/>
            sistent with the character of God ; for the meaning implied in <lb/>
            an oath is, that it is the testimony- of God in a matter which is <lb/>
            doubtful. But to God there is nothing uncertain and nothing <lb/>
            in doubt; as it is he who demonstrates clearly to others all the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 3. </note> <note type="footnote"> † Exodus xiii. 11, </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="229"/>
            clear indications of truth. And accordingly he is in need of <lb/>
            no witness; for neither is there any other god of equal honour <lb/>
            with him. I omit to mention that he who bears witness, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he bears witness, is better than he to whom he <lb/>
            bears witness; for the one stands in need of something, and <lb/>
            the other serves him : and he who serves is more worthy of <lb/>
            credit than he who requires to be served. But it is impious <lb/>
            to conceive that any thing can be better than the Cause of all <lb/>
            things, since there is nothing equal to him, no tiling that is <lb/>
            even a little inferior to him ; * but every thing which exists in <lb/>
            the world is found to be in its whole genus inferior to God.</p>
          <p>Now it is for the sake of obtaining credence that those men <lb/>
            who are disbelieved have recourse to an oath. But God is to be <lb/>
            believed when simply he says any thing ; so that, as far as cer­ <lb/>
            tainty goes, his words do in no respect differ from oaths. And <lb/>
            it happens, indeed, that our opinions are confirmed by an oath ; <lb/>
            but that an oath itself is confirmed by the addition of the name <lb/>
            of God. God, therefore, does not become credible because of <lb/>
            an oath, but even an oath is confirmed by God.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Why, then, has this hierophant thought fit to intro­ <lb/>
            duce him as swearing ? That he might demonstrate the weak­ <lb/>
            ness of the created being, and after he had demonstrated it, <lb/>
            might comfort him: for we are not able at all times to have <lb/>
            ready in our soul that principal fact which ought to be remem­ <lb/>
            bered concerning God, namely, that " God is not as a man.”† <lb/>
            So that we may rise above those assertions which are advanced <lb/>
            concerning man; but we, since we have the greatest share in <lb/>
            what is mortal, and since we are not able to conceive any tiling <lb/>
            apart from ourselves, and have no power to go beyond or to <lb/>
            escape our own calamities, but since we have got into mortality <lb/>
            as snails have into their shells, and since we are revolved <lb/>
            round and round ourselves in a ball, like so many hedgehogs, <lb/>
            and have only the same opinions about the blessed and immor­ <lb/>
            tal God which we have about ourselves, avoiding all absurdity <lb/>
            of assertion, such for instance as that God has the same form <lb/>
            as man, but in reality being guilty of the impiety of attributing <note type="footnote"> * The similarity to Horace is here again very remarkable. Horace, <lb/>
            speaking of the Parent and Governor of the universe, says— <lb/>
            Undo nil majus generatur ipso, <lb/>
            Nec viget quicquam simile, aut secundum.—Od. I. xii. 17. </note><note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxiii. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="230"/>
            to him that he has the same passsions as man; we do on this <lb/>
            account fashion for him in our minds hands and feet, a coming <lb/>
            in and a going out, hatred, aversion, alienation, and anger; <lb/>
            parts and passions very inconsistent with the character of the <lb/>
            Cause of all things, an oath by which is often an assistant of <lb/>
            our weakness. " If God shall give thee the things which thou <lb/>
            desirest," says Moses, speaking very eloquently and accurately; <lb/>
            for if he does not give them thou wilt not have them, since <lb/>
            every thing belongs to him, both things external, and the <lb/>
            body, and the outward sense, and the power of speech, and the <lb/>
            mind, and the energies and essences of all the faculties. And <lb/>
            not you, but all this world also, and whatever you cut off and <lb/>
            divide from it, you will find does not belong to you ; for you <lb/>
            do not possess the earth, or the water, or the air, or the hea­ <lb/>
            ven, or the stars, or any of tho kinds of animals or plants, <lb/>
            whether perishable or immortal, as your own; so that, whatever <lb/>
            from them you bring to offer to him as a sacrifice, you are <lb/>
            bringing as the possession of God, and not as your own.</p>
          <p>XXX. And take notice how very clearly it is enjoined, that <lb/>
            he who is sacrificing may take a part of what is offered, and <lb/>
            that he is not bound to offer the whole of what has been given <lb/>
            him. For nature has given us a countless number of things, <lb/>
            suitable to the human race, of all of which it receives no share <lb/>
            itself: for instance, she has given us creation, though she is <lb/>
            herself uncreate ; and food, though she has no need of food; and <lb/>
            growth, though she always remains in the same condition; <lb/>
            and age, with reference to time, though she herself admits <lb/>
            neither of addition nor of subtraction ; an organic body, which <lb/>
            she is incompetent to receive : also the powers of coming for­ <lb/>
            ward, of seeing, of applying food, and of disposing of it again <lb/>
            when digested; of judging between the differences of scents, <lb/>
            of using speech, of giving vent to laughter. There are also <lb/>
            many other things in us which have reference to our necessary <lb/>
            and beneficial uses: but one may pronounce these things in­ <lb/>
            different, but those which are confessedly good ought to be <lb/>
            attributed to and comprehended in nature.</p>
          <p>Come, therefore, let us investigate those things which are <lb/>
            especially admired among us, of the things which are really <lb/>
            goods, every one of which we pray to attain to at suitable sea­ <lb/>
            sons, and if we do attain to them, we are called the happiest <lb/>
            of men. Now who is there who is ignorant, that a happy old <lb/>
             <pb n="231"/>
            age and a happy death are the greatest of human goods? <lb/>
            neither of which can nature partake of, inasmuch as nature <lb/>
            can neither grow old nor die. And what is there extraor­ <lb/>
            dinary in the fact, if that which is uncreated does not con­ <lb/>
            descend to use the good things of created beings, when even <lb/>
            that which has been created desires different virtues, according <lb/>
            to the differences of ideas into which it is divided. At all <lb/>
            events men would not be rivals to women, nor would women <lb/>
            be rivals to men, in these matters with which the opposite sex <lb/>
            alone ought to have any concern. But if the women were to <lb/>
            emulate the pursuits of men they would be looked upon as <lb/>
            half men, and if the men were to apply themselves to the <lb/>
            pursuits of women they would acquire an evil reputation as <lb/>
            man-women.</p>
          <p>But are there not some virtues between which nature <lb/>
            herself has made such distinction, that by no practice can <lb/>
            they be brought into the common use of both sexes? At all <lb/>
            events, to sow and to beget children is the especial property <lb/>
            of man, according to his peculiar capacity, and no woman <lb/>
            could manage to do this. And again, the nature of man does <lb/>
            not make him capable of bearing children, which is the good <lb/>
            deed of women; therefore these things, which are innate in <lb/>
            the nature of man, cannot be predicated with propriety of <lb/>
            God, but it is done only through some catachrestical misappli­ <lb/>
            cation of terms, by which we make amends for our weakness. <lb/>
            You will take away therefore, 0 my mind, whatever is created <lb/>
            or mortal, or changeable or unconsecrated, from your concep­ <lb/>
            tions, regarding the uncreate God, immortal, unchangeable, <lb/>
            and holy, the only God, blessed for ever.</p>
          <p>XXXI. But it is most entirely in accordance with nature <lb/>
            " to sacrifice the males of every creature that openeth the <lb/>
            womb, to God."* For as nature has given to women the <lb/>
            womb, as the part most excellently adapted for the generation <lb/>
            of animals, so also for the production of things she has placed <lb/>
            a power in the soul, by means of which the mind conceives <lb/>
            and is in travail, and brings forth many things. But of the <lb/>
            ideas which are brought forth by the mind, some are male and <lb/>
            some female, as in the case of animals. Now the female <lb/>
            offspring of the soul are wickedness and passion, by which we <lb/>
            are made effeminate in every one of our pursuits; but a <note type="footnote"> it Exodus xiii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="232"/>
            healthy state of the passions and virtue is male, by which <lb/>
            we are excited and invigorated. Now of these, whatever be­ <lb/>
            longs to the fellowship of men must be attributed to God, and <lb/>
            everything that relates to the similarity to women must be <lb/>
            imputed to one's self, on which account the command was de­ <lb/>
            livered, " Of everything which openeth the womb the males <lb/>
            belong to the Lord.</p>
          <p>XXXII. But also he says, " The males belong to the Lord <lb/>
            of everything which openeth the womb, of thy flocks and of <lb/>
            thy cattle, and of all that belongs to thee." Having spoken <lb/>
            of the offspring of the principal part of the soul, he begins to <lb/>
            give us information about the produce of the irrational part, <lb/>
            which the outward senses have obtained for their inheritance, <lb/>
            which he likens to cattle, and to the young which are bred up <lb/>
            in the herds, being tame and tractable, inasmuch as they are <lb/>
            guided by the care of their overseer, that is to say, of the <lb/>
            shepherd; for those which are let run loose and are indulged <lb/>
            with freedom, are made wild from want of any one to make <lb/>
            them gentle. But those which have guides, such as goat­ <lb/>
            herds, cowherds, and shepherds, who are the managers of <lb/>
            every species of cattle, they I say are of necessity made tame. <lb/>
            Moreover the genus of the outward senses is formed by <lb/>
            nature, so as to be in one instance wild and in another tract­ <lb/>
            able ; it is wild, when having shaken off the rein of the mind <lb/>
            as of its herdsman, it is borne on irrationally towards the <lb/>
            external objects of the outward senses; but it is tame when <lb/>
            having yielded in an obedient manner to reason, which is the <lb/>
            guide of the discernment, it is regulated and directed in its <lb/>
            course by it.</p>
          <p>Whatever therefore it sees or hears, or, in short, whatever <lb/>
            it feels with any one of its inward senses according to the <lb/>
            injunction of the mind, all these things are male and perfect, <lb/>
            for goodness is added to each; but whatever is done without <lb/>
            any guide, in a state of anarchy, in such case the body ruins us <lb/>
            as anarchy ruins a city. Again, we must consider that those <lb/>
            motions of the outward senses which proceed in obedience to <lb/>
            the mind, and which of necessity are the better, do take place <lb/>
            according to the dispensation of God; but these which are <lb/>
            obstinate and disobedient, we must impute to ourselves, when <lb/>
            we are carried away irrationally by the impetuosity of the <lb/>
            outward senses.</p><pb n="233"/>
            
          <p>XXXIII. And he has commanded us to take a portion not <lb/>
            only from the things which have just been mentioned, but also <lb/>
            from the entire mass in combination. And the command is <lb/>
            couched in the following words: " And it shall be, when ye <lb/>
            eat of the fruit of the land, that ye shall take a part to offer up <lb/>
            as a heave-offering unto the Lord: ye shall offer up a cake of <lb/>
            the first of your dough for a heave-offering as ye do the heave- <lb/>
            offering of the threshing-floor, so shall ye offer it."* Now <lb/>
            speaking properly, if we must avow the exact truth, it is we <lb/>
            ourselves who are this dough; since many essences are <lb/>
            kneaded and combined together that we may be made perfect: <lb/>
            for the great Creator having mingled and kneaded together the <lb/>
            cold and hot, dry and moist, opposite properties, has made out <lb/>
            of them all one distinct combination, ourselves, from which the <lb/>
            expression dough is applied to us. Now, of this combination <lb/>
            in which body and soul, two most important divisions, are <lb/>
            united, the first fruits are to be consecrated. But the first <lb/>
            fruits are the holy motions of each in accordance with virtue; <lb/>
            on which account they have been compared to a threshing- <lb/>
            floor. As, therefore, on a threshing-floor there is wheat and <lb/>
            barley, and as many more of such things as are capable of <lb/>
            being separated by themselves, and busks and chaff, and what­ <lb/>
            ever other refuse is dissipated and scattered in different <lb/>
            directions, so too, with us, there are some things which are <lb/>
            excellent and useful, and which afford real nourishment, by <lb/>
            means of which a good life is brought to perfection ; all which <lb/>
            things we should attribute to God. But there are other things <lb/>
            which are not divine, which we must leave like refuse to the <lb/>
            race of mankind ; but from these some portions must be taken <lb/>
            away, and there are some entire virtues, free from all <lb/>
            wickedness, which it would be impious to mutilate by dividing <lb/>
            them, and which resemble those indivisible sacrifices, the <lb/>
            whole burnt-offerings, of which Isaac is a manifest pattern, <lb/>
            whom his father was commanded to offer up like a victim, <lb/>
            sharing in no destructive passion.</p>
          <p>And in another passage it is said, " My gifts, and my <lb/>
            offerings, and my sacrifices, ye will take care to offer to me at <lb/>
            my festivals not taking away from them, nor dividing them, <lb/>
            but bringing them forward full, and entire, and perfect; for <lb/>
            the feast of the soul is cheerfulness in perfect virtues; and <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xv. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="234"/>
            the perfect virtues are all those which the human race <lb/>
            exhibits, free from all stain or spot. But the wise man alone <lb/>
            can keep such a festival as this, and no other human being; <lb/>
            for it is a most rare thing to find a soul which has never tasted <lb/>
            of wickedness or passions.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Having therefore given an account of the domi­ <lb/>
            nant and subject divisions of the soul, and having shown what <lb/>
            portion in each is male and female, Moses proceeds after this <lb/>
            very consistently to explain the divisions of the body. For <lb/>
            being well aware that without labour and care it is not possible <lb/>
            to obtain a masculine offspring, he proceeds to say, " Every <lb/>
            foal of an ass that openeth the womb, thou shalt exchange for <lb/>
            the young of a sheep." * Which expression is equivalent to, <lb/>
            " Exchange all labour for improvement." For an ass is the <lb/>
            symbol of labour, being a much enduring animal, and a sheep <lb/>
            is the emblem of improvement, as its very' name shows,! being <lb/>
            a symbol of the care which is required to be expended in arts <lb/>
            and professions, and all other things which are matters of <lb/>
            instruction, and that with no negligence or indifference, but it <lb/>
            is necessary with all anxiety to have prepared one's mind to <lb/>
            encounter vigorously every amount of labour, and to strive not <lb/>
            to be held in bondage by ill-considered toil, but to find ad­ <lb/>
            vance and improvement by pushing on to the most glorious <lb/>
            end ; for labour is to be endured for the sake of improve­ <lb/>
            ment. But if you indeed receive fatigue from labour, <lb/>
            and still your nature does not advance at all on the road to <lb/>
            improvement, but is rather opposed to your becoming better by <lb/>
            progress, then abandon the pursuit and be quiet, for it is a <lb/>
            difficult task to go against nature. On which account the <lb/>
            scripture adds: “ And if you do not exchange it, you shall <lb/>
            ransom it for money ;” which means, but if you are not able <lb/>
            to exchange labour for improvement, then give up your labour ; <lb/>
            for the idea of ransoming carries with it the notion of emanci­ <lb/>
            pating the mind from vain and unproductive care.</p>
          <p>XXXV. But I am speaking here, not of the virtues but of <lb/>
            the arts of intermediate character, and of other necessary <lb/>
            studies which are conversant about the attention due to the <lb/>
            body, and about the abundance of external goods. But since <lb/>
            the labour which is applied to what is perfectly good and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiii. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">Πρόβατον</foreign>, derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">προβαίνω</foreign>, to advance forward. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="235"/>
            excellent, even if it fall short of attaining its object, is never­ <lb/>
            theless of such a character that it by itself does good to those <lb/>
            who exert it, while the things which are unconnected with <lb/>
            virtue unless their aim is attained, are entirely unprofitable. <lb/>
            For as in the case of animals, if you take away the head there <lb/>
            is an end of the whole animal, but the bead of actions is their <lb/>
            end, as they in a manner live if the end is arrived at, but if <lb/>
            you cut off their end and mutilate them they die. So too let <lb/>
            those athletes who are not able to gain the victory but who <lb/>
            are invariably defeated, condemn their trade; and if any mer­ <lb/>
            chant or captain of a ship in all his voyages meets with inces­ <lb/>
            sant disasters, let him turn away from the business and rest. <lb/>
            And those men who, having devoted themselves to the inter­ <lb/>
            mediate arts, have nevertheless through the ruggedness of <lb/>
            their nature been unable to acquire any learning, are to be <lb/>
            praised for abandoning them : for such studies are not practised <lb/>
            for the sake of the practice, but for the sake of the object <lb/>
            towards which the labourer is borne. If therefore nature <lb/>
            hinders one's improvement for the better, let us not strive <lb/>
            against her in an unprofitable way, but if she co-operates with <lb/>
            us then let us honour the Deity with first fruits and honours, <lb/>
            which are the ransom of our soul, emancipating it from sub­ <lb/>
            jection to cruel masters, and elevating it to freedom.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. For Moses confesses that the Levites who being <lb/>
            taken in exchange for the first-born, were appointed ministers <lb/>
            of him who alone is worthy to be ministered unto, were the <lb/>
            ransom of all the rest of the Israelites. " For I," says God, <lb/>
            " behold, I have chosen the Levites out of the midst of the <lb/>
            children of Israel, instead of every first-born that openeth the <lb/>
            womb from among the children of Israel; they shall be their ran­ <lb/>
            som and the Levites shall belong to me: for every first-born is <lb/>
            mine; from that day in which I smote all the first-born in the <lb/>
            land of Egypt, I dedicated to myself all the first-born of <lb/>
            Israel." *</p>
          <p>Reason which fled to God and became his suppliant, is what is <lb/>
            here called the Levite; God having taken this from the most <lb/>
            central and dominant part of the soul, that is to say, having taken <lb/>
            it to himself and appropriated it as his own share, thought it <lb/>
            worthy of the honour due to the first-born. So that from <lb/>
            these it is plain that Reuben is the first-born of Jacob, but <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus iii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="236"/>
            Levi the first born of Israel, the one having the honours of <lb/>
            seniority according to time, but the other according to dignity <lb/>
            and power. For Jacob being the symbol of labour and im­ <lb/>
            provement, is also the beginning of goodness of disposition, which <lb/>
            is signified in Reuben : but the fountain of contemplation of <lb/>
            the only wise being, according to which the name of Israel is <lb/>
            given, is the principle of being inclined to minister to him; <lb/>
            and of such ministry the Levite is the symbol.</p>
          <p>As therefore Jacob is found to be the inheritor of the <lb/>
            birth-right of Esau, eagerness in wickedness having been <lb/>
            defeated by virtuous labour, so also Levi, as one who devotes <lb/>
            himself to perfect virtue, will carry off the honours of seniority <lb/>
            from Reuben, the man of a good disposition. But the most <lb/>
            undeniable proof of perfection is for a man to be a fugitive to <lb/>
            God, having abandoned all concern for the things of creation.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. These then, to speak with strict propriety are <lb/>
            the prices to be paid for the preserving and ransoming of the <lb/>
            soul which is desirous of freedom. And may we not say that <lb/>
            in this way a very necessary doctrine is brought forward? <lb/>
            Namely that every wise man is a ransom for a worthless one, <lb/>
            who would not be able to last for even a short time, if the <lb/>
            wise man by the exertion of mercy and prudence did not take <lb/>
            thought for his lasting; as a physician opposing himself to <lb/>
            the infirmities of an invalid, and either rendering them <lb/>
            slighter, or altogether removing them unless the disease comes <lb/>
            on with irresistible violence, and surmounts all the ingenuity of <lb/>
            medical skill. And in this way Sodom was destroyed, since <lb/>
            there was, as it were, no good which could be put in the scale <lb/>
            sufficient to outweigh the unspeakable multitude of its <lb/>
            wickednesses. So that if the fiftieth number could have been <lb/>
            found, according to which an emancipation from the slavery of <lb/>
            the soul and complete freedom is proclaimed, or if any one of <lb/>
            the numbers below fifty which the wise Abraham enumerated <lb/>
            descending at last down to ten, the number peculiar to instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, the mind would not have been destroyed in so inglorious <lb/>
            a manner. We ought at times to endeavour as far as possible <lb/>
            to preserve those who are not on the point of being utterly <lb/>
            destroyed by the wickedness that is in them; imitating good <lb/>
            physicians who, even if they see that it is impossible for those <lb/>
            who are sick to recover, nevertheless apply their remedies <lb/>
            with cheerfulness, lest it should appear that it was owing to <lb/>
             <pb n="237"/>
            their neglect that the affair did not turn out as it was desired. <lb/>
            And if ever so slight a seed of good health is seen, this is to <lb/>
            be cherished as a spark of fire with all imaginable care; for <lb/>
            there is hope that if it can have its duration protracted and its <lb/>
            strength increased the man may for the future have a better <lb/>
            life and one more free from danger.</p>
          <p>Therefore when I see any good mail dwelling in any house <lb/>
            or city, I pronounce that house or that city happy, and I think <lb/>
            that its enjoyment of its present good things is sure, and that <lb/>
            its expectation of future happiness will be accomplished, inas­ <lb/>
            much as, for the sake of those who are worthy, God will <lb/>
            bestow his boundless and illimitable riches even on the un­ <lb/>
            worthy. And I pray that they may live to as great an age as <lb/>
            possible, since it is not possible that they should ever grow <lb/>
            old, as I expect that good fortune will remain to men as long <lb/>
            as these men are able to live in the practice of virtue. When, <lb/>
            therefore, I see or hear that any one of these men is dead, I <lb/>
            am exceedingly downcast and grieved, and I lament those who <lb/>
            are left behind alive as much as I lament them; for to the <lb/>
            one I see, that the necessary end has arrived in consistency <lb/>
            with the ordinances of nature, and that they have exhibited a <lb/>
            happy life and a glorious death. But I look upon the others <lb/>
            as now deprived of the great and mighty hand by which they <lb/>
            were saved, and as likely, now that they are bereft of it, soon <lb/>
            to feel the evils which are due to them, unless, indeed, instead <lb/>
            of the former men, who are gone, nature should be preparing <lb/>
            to make other young men shoot up, as in the case of a tree <lb/>
            which has already shed its ripe fruit for the nourishment and <lb/>
            enjoyment of those who are able to make use of it. As, there­ <lb/>
            fore, good men are the strongest part of cities, with a view to <lb/>
            their duration, so also in that state of each individual of us, <lb/>
            which consists of soul and body, the reasoning powers which <lb/>
            are attached to prudence and knowledge, are the firmest part <lb/>
            of its foundation ; which the legislator, using metaphorical lan­ <lb/>
            guage, calls the ransom and the first-born, on account of those <lb/>
            reasons which I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>In this way he also says, " The cities of the Levites are <lb/>
            ransomed for ever, because the minister of God enjoys eternal <lb/>
            freedom, according to the continuous revolutions of the ever­ <lb/>
            moving soul," and he admits incessant healing applications; <lb/>
             <pb n="238"/>
            for when he calls them ransomed, not once, but for ever, as <lb/>
            he says, he means to convey such a meaning as this, that <lb/>
            they are always in a state of revolution, and always in a state <lb/>
            of freedom, the state of revolution being implanted in them <lb/>
            because of their natural mortality, but their freedom coming <lb/>
            to them because of their ministration to God.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. But it is worth while to consider, in no passing <lb/>
            manner, why he granted the cities of the Levites to fugitives, <lb/>
            thinking it right that even these, who appear entirely impious, <lb/>
            should dwell with the most holy of men. Now these fugitives <lb/>
            are they who have committed, unintentionally, homicide. First <lb/>
            of all, therefore, we must repeat what is consistent with what <lb/>
            has been already said, that the good man is the ransom of the <lb/>
            worthless one, so that they who have sinned will naturally <lb/>
            come to those who have been hallowed, for the sake of being <lb/>
            purified; and, in the second place, we must consider that the <lb/>
            Levites admit the fugitives because they themselves are poten­ <lb/>
            tially fugitives; for as they are driven away from their coun­ <lb/>
            try, so these others also have left their children, their parents, <lb/>
            their brethren, their nearest and dearest things, in order that <lb/>
            they may receive an immortal inheritance instead of a mortal <lb/>
            one. But they differ, because the flight of the one is involun­ <lb/>
            tary, being caused by an unintentional action, but the flight <lb/>
            of the others is voluntary, from a love of what is most excel­ <lb/>
            lent ; and because the one have the Levites for a refuge ; but <lb/>
            the Levites have the Lord of all for their refuge, in order <lb/>
            that those who are imperfect may have the sacred scriptures <lb/>
            for their law; but that the others may have God for theirs, by <lb/>
            whom they are hallowed. Moreover, those who have com­ <lb/>
            mitted unintentional homicide, have been allotted the same <lb/>
            cities as the Levites to dwell in, because they also were <lb/>
            thought worthy of a privilege because of a holy slaughter.</p>
          <p>When therefore the soul being changed, came to honour <lb/>
            the Egyptian God, the body, as fine gold, then all the sacred <lb/>
            writings rushing forth of their own accord with defensive <lb/>
            weapons, namely demonstrations according to knowledge, <lb/>
            putting forward as their leader and general the chief priest, <lb/>
            and prophet, and friend of God, Moses, proclaimed an un­ <lb/>
            ce sing war in the cause of piety, and would not hear of peace <lb/>
            till they had put down all the doctrines of those who opposed <lb/>
             <pb n="239"/>
            them, so that they naturally came to inhabit the same <lb/>
            dwellings, inasmuch as they had done similar actions, though <lb/>
            not the same.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. There is also another opinion bruited about, as <lb/>
            something of a secret, which it is right to lay up in the ears of <lb/>
            the elders, not divulging it to the younger men; for of all the <lb/>
            most excellent powers which exist in God, there is one equal <lb/>
            to the others in honour, that is the legislative one (for he <lb/>
            himself is a lawgiver and the fountain of all laws, and all <lb/>
            particular lawgivers are subordinate to him), and this legis­ <lb/>
            lative power is divided in a twofold division, the one having <lb/>
            reference to the rewarding of those who do well, and the <lb/>
            other to the punishment of those who have sinned; accord­ <lb/>
            ingly the Levite is the minister of the former division, for he <lb/>
            performs all the ministrations which have a reference to <lb/>
            perfect holiness, according to which the human race is raised <lb/>
            up to and brought to the notice of God, either by whole burnt <lb/>
            offerings, or else by saving sacrifices, or else by repentance for <lb/>
            one's sins.</p>
          <p>But of the other and punishing division of the legislative <lb/>
            power, those who have committed unintentional homicide are <lb/>
            the ministers. And Moses bears witness to this saying, " He <lb/>
            was not willing, but God gave him into his hands,"* so that <lb/>
            his hands are here taken as instruments; but he who energizes <lb/>
            by their means in an invisible manner, must be the other <lb/>
            being, the invisible. Let therefore the two servants dwell <lb/>
            together, being the ministers of the tow species of the legislative <lb/>
            power; the Levite being the minister of the division which <lb/>
            has reference to the reward of them that do well, and the <lb/>
            unintentional homicide of the division which is conversant <lb/>
            about punishment.</p>
          <p>"But in the day," says God, " on which I smote the first- <lb/>
            born in the land of Egypt, I consecrated to myself all the first- <lb/>
            born of Israel." t And he says this not to lead us to suppose <lb/>
            that at the time when Egypt was stricken with this mighty <lb/>
            blow by the destruction of all its first-born, the first-born of <lb/>
            Israel all became holy, but because both in former times, and <lb/>
            now, and hereafter, and for ever, this naturally happens in the <lb/>
            case of the soul, that when the most dominant parts of blind <lb/>
            passion are destroyed, then the elder and most honourable <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxi. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xiii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="240"/>
            offspring of God, who sees everything with a piercing sight, <lb/>
            becomes holy ; for the departure of wickedness brings about <lb/>
            the entrance of virtue, as, on the other hand, when what is <lb/>
            good is driven away, then what was bad, having been lying in <lb/>
            ambush, comes in to supply the void. Jacob then had scarcely <lb/>
            at all gone out,* when Esau entered, not the mind which <lb/>
            receives everything, being stamped with the impression of <lb/>
            wickedness instead of the figures of virtue, if that is possible ; <lb/>
            but he would not have been able to effect this, for he will be <lb/>
            supplanted and overthrown by the wise man before he knows <lb/>
            it, the wise man being prompt to repel the impending injury <lb/>
            before it can affect him.</p>
          <p>XL. And he brings not only the first fruits from the first- <lb/>
            born, but also from the fat; showing by this that whatever there <lb/>
            is in the soul that is cheerful, or fat, or preservative and <lb/>
            pleasant, might all be surrendered to God. And I see also in <lb/>
            the arrangements established about sacrifices, that three things <lb/>
            are enjoined to be offered from the victims ; in the first place <lb/>
            the fat, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver, about which <lb/>
            we will speak separately; but not the brain or the heart <lb/>
            which it seemed natural should be dedicated before the other <lb/>
            parts, since, according to the language of the lawgiver, the <lb/>
            dominant power is recognised as existing in one of them.</p>
          <p>But may it not be owing to an exceeding holiness and to <lb/>
            very accurate consideration of the matter that he did not <lb/>
            bear these things to the faithful altar of God? because that <lb/>
            dominant part being subject to changes in either direction, <lb/>
            either for bad or good, in an indivisible moment of time <lb/>
            receives impressions which are continually changing, at one <lb/>
            time impressions of what is pure and approved, and at others <lb/>
            of an adulterated and base coinage.</p>
          <p>Therefore the lawgiver judging a place which was capable <lb/>
            of receiving both these opposite qualities, namely, what is <lb/>
            honourable, and what is disgraceful, and which was adapted to <lb/>
            each, and distributed equal honour to both, to be quite as <lb/>
            much impure as holy, removed it from the altar of God. For <lb/>
            what is disgraceful is profane, and what is profane is by all <lb/>
            means unholy; and this is why the dominant part is kept away <lb/>
            from sacrifices, but if it is subjected to examination, then, <lb/>
            when all its parts have been purified, it will be consecrated as <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="241"/>
            a burnt offering, free from all -stain, and from all pollution. <lb/>
            For this is the law respecting whole burnt offerings, that with <lb/>
            the exception of the refuse of the food, and of the skin which <lb/>
            are tokens of the weakness of the body and not of wickedness, <lb/>
            nothing else should be left to the creature, but that all the <lb/>
            other parts which exhibit the soul perfect in all its parts, <lb/>
            should be presented as a whole burnt offering to God.</p>

          <p>I. AND Cain said to Abel his brother, " Let us go to the <lb/>
            field. And it came to pass, that while they were in the field, <lb/>
            Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him."* What <lb/>
            Cain proposes to do is this: having by invitation led Abel oil <lb/>
            to a dispute, to convince him by main force, using plausible <lb/>
            and probable sophisms; for the field to which he invites him <lb/>
            to come, we may call a symbol of rivalry and contention, form­ <lb/>
            ing our conjectures of things that are uncertain from our per­ <lb/>
            ception of those which are manifest. For we see that most <lb/>
            contests, both in peace and in war, take place in the open <lb/>
            fields. In peace, therefore, all those who practise gymnastic <lb/>
            contests, seek for level race-courses and plain fields: and, in <lb/>
            a war, it is not usual to have battles, of either infantry or <lb/>
            cavalry, on hills; for many more disasters arise from the un­ <lb/>
            favourable character of the ground, than from anything that <lb/>
            the enemies do to one another.</p>
          <p>It. And a very great proof of this is the conduct of the <lb/>
            practiser of knowledge, Jacob, when warring against the oppo­ <lb/>
            site disposition, ignorance; when it is beheld in the field how <lb/>
            he regulates the irrational faculties in the soul after a fashion, <lb/>
            reproving and correcting them. " For Jacob having sent, <lb/>
            called Leah and Rachel into the plain where the flocks <lb/>
            were ;"t showing here clearly, that the plain is the symbol of <lb/>
            revolt and contention. And he calls them and says, " I see <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxi. 4. </note> <note type="footnote"> R </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="242"/>
            the face of your father, that it is not to me as it was yesterday <lb/>
            and the day before yesterday,* but the God of my father was <lb/>
            with me." And on this account I should be inclined to say, <lb/>
            Laban is not favourable to you because God is on your side ; <lb/>
            for in the soul, by which the external object of the outward <lb/>
            senses is honoured as the greatest good, perfect reason is not <lb/>
            found to exist; but in the soul, in which God walks, the ex­ <lb/>
            ternal object of the outward senses is not looked upon as the <lb/>
            greatest good, according to which object the name of Laban <lb/>
            is given and understood. And all those who, through the <lb/>
            improvement of their reason, are adorned in the similitude of <lb/>
            the Father, in consequence of education, unlearn all sub­ <lb/>
            serviency to the irrational impulses of the soul, selecting the <lb/>
            plain as a suitable place, for it is said to Joseph, " Are not <lb/>
            thy brethren keeping sheep in Sichem? Come, I will send <lb/>
            thee to them. And he said, Behold, here am I. And Jacob <lb/>
            said unto him, Go and see if thy brethren and the flocks are <lb/>
            well, and come and tell me. And he sent him from the val­ <lb/>
            ley of Chebron, and he came to Sichem, and a man found him <lb/>
            wandering in the plain : and the man asked him, What seek <lb/>
            est thou? And he said, I am seeking my brethren, tell me <lb/>
            where they are feeding their sheep. And the man said unto <lb/>
            him they have departed from hence, for I heard them saying, <lb/>
            Let us go to Dotham."f</p>
          <p>III. Therefore, from what has here been said it is plain, <lb/>
            that they make the halting-place of the irrational faculties, <lb/>
            which are in them, in the plain. But Joseph is sent unto <lb/>
            them because he is unable to bear the somewhat austere know­ <lb/>
            ledge of his father; that he may learn, under gentler instruc­ <lb/>
            tors, what is to be done and what will be advantageous; for <lb/>
            he uses a doctrine woven together from divers foundations, <lb/>
            very variegated and very artfully made, in reference to which <lb/>
            the law-giver says, that he had “ a robe of many colours made <lb/>
            for him ‡ signifying by this that he is an interpreter of <lb/>
            labyrinth-like learning, such as is hard to be explained ; for as <lb/>
            he philosophises more with a regard to political wisdom than <lb/>
            to truth, be brings into one place and connects together the <lb/>
            three kinds of good things, namely, external things, the <lb/>
            things concerning the body, and those concerning the soul, <lb/>
            things utterly different from one another in their whole na­ <note type="footnote"> <unclear/> Genesis xxxi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxvii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Genesis xxxvii. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="243"/>
            tures; wishing to show that each has need of each, and that <lb/>
            everything has need of everything; and that that which is <lb/>
            really the complete and perfect good, is composed of all these <lb/>
            things together, and that the parts of which this perfect good <lb/>
            is compounded are parts or elements of good, but are not <lb/>
            themselves perfect goods. In the same way, as neither fire, <lb/>
            nor earth, nor any one of the four elements, out of which the <lb/>
            universe was created, are the world, but the meeting and mix­ <lb/>
            ture of all the elements together ; in the same way also hap­ <lb/>
            piness ought not peculiarly to be sought for either in the ex­ <lb/>
            ternal things, or in the things of the body, or in the things of <lb/>
            the soul, taken by themselves; for each of the aforementioned <lb/>
            things has only the rank of parts and elements, but it must <lb/>
            be looked for in the combination of them all together.</p>
          <p>IV. He therefore is sent, to be untaught this doctrine, to <lb/>
            men who think nothing honourable but what is good, which is <lb/>
            the peculiar attribute of the soul as the soul; but all external <lb/>
            goods, which are called the good things of the body, they <lb/>
            believe to be only superfluities, and not true and real goods: <lb/>
            " For behold," says he, " thy brethren are tending their <lb/>
            sheep," that is to say, they are governing all the irrational <lb/>
            part that is in them, " in Sichem * and the name Sichem, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means a shoulder, the symbol of enduring <lb/>
            labour. For the men who are lovers of virtue endure a great <lb/>
            burden, the opposition to the body and the pleasure of the <lb/>
            body, and also the opposition to external things and to the <lb/>
            delights which arise from them. " Come, therefore, let me <lb/>
            send thee to them,"t that is to say, listen to my bidding and <lb/>
            come over, receiving in your mind a voluntary impulse to <lb/>
            learn better things. But up to the present time you are full <lb/>
            of self-complacency, as one who has received true instruction ; <lb/>
            for although you have not as yet plainly asserted this, you still <lb/>
            say that you are ready to be taught again, when you say, <lb/>
            " Behold, here am I," by which expression you appear to me <lb/>
            to exhibit your own rashness and easiness to be persuaded <lb/>
            more than your readiness to learn; and a proof of what I say <lb/>
            is this, " And a little afterwards the true man will find you <lb/>
            wandering in the way,”‡ while you would not have been led <lb/>
            astray, if you had come to the practice of virtue with a sound <lb/>
            intention. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxvii 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxvii. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Genesis xxxvii.15. </note> <note type="footnote"> It 2 </note> <pb n="244"/>
            </p>
          <p>And yet the adhortatory speech of your father's imposes no <lb/>
            irresistible necessity upon you, to turn of your own accord and <lb/>
            at the instigation of your own mind to better things; for he <lb/>
            says, " Go and see, " behold, consider, and meditate in the <lb/>
            matter with entire accuracy. For you ought first to know the <lb/>
            affair concerning which you are going to labour, and then after <lb/>
            that to proceed to a care how to accomplish it. But after you <lb/>
            have examined into it, and after you have inspected it carefully, <lb/>
            casting your eyes over the whole of the business, then examine, <lb/>
            i esides, those who have already given their attention to the <lb/>
            matter, and who have become practisers of it, whether now <lb/>
            that they do this they are in a sound state, and not mad, as <lb/>
            the lovers of pleasure think who calumniate them and cover <lb/>
            them with ridicule. And do not form a positive judgment in <lb/>
            your own mind either as to the appearance of the matter, or <lb/>
            as to the soundness of condition enjoyed by those who practise <lb/>
            these things, before you have reported the matter to and laid <lb/>
            it before the father; for the opinions of those who have only <lb/>
            lately begun to learn are unstable and without any firm foun­ <lb/>
            dation ; but the sentiment of those who have made some <lb/>
            advance are solid, and from their opinions they must of neces­ <lb/>
            sity derive firmness and steadiness.</p>
          <p>V. Therefore, 0 my mind, if you in this manner investigate <lb/>
            the holy thoughts of God with which man is inspired by divine <lb/>
            agency and the laws of such men as love God, you will not be <lb/>
            compelled to admit any thing lowly, anything unworthy, of <lb/>
            their greatness. For how could any man who is endowed <lb/>
            with sound sense and wisdom, receive this very thing concern­ <lb/>
            ing which our present discussion now is ? Can any one believe <lb/>
            that there was such a great want of servants and attendants in <lb/>
            the household of Jacob who was possessed of treasures equal <lb/>
            to those of a king, that it was necessary for him to send his <lb/>
            soil away to a distant country to bring him word of the health <lb/>
            of his other children and of his flocks? His grandfather, <lb/>
            besides the multitude of captives whom he had carried off when <lb/>
            he defeated the nine kings, had more than three hundred <lb/>
            domestic servants, and all this household had suffered no <lb/>
            diminution, but rather, as time advanced, all his wealth had <lb/>
            received great increase in all its parts.</p>
          <p>Would he not then, when he had an abundance of servants <lb/>
            of all kinds ready to his hand, have preferred sending one of <lb/>
             <pb n="245"/>
            them, to sending his son, whom he loved above all things, on <lb/>
            a business which any one of the lowest of his servants could <lb/>
            easily have brought to a successful issue ?</p>
          <p>VI. But you see that he here gives a superfluously minute <lb/>
            description of the country from which he sends him forth, in a <lb/>
            way which all but commands us to forsake the strict letter of <lb/>
            what is written. " For out of the valley of Chebron," now the <lb/>
            name Chebron, when interpreted, means conjoined and associ­ <lb/>
            ated, being a figurative way of intimating our body which is <lb/>
            conjoined and which is associated in a sort of companionship <lb/>
            and friendship with the soul. Moreover, the organs of the <lb/>
            outward senses have valleys, great ducts to receive everything <lb/>
            external which is an object of the outward senses, which collect <lb/>
            together an infinite number of distinctive qualities, and by <lb/>
            means of those ducts pour them in upon the mind, and wash it <lb/>
            out, and bring it in the depths. On this account, in the law <lb/>
            concerning leprosy, it is expressly ordered, " when in any house <lb/>
            hollows appear of a pale or fiery red colour, that the inhabi­ <lb/>
            tants shall take out the stones in which such hollows appear, <lb/>
            and put in other stones in their places " that is to say, when <lb/>
            different distinctive qualities which the pleasures and the appe­ <lb/>
            tites, and the passions akin to them, have wrought in men, <lb/>
            weighing down and oppressing the whole soul, have made it <lb/>
            more hollow and more lowly than its natural condition would <lb/>
            be, it is well to remove the reasons which are the cause of this <lb/>
            weakness, and to bring in such in their stead as are sound by <lb/>
            a legitimate style of education and a healthy kind of discipline.</p>
          <p>VII. Seeing therefore that Joseph has wholly entered into the <lb/>
            hollow valleys of the body and of the outward senses, he invites <lb/>
            him to come forth out of his holes, and to bring forward the <lb/>
            free air of perseverance, going as a pupil to those who were <lb/>
            formerly practisers of it themselves, and who are now become <lb/>
            teachers of it; but he who appears to himself to have made pro­ <lb/>
            gress in this, is found to be in error; "For a man," says the <lb/>
            holy scripture, " found him wandering in the plain,"t showing <lb/>
            that it is not labour by itself, intrinsically considered, but labour <lb/>
            with skill, that is good. For as it is of no use to study music <lb/>
            in an unmusical manner, nor grammar without any attention <lb/>
            to its true principles, nor, in short, any art whatever in a manner <lb/>
            either devoid of art or proceeding on false rules of art, but <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xiv. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxvii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="246"/>
            each art must be cultivated on a strict obedience to its rules ; <lb/>
            so also it is of no avail to apply one's self to the study of wisdom <lb/>
            in a crafty spirit, or to the study of temperance in a nig­ <lb/>
            gardly and illiberal frame of mind, nor to courage rashly, nor to <lb/>
            piety superstitiously, nor, in fact, to any other science which <lb/>
            is in accordance with virtue in an unscientific manner. For <lb/>
            all these steps are confessedly erroneous. In reference to <lb/>
            which, a law has been delivered to us "to pursue what is just <lb/>
            in a just manner,"* that we may cultivate justice and every <lb/>
            other virtue by those works which are akin to it, and not by <lb/>
            those which are contrary to it.</p>
          <p>If, therefore, you see any one desiring meat or drink at an <lb/>
            unseasonable time, or repudiating baths or ointments at the <lb/>
            proper season, or neglecting the proper clothing for his body, <lb/>
            or lying on the ground and sleeping in the open air, and by <lb/>
            such conduct as this, pretending to a character for temperance <lb/>
            and self-denial, you, pitying his self-deception, should show him <lb/>
            the true path of temperance, for all the practices in which he <lb/>
            has been indulging are useless and profitless labours, oppress­ <lb/>
            ing both his soul and body with hunger and all sorts of other <lb/>
            hardships.</p>
          <p>Nor if anyone, using washings and purifications, soils his <lb/>
            mind, but makes his bodily appearance brilliant; nor if again <lb/>
            out of his abundant wealth he builds a temple with brilliant <lb/>
            a artments of all kinds, at a vast expense; nor if he offers up <lb/>
            h catombs and never ceases sacrificing oxen ; nor if he adorns <lb/>
            temples with costly offerings, bringing timber in abundance, <lb/>
            and skilful ornaments, more valuable than any of gold or <lb/>
            silver, still let him not be classed among pious men, for he <lb/>
            also has wandered out of the way to piety, looking upon cere­ <lb/>
            monious worship as equivalent to sanctity, and giving gifts to <lb/>
            the incorruptible being who will never receive such offerings, <lb/>
            and flattering him who can never listen to flattery, who loves <lb/>
            genuine worship (and genuine worship is that of the soul <lb/>
            which offers the only sacrifice, plain truth), and rejects all <lb/>
            spurious ministrations, and those are spurious which are only <lb/>
            displays of external riches and extravagance.</p>
          <p>VIII. But some say that the proper name of the man who <lb/>
            found him wandering in the plain is not mentioned, and they <lb/>
            themselves are in some degree mistaken here, because they are <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xvi. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="247"/>
            unable clearly to discover the true way of this business, for if <lb/>
            they had not been mutilated as to the eye of the soul, they <lb/>
            would have known that of one who is truly a man, the most <lb/>
            proper, and appropriate, and felicitous name is this very name <lb/>
            of man, being the most appropriate appellation of a well <lb/>
            regulated and rational mind. This man, dwelling in the soul <lb/>
            of each individual, is found at one time to be a ruler and <lb/>
            monarch, and at another time to be a judge and umpire of the <lb/>
            contests which take place in life. At times also he takes the <lb/>
            place of a witness and accuser, and without being seen he <lb/>
            corrects us from within, not suffering us to open our mouths, <lb/>
            but taking up, and restraining, and bridling, with the reins of <lb/>
            conscience the self-satisfied and restive course of the tongue.</p>
          <p>This convicting feeling it is which inquires of the soul <lb/>
            when it sees it wandering about, What seekest thou? Is it <lb/>
            wisdom? why then do you go after wickedness? Or is it <lb/>
            temperance ? but this path of yours leads to niggardliness. <lb/>
            Or is courage ? by this path you will only arrive at rashness. <lb/>
            Or are you in pursuit of piety? this is the road to superstition. <lb/>
            But if it should say that it is seeking words of wisdom, and <lb/>
            that it is longing for them, as for what is nearest akin to its <lb/>
            own race, we must not give implicit belief to this, for the <lb/>
            question was not, Where are they feeding their flocks ? but <lb/>
            Where are they tending them? for they who feed their flocks <lb/>
            supply nourishment, and all the objects of the outward senses <lb/>
            to the animal of the outward senses devoid of reason and <lb/>
            insatiable; by means of which outward senses and their <lb/>
            indulgence, we become unable to govern ourselves and fall <lb/>
            into misfortune ; but they who tend their flocks, having the <lb/>
            power of rulers and governors, make those gentle which were <lb/>
            fierce before, checking the mighty power of the appetites. <lb/>
            If, therefore, he was in all sincerity seeking the practices of <lb/>
            virtue, he would have sought for them among kings, and not <lb/>
            among cup-bearers, or cooks, or confectioners, for these last <lb/>
            prepare things which have reference to pleasure, but the <lb/>
            former are masters of pleasure.</p>
          <p>IX. Therefore the man, who saw the deceit, answered <lb/>
            rightly, " They are departed hence." And he shows here the <lb/>
            mass of the body; clearly proving that all those by whom <lb/>
            labour is practised for the sake of the acquisition of virtue, <lb/>
            having left the regions of earth, have determined on contem­ <lb/>
             <pb n="248"/>
            plating only what is sublime, dragging with them no stain of <lb/>
            the body. For he says, too, that he had heard them say, " Let <lb/>
            us go to Dotham:" and the name Dotham, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means " a sufficient leaving ;" showing that it was with no <lb/>
            moderate resolution, but with extreme determination that <lb/>
            they had decided on leaving and abandoning all those <lb/>
            things which do not co-operate towards virtue, just as the <lb/>
            customs of women had ceased any longer to affect Sarah. But <lb/>
            the passions are female by nature, and we must study to quit <lb/>
            them, showing our preference for the masculine characters of <lb/>
            the good dispositions.</p>
          <p>Therefore the interpreter of divers opinions, the wandering <lb/>
            Joseph, is found in the plain, that is to say, in a contention <lb/>
            of words, having reference to political considerations rather <lb/>
            than to useful truth ; but there are some adversaries who, by <lb/>
            reason of their vigorous body, their antagonists having suc­ <lb/>
            cumbed, have gained the prize of victory without a struggle, <lb/>
            not having even had,to descend into the arena to contend for it, <lb/>
            but obtaining the chief honours on account of their incom­ <lb/>
            parable strength. Using such a power as this with reference <lb/>
            to the most divine thing that is in us, namely, our mind, <lb/>
            " Isaac goes forth into the plain ;"* not for the purpose of <lb/>
            contending with any body, since all those who might have <lb/>
            been his antagonists, are terrified at the greatness and exceed­ <lb/>
            ing excellence of his nature in all things ; but only wishing to <lb/>
            meet in private, and to converse in private with the fellow <lb/>
            traveller and guide of his path and of his soul, namely God. <lb/>
            And the clearest possible proof of this is, that no one who <lb/>
            conversed with Isaac was a mere mortal. Rebecca, that is <lb/>
            perseverance, asks her servant, seeing but one person, and <lb/>
            having no conception but of one only, " Who is this man who <lb/>
            is coming to meet us ?" For the soul which perseveres in what <lb/>
            is good, is able to comprehend all self-taught wisdom, which <lb/>
            is named Isaac, but is not yet able to see God, who is the <lb/>
            guide of wisdom. Therefore, also, the servant confirming the <lb/>
            fact that he cannot be comprehended who is invisible, and who <lb/>
            converses with man invisibly, says, " He is my lord," pointing <lb/>
            to Isaac alone. For it is not natural that, if two persons were <lb/>
            in sight, he should point to one alone; but the person whom <note type="footnote"> it Genesis xxiv. 63. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="249"/>
            he did not point to, he did not see, inasmuch as he was <lb/>
            invisible to all persons of intermediate character.</p>
          <p>X. Now I think that it has already been sufficiently shown, <lb/>
            that the field to which Cain invites Abel to come, is a symbol <lb/>
            of strife and contention. And we must now proceed to raise <lb/>
            the question what the matters are concerning which, when they <lb/>
            have arrived in the plain, they are about to institute an inves­ <lb/>
            tigation. It is surely plain that they are opposite and rival <lb/>
            opinions : for Abel, who refers everything to God, is the God- <lb/>
            loving opinion; and Cain, who refers everything to himself <lb/>
            (for his name, being interpreted, means acquisition), is the <lb/>
            self-loving opinion. And men are self-loving when, having <lb/>
            stripped and gone into the arena with those who honour virtue, <lb/>
            they never cease struggling against them with every kind of <lb/>
            weapon, till they compel them to succumb, or else utterly <lb/>
            destroy them ; for, as the proverb is, they leave no stone <lb/>
            unturned, saying, Is not the body the house of the soul ? Why, <lb/>
            then, should we not take care of the house that it may not <lb/>
            become ruinous? Are not the eyes and the ears, and all the <lb/>
            company of the other outward senses, guards, as it were, and <lb/>
            friends of the soul ? Ought we not, then, to honour men's <lb/>
            friends and allies equally with themselves ? And has nature <lb/>
            made pleasures and enjoyments, and all the delights which <lb/>
            are spread over the whole of life for the dead, or for those who <lb/>
            have never even had any existence at all, and not rather for <lb/>
            those who are alive ? And what ought we not to do to pro­ <lb/>
            cure for ourselves riches, and glory, and honours, and authority, <lb/>
            and all other things of that sort, which are the only means of <lb/>
            living not only safely, but happily ? And the life of these men <lb/>
            is a proof of this. For they who are called lovers of virtue are <lb/>
            nearly all of them men inglorious, easily to be despised, lowly, <lb/>
            in need of necessary things, more dishonourable than subjects, <lb/>
            or even than slaves, sordid, pale, cadaverous-looking, bearing <lb/>
            want and hunger in their countenances, full of diseases, men <lb/>
            who would be glad to die. But those who take care of them­ <lb/>
            selves are men of reputation, rich, leaders, men in the enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of praise and honour; moreover, they are healthy, stout, <lb/>
            and vigorous ; living delicately, nursed in luxury, strangers to <lb/>
            labour, living in the constant company of pleasure, and using <lb/>
            all their outward senses to bring delights to the soul, which is <lb/>
            capable of receiving them all.</p><pb n="250"/>
            
          <p>XI. Arguing therefore in this prolix train of reasoning, they <lb/>
            thought that they got the better of those who were not accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to deal in sophistry. But the cause of their victory <lb/>
            was not the strength of those who got the better, but the <lb/>
            weakness of their adversaries in these matters. For of those <lb/>
            who practise virtue, some treasured up what is good in their <lb/>
            soul alone, becoming practisers of praiseworthy actions, and <lb/>
            having no knowledge whatever of sophistries of words. But <lb/>
            they who were armed in both ways, having their minds fur­ <lb/>
            nished with wise counsel and with good deeds, and having also <lb/>
            good store of reasons to bring forward according to the arts <lb/>
            of the sophists, they had a good right to oppose the contentious <lb/>
            behaviour of some others, having means at hand by which to <lb/>
            repel their enemies. But the former sort had no safety what­ <lb/>
            ever. For what men could fight naked against armed <lb/>
            enemies on equal terms, when, even if they had been both <lb/>
            equally armed, the contest would still have been unequal ?</p>
          <p>Abel therefore had not learnt any of the arts of reasoning, <lb/>
            but he knew what was good by his intellectual disposition <lb/>
            alone ; on account of which he ought to have refused to go <lb/>
            down to the plain, and to have disregarded the invitation of his <lb/>
            enemy. For any display of fear is better than being defeated ; <lb/>
            but such fear a man's enemies call cowardice, but his friends <lb/>
            entitle it safe prudence, and we must believe friends in pre­ <lb/>
            ference to enemies, inasmuch as they tell us the truth.</p>
          <p>XII. And it is on this account, as you see, that Moses <lb/>
            rejected the sophists in Egypt, that is to say, in the body <lb/>
            whom he calls magicians (for it is owing to the tricks and <lb/>
            deceits of their sophistical tricks that good dispositions and <lb/>
            good habits are infected and corrupted), saying that he was <lb/>
            '' not an eloquent man,"* which is equivalent to saying that <lb/>
            he was not formed by nature for the conjectural rhetoric of <lb/>
            plausible and specious reasons. And immediately afterwards <lb/>
            he confirms the assertion by adding, that he is not only not <lb/>
            eloquent, but altogether " void of words, "t meaning this, not <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> + It is not possible to give the exact force of the original here. The <lb/>
            Greek word is <foreign xml:lang="grc">ᾶλογος</foreign>, which usually means "irrational," as derived from <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">λ</foreign>óy<foreign xml:lang="grc">ος</foreign>, " reason " which word has also the sense of " a word," " speech." <lb/>
            The bible translation in the passage alluded to, Exodus vi. 12, is "who <lb/>
            am of uncircumcised lips." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="251"/>
            in the sense in which we do when we call animals void of <lb/>
            words, but speaking of himself as one who did not choose to <lb/>
            employ words by means of his organs of speech, but who <lb/>
            impresses and stamps the principles of true wisdom upon his <lb/>
            mind alone, which is the most perfect opposite to false sophis­ <lb/>
            try. And he will not go to Egypt, nor will he descend into <lb/>
            the arena to strive against the sophists who contend in it, till <lb/>
            be has thoroughly studied and practised the art of argumen­ <lb/>
            tative reasoning ; God himself showing to him all the ideas <lb/>
            which belong to such elocution, and making him perfect in <lb/>
            them by the election of Aaron who was the brother of Moses, <lb/>
            and whom he was accustomed to call his mouth-piece, and <lb/>
            interpreter, and prophet.* For all these attributes belong to <lb/>
            speech, which is the brother of the intellect; for the intellect is <lb/>
            the fountain of words, and speech is its mouth-piece, because <lb/>
            all the conceptions which are entertained in the mind are <lb/>
            poured forth by means of speech, like streams of water which <lb/>
            flow out of the earth, and come into sight. And speech is <lb/>
            an interpreter of the things which the mind has decided upon <lb/>
            in its tribunal. Moreover, it is a prophet and a soothsayer <lb/>
            of those things which the mind unceasingly pours forth as <lb/>
            oracles from its inaccessible and invisible retreats.</p>
          <p>XIII. In this manner, then, it is useful to oppose those <lb/>
            who are ostentatious about doctrines. For if we have been <lb/>
            well exercised in various species of discourses, we shall no <lb/>
            longer stumble through inexperience and want of acquaintance <lb/>
            with the manoeuvres of sophists. But rising up and making <lb/>
            a firm and resolute stand against them, we shall with ease <lb/>
            escape from their artificial entanglements. But they, when their <lb/>
            tricks have once been found out, will appear to be exhibiting <lb/>
            the conduct of sparrers rather than of regular combatants. <lb/>
            For they too, in their own opinion, get great credit by their <lb/>
            style of beating the air; but when they come to a real contest <lb/>
            they meet with no moderate disgrace. And if any one is <lb/>
            adorned as to his soul with all imaginable virtues, and yet <lb/>
            has paid no attention to the art of speaking and arguing, if <lb/>
            he only preserves silence he will obtain safety, a prize won <lb/>
            without danger. But if he comes forth like Abel into a <lb/>
            contest with sophists, he will be thrown down before he has <lb/>
            obtained a firm footing. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus vii. 1. </note> <pb n="252"/>
            </p>
          <p>For, as in medical science, some practitioners who know how <lb/>
            to cure almost every complaint, and disease, and infirmity, can <lb/>
            nevertheless give no true or even probable account of any one <lb/>
            of them; and on the other hand, others are very clever, as far <lb/>
            as giving an account of the diseases goes, and in explaining <lb/>
            their symptons and causes, and the modes of cure, and are the <lb/>
            most excellent interpreters possible of the principles of which <lb/>
            their art is made up, but are utterly useless in the matter of <lb/>
            attending the bodies of the sick, to the cure of which they are <lb/>
            not able to contribute even the slightest assistance. In the same <lb/>
            way, those who have devoted themselves to practical wisdom <lb/>
            have often neglected to pay attention to their language; and <lb/>
            those who have learnt their professions thoroughly as far as <lb/>
            words go, have yet treasured up no good instruction in their <lb/>
            soul. It is therefore nothing extraordinary, that these men <lb/>
            being in the habit of indulging an unbridled tongue, should be <lb/>
            full of self-sufficiency and boldness, displaying all the folly <lb/>
            which they have from the first beginning cherished. But it is <lb/>
            better to trust to those who, like skilful physicians, have a <lb/>
            knowledge of the means of healing the diseases and evil af­ <lb/>
            fections of the soul, until God provides an excellent interpreter, <lb/>
            and displays to and pours upon him the fountains of his elo­ <lb/>
            quence.</p>
          <p>XIV. It would therefore have been consistent for Abel to <lb/>
            practise prudence, a very saving virtue, and to have remained <lb/>
            at home, disregarding the invitation to the arena of discus­ <lb/>
            sion and contest, which was given to him, imitating Rebecca, <lb/>
            that is perseverance, who, when Esau, the companion of <lb/>
            wickedness, was pouring forth threats, advised the practiser of <lb/>
            wisdom, Jacob, to retreat before him who was about to plot <lb/>
            against him, until he should have relaxed in his fierce hostility <lb/>
            to him, for Esau had been holding out an intolerable threat over <lb/>
            Jacob, saying, " The days of mourning for my Father are at <lb/>
            hand, that then I may slay my brother Jacob;"* for he is <lb/>
            wishing only that that species in the nature of things which is <lb/>
            void of passions, namely, Isaac (to whom the oracle had been <lb/>
            given, that he should not descend into Egypt),t may be the <lb/>
            victim of an irrational affection, in order I suppose that he <lb/>
            may be wounded by the stings of pleasure or pain, or of any <lb/>
            other passion, showing that the man who is not wholly perfect <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 41. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="253"/>
             <lb/>
            and who makes laborious improvements, will receive not merely <lb/>
            a wound, but utter destruction. However, the good God will <lb/>
            neither allow that invulnerable species among created things to <lb/>
            be subdued by passion, nor will he surrender the practice of <lb/>
            virtue to bloody and raging destruction.</p>
          <p>On which account we read in a subsequent passage, " Cain <lb/>
            rose up against Abel, his brother, and slew him." * For ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the first imagination, he suggests the idea that Abel <lb/>
            has been killed. But if you look at it according to the most <lb/>
            accurate investigation, you will see that he intimates that <lb/>
            Cain himself was slain by himself, so that we ought to read <lb/>
            it thus : " Cain rose up and killed himself," and not the other. <lb/>
            And very reasonably may we attribute this to him. For the <lb/>
            soul, which destroys out of itself the virtue-loving and God- <lb/>
            loving principle, has died as to the life of virtue, so that Abel <lb/>
            (which appears a most paradoxical assertion) both is dead and <lb/>
            alive. He is dead, indeed, having been slain by the foolish <lb/>
            mind, but he lives according to the happy life which is in God. <lb/>
            And the holy oracle which has been given will bear witness, <lb/>
            which expressly says, that he cried out loudly, and betrayed <lb/>
            clearly by his cries t what he had suffered from the concrete <lb/>
            evil, that is from the body. For how could one who no longer <lb/>
            existed have conversed ?</p>
          <p>XV. The wise man, therefore, who appears to have de­ <lb/>
            parted from this mortal life, lives according to the immortal <lb/>
            life ; but the wicked man who lives in wickedness has died ac­ <lb/>
            cording to the happy life. For in the various animals of <lb/>
            different kinds, and in general in all bodies, it is both possible <lb/>
            and easy to conceive, that the agents are of one kind, and the <lb/>
            patients of another. For when a father beats his son, cor­ <lb/>
            rectine, him, or when a teacher beats his pupil, he who beats is <lb/>
            one, and he who is beaten is another. But in the case of <lb/>
            these beings, which are united and made one, only in the part <lb/>
            as to which both acting and suffering are found to exist; these <lb/>
            two things are there, neither at different times, nor do they <lb/>
            affect different people, but they affect the same person in the <lb/>
            same manner at the same time.</p>
          <p>At all events, when an athlete rubs himself for the sake of <lb/>
            taking exercise, he is by all means rubbed also; and, if any <lb/>
            one strikes himself, he himself is struck and wounded; and so <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="254"/>
            also lie who mutilates or kills himself as the agent, is mutilated <lb/>
            or killed as the patient. Why, then, do I say this ? Because <lb/>
            it appears inevitable that the soul, inasmuch as it consists not <lb/>
            of particles which are separated but of those which are united, <lb/>
            should suffer what it appears to do, as in real truth it did in <lb/>
            this instance; for, when it appeared to be destroying the God- <lb/>
            loving doctrine, it destroyed itself. And Lamech is a witness <lb/>
            to this, the descendant of the impiety of Cain, who says to his <lb/>
            wives, who are the representatives of two inconsiderate opinions, <lb/>
            " I have slain a man to my hurt, and a young man to be a <lb/>
            scar to me."* For it is evident that if any one slays the prin­ <lb/>
            ciple of courage, he wounds himself with the opposite disease <lb/>
            v of cowardice; and if any one in the practice of honourable <lb/>
            studies slays his vigorous strength, he is inflicting on himself <lb/>
            wounds and great injuries with no moderate degree of disgrace. <lb/>
            Therefore, indeed, perseverance says that if practice and im­ <lb/>
            provement be destroyed she will lose not only one child but <lb/>
            also her others also, and be an instance of complete childless­ <lb/>
            ness.</p>
          <p>XVI. But as he who injures a good man is proved to be <lb/>
            doing injury to himself, so also does he who thinks his betters <lb/>
            worthy of privileges, in word indeed claim advantage for them, <lb/>
            but in fact he is procuring it for himself. And nature here <lb/>
            bears testimony in support of my argument, and so do all the <lb/>
            laws which have been established in consistency with her; for <lb/>
            there is a positive and express and intelligible command laid <lb/>
            down in these words : " Honour thy father and thy mother, that <lb/>
            it may be well with thee ;"t not well with those who receive <lb/>
            the honour, says the Scripture, but with thee; for if we look <lb/>
            upon the intellect as the father of this concrete animal, and if <lb/>
            we honour the outward senses as its mother, we ourselves shall <lb/>
            be well treated by them. But the proper honour to be paid to <lb/>
            the mind is first to be honoured on account of what is useful, <lb/>
            and not on account of what is pleasant; but all things proceed­ <lb/>
            ing from virtue are useful. And the honour proper to be paid <lb/>
            to the outward sense is when we do not allow ourselves to be <lb/>
            carried away by its impetuosity towards the external objects of <lb/>
            the outward senses, but compel it to be curved by the mind, <lb/>
            which knows how to govern and guide the irrational powers in <lb/>
            us. If, therefore, each of these things, the outward sense and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 45. </note> <note type="footnote"> ++ Exodus xx. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="255"/>
            the mind, receive the honour which I have been describing, <lb/>
            then it follows'of necessity that I, who use them both, must de­ <lb/>
            rive advantage from them. But if, carrying your language away <lb/>
            a long distance from the mind and from the outward sense, you <lb/>
            think your father, that is to say, the world which produced you, <lb/>
            and your mother, wisdom, by means of which the universe was <lb/>
            completed, worthy of honour, you yourself shall be well treated; <lb/>
            for neither does God, who is full of everything, nor sublime <lb/>
            and perfect knowledge, want anything. So that he who is in­ <lb/>
            clined to pay proper attention to them, benefits not those who <lb/>
            receive his attentions and who are in no need of anything, <lb/>
            but himself most exceedingly. For skill in horsemanship and <lb/>
            in judging of dogs, being in reality a ministering to horses and <lb/>
            dogs, supplies those animals with the useful things of which <lb/>
            each species is in need ; and if it were not so to supply them it <lb/>
            would seem to neglect them. But it is not proper to call <lb/>
            piety, which consists in ministering to God, a virtue which is <lb/>
            conversant about supplying the things which will be of use to <lb/>
            the Deity; for the Deity is not benefited by any one, inas­ <lb/>
            much as he is not in need of anything, nor is it in the power of <lb/>
            any one to benefit a being who is in every particular superior <lb/>
            to himself. But, on the contrary, God himself is continually <lb/>
            and unceasingly benefiting all things.</p>
          <p>So, when we say that piety is a ministering to God, we say <lb/>
            that it is in some such a service as slaves discharge to their <lb/>
            masters, who are taught to do without, hesitation that which is <lb/>
            commanded them; but, again, there will be a difference, <lb/>
            because the masters are in need of service, but God has no <lb/>
            such want. So that, in the case of the masters, the servants <lb/>
            do supply that which will be of use to them, but to God they <lb/>
            supply nothing beyond a mind imbued with a spirit of willing <lb/>
            obedience; for they will not find anything which they can im­ <lb/>
            prove, since all things belonging to masters are, from the very <lb/>
            beginning, most excellent ; but they will benefit themselves <lb/>
            very greatly by determining to become friends to God.</p>
          <p>XVII. I think, therefore, that enough has been now said <lb/>
            with respect to those who appear to think that they do others <lb/>
            good or harm. For it has been shown, that that which they <lb/>
            think that they are doing to others, they in either case do to <lb/>
            themselves. We will now examine the remainder of this <lb/>
            event; the question is as follows:-" Where is Abel, thy <lb/>
             <pb n="256"/>
            brother?"* To which answer is made, "I do not know; am <lb/>
            I my brother's keeper?" It is therefore worth while to con­ <lb/>
            sider the question whether it can be appropriately said of God <lb/>
            that he asks a question. For he who asks a question or puts <lb/>
            an inquiry is asking or inquiring about something of which <lb/>
            he is ignorant; seeking an answer through which he will know <lb/>
            what he as yet does not know. But everything is known to <lb/>
            God, not only all that is present, and all that is past, but also <lb/>
            all that is to come. What need, then, has he of an answer <lb/>
            which cannot give any additional knowledge to the questioner? <lb/>
            But we must say that such things cannot properly be uttered <lb/>
            by the Cause of all things, but that, as it is possible to say <lb/>
            what is not true without lying, so it is possible for one to put <lb/>
            a question or an interrogatory without either making inquiry <lb/>
            or seeking for information. " Why, then," some one will say, <lb/>
            " are such words spoken ?" In order that the soul which is <lb/>
            about to give the answer may prove by itself what it answers <lb/>
            correctly or incorrectly, having no one else either as an accuser <lb/>
            or an adversary.</p>
          <p>Since, when he asks the wise man, Where is virtue ?t that <lb/>
            is to say, when he asks Abraham, about Sarah, he asks, not <lb/>
            because he is ignorant, but because he thinks that he ought to <lb/>
            answer for the sake of eliciting praise from the answer of him <lb/>
            who speaks. Accordingly, Moses tells us that Abraham <lb/>
            answered, " Behold, she is in the tent ;" that is to say, in the <lb/>
            soul. What then is there in this answer that contains praise ? <lb/>
            Behold, says he, I keep virtue in my house as a treasure <lb/>
            carefully stored up, and on account of this I am immediately <lb/>
            happy. For it is the use and enjoyment of virtue that is <lb/>
            happiness, and not the bare possession of it. But I should <lb/>
            not be able to use it unless you, by letting down the seeds <lb/>
            from heaven, had yourself made virtue pregnant; and unless <lb/>
            she had brought forth the germs of happiness, namely, Isaac. <lb/>
            And I consider that happiness is the employment of perfect <lb/>
            virtue in a perfect life. In reference to which he, approving <lb/>
            of his own determination, promises that he will complete <lb/>
            perfectly all that he asked.</p>
          <p>XVIII. To him therefore the answer brought praise, as he <lb/>
            confessed that virtue without the divine favour was not <lb/>
            sufficient of itself to help any one ; and, in consequence, it <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xviii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="257"/>
            also brings blame to Cain, who says that he does not know <lb/>
            where he is who has been treacherously slain by him. For he <lb/>
            appears by this answer to be wishing to deceive his hearer, as <lb/>
            one who does not see everything, and who has no previous <lb/>
            suspicion of the deceit which he is about to use. But every <lb/>
            one is wicked and worthy of proscription who thinks that the <lb/>
            eye of God can ever fail to see anything. But Cain here <lb/>
            speaks arrogantly, "Am I my brother's keeper?" For we <lb/>
            might altogether say he was sure hereafter to lead a miser­ <lb/>
            able life, if nature made you the guardian and keeper of so <lb/>
            good a man. Do you not see that the lawgiver entrusts the <lb/>
            keeping and preservation of the holy things not to any chance <lb/>
            person, but to the Levites, who were the most holy persons <lb/>
            in their opinions ? for whom the earth and the air and the <lb/>
            water were considered an unworthy inheritance, but the heaven <lb/>
            and the whole world were looked upon as their due. And <lb/>
            the Creator alone is worthy of these things, to whom they <lb/>
            have fled for refuge, becoming his sincere suppliants and <lb/>
            servants, showing their love for their master in their continued <lb/>
            service, and in the unhesitating observance of all the com­ <lb/>
            mands which are laid upon them, and in the preservation of <lb/>
            the things entrusted to them.</p>
          <p>XIX. And it has not fallen to the lot of all the suppliants <lb/>
            to become guardians of the holy things, but to those only who <lb/>
            have arrived at the number fifty, which proclaims remission of <lb/>
            offences and perfect liberty, and a return to their ancient pos­ <lb/>
            sessions. "For this," says the Scripture, "is the law concerning <lb/>
            the Levites : from twenty-five years old and upwards, they <lb/>
            shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the <lb/>
            congregation: and from the age of fifty years they shall cease <lb/>
            waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more; but <lb/>
            shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the con. <lb/>
            gregation, and they shall keep what is to be kept, and shall do <lb/>
            no service."* Therefore, the Scripture charges him who has <lb/>
            half perfection (for the number fifty is perfect, and the number <lb/>
            twenty-five is the half of fifty), to work and to do what is holy, <lb/>
            approving his ministration by his works. And the beginning, <lb/>
            as an old writer has said, is half of the whole. But the <lb/>
            perfect man it does not enjoin to labour any longer, but only <lb/>
            to preserve what he has acquired by labour and diligence. For <note type="footnote"> * Numbers viii. 24. </note> <note type="footnote"> s </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="258"/>
            may I never become a practiser of what I ought not to be a <lb/>
            preserver; subsequently practice therefore is mediocrity not <lb/>
            perfection, for it takes place not in perfect souls, but in such <lb/>
            as are seeking after perfection. But it is the perfect duty of <lb/>
            guardianship to deliver to memory the well-practised con­ <lb/>
            templations of holy things, the excellent deposit of knowledge <lb/>
            to a faithful guardian, who is the only one who disregards the <lb/>
            ingenious and manifold nets of forgetfulness; so that the <lb/>
            Scripture, with great propriety and felicity, calls him who is <lb/>
            mindful of what he has learnt, the guardian of it. And such <lb/>
            an one before he practised was a pupil, having another to teach <lb/>
            him; but when he became competent himself to guard what <lb/>
            he had learnt, he then received the power and rank of a <lb/>
            teacher, having appointed his brother, his own uttered dis­ <lb/>
            course, to the ministration of teaching.</p>
          <p>For it is said that, " His brother shall minister;" * so that <lb/>
            the mind of the good man is the guardian and steward of the <lb/>
            doctrines of virtue. But his brother, that is to say, uttered <lb/>
            discourse, shall minister instead of him, going through all the <lb/>
            doctrines and speculations of wisdom to those who are desirous <lb/>
            of instruction. On which account Moses, also, in his praises <lb/>
            of Levi, having previously said many admirable things, adds <lb/>
            subsequently, " He has guarded thy oracles and kept thy cove­ <lb/>
            nant." t And presently he continues, " They shall show thy <lb/>
            justification to Jacob, and thy law to Israel. Therefore, he <lb/>
            here clearly asserts that the good man is the guardian of the <lb/>
            words and of the covenant of God. And, indeed, in another <lb/>
            place he has shown that he is the best interpreter and declarer <lb/>
            of his justifications and laws; the faculty of interpretation <lb/>
            being displayed through its kindred organ-the voice, and <lb/>
            guardianship being exerted through the mind, which having <lb/>
            been made by nature as a great storehouse, easily contains the <lb/>
            conceptions of all things, whether bodies or things. It would <lb/>
            therefore have been worth the while of this self-loving Cain to <lb/>
            have been the keeper of Abel; for if he had kept him he <lb/>
            would have attained to a compounded and moderate kind of life, <note type="footnote"> *In quoting this passage above, I used the translation as given in <lb/>
            the bible, they " shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle;" <lb/>
            but the Greek of the text was the same in that passage as it is here. </note><note type="footnote"> + Deuteronomy xxxiii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="259"/>
            and would not have been filled with unmodified and absolute <lb/>
            wickedness.</p>
          <p>XX. And God said, " What hast thou done ? The voice or <lb/>
            the blood of thy brother cries out to me from out of the <lb/>
            ground."* The expression, " What hast thou done," shows in­ <lb/>
            dignation at an unhallowed action, and also ridicules the man <lb/>
            who thought he had committed the murder secretly. The in­ <lb/>
            dignation now arises at the intention of the man who has done <lb/>
            the deed, because he designed to destroy what was good ; but <lb/>
            the ridicule is excited by his thinking that he has plotted <lb/>
            against one who is better than himself, and at his having <lb/>
            plotted not so much against him as against himself. For, as <lb/>
            I have said before, he who appears to be dead is alive, inasmuch <lb/>
            as lie is found to be a suppliant of God and to utter a voice; <lb/>
            and he who believes that he is still alive is dead, as to the death <lb/>
            of the soul, inasmuch as he is excluded from virtue, according <lb/>
            to which alone he is worthy to live. So that the expression, <lb/>
            " What hast thou done?" is equivalent to, "Thou hast done <lb/>
            nothing; thou hast done no good for thyself."</p>
          <p>For neither was the sophist, Salaam, who was an empty mul­ <lb/>
            titude of contrary and contending doctrines, when he was <lb/>
            desirous to imprecate curses upon and to injure the good man, <lb/>
            able to do so; since God turned his curses into a blessing, in <lb/>
            order to correct the unjust man of wickedness and to display <lb/>
            his own love of virtue.</p>
          <p>XXI. But it is the nature of sophists to have for enemies <lb/>
            the faculties which are in them, while their language is at <lb/>
            variance with their thoughts and their thoughts with their lan­ <lb/>
            guage, and while neither is in the least degree consistent with the <lb/>
            other. At all events, they wear out our ears, arguing that justice <lb/>
            is a great bond of society, that temperance is a profitable thing, <lb/>
            that continence is a virtuous thing, that piety is a most useful <lb/>
            thing, and, of each other virtue, that it is a most wholesome and <lb/>
            saving quality. And, on the other hand, that injustice is a <lb/>
            quality with which we ought to have no truce, that intempe­ <lb/>
            rance is a diseased habit, that impiety is scandalous, and so <lb/>
            going through every kind of wickedness, that each sort is most <lb/>
            pernicious. And, nevertheless, they never cease showing by <lb/>
            their conduct that their real opinion is the reverse of their lan­ <lb/>
            guage. But, when they extol prudence and temperance and <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxiii. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> s 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="260"/>
            justice and piety, they then show that they are, above all <lb/>
            measure, foolish, and intemperate, and unjust, and impious ; in <lb/>
            short, that they are throwing into confusion and overturning <lb/>
            all divine and human regulations and principles. And to them, <lb/>
            therefore, one may very properly say what the divine oracle <lb/>
            said to Cain, " What is this that thou hast done ?" What good <lb/>
            have ye done yourselves ? What have all these discourses <lb/>
            about virtue profited your souls? In what particular of life, <lb/>
            whether small or great, have ye done well ? What ? Have <lb/>
            you not, on the contrary, contributed to advancing true <lb/>
            charges against yourselves ? because, by expressing your ap­ <lb/>
            proval of what is good, and philosophising as far as words go, <lb/>
            you have been excellent interpreters, but are nevertheless dis­ <lb/>
            covered to be men who both think and practise shameful <lb/>
            things. In fact, all good things are dead in your souls, these <lb/>
            evils having been there kindled ; and, on this account there is <lb/>
            no one of you who is really alive.</p>
          <p>For as, when some musician or grammarian is dead, the <lb/>
            music and grammar which existed in them dies with them, but <lb/>
            their ideas survive, and in a manner live as long as the world <lb/>
            itself endures; according to which the existing race of men, <lb/>
            and those who are to exist hereafter in continual succession, <lb/>
            will, to the end of time, become skilful in music and grammar. <lb/>
            Thus, also, if the prudence, or the temperance, or the 'courage, <lb/>
            or the justice, or, in short, if the wisdom of any kind existing <lb/>
            in any individual be destroyed, nevertheless the prudence <lb/>
            existing in the nature of the immortal universe will still be im­ <lb/>
            mortal ; and every virtue is erected like a pillar in imperish­ <lb/>
            able solidity, in accordance with which there are some good <lb/>
            people now, and there will be some hereafter. Unless, indeed, <lb/>
            we should say that the death of any individual man is the de­ <lb/>
            struction of humanity and of the human race, which, whether <lb/>
            we ought to call it a genus, or a species, or a conception, or what­ <lb/>
            ever else you please, those who are anxious about the investiga­ <lb/>
            tion of proper names may determine. One seal has often <lb/>
            stamped thousands upon thousands of impressions in infinite <lb/>
            number, and though at times all those impressions have been <lb/>
            effaced with the substances on which they were stamped, still <lb/>
            the seal itself has remained in its pristine condition without <lb/>
            being at all injured in its nature. Again, do we not think that <lb/>
            the virtues, even if all the characters which they have impressed <lb/>
             <pb n="261"/>
            upon the souls of those who have sought them should become <lb/>
            effaced by wicked living, or by any other cause, would never­ <lb/>
            theless preserve their own unadulterated and imperishable <lb/>
            nature ? Therefore, they who have not been duly initiated in <lb/>
            instruction, not knowing anything about the differences between <lb/>
            wholes and parts, or between genera and species, or about the <lb/>
            homonymies which are incidental to these things, mix up all <lb/>
            things together in a confused mass. On which account every <lb/>
            one who is a lover of self, by surname Cain, should learn that <lb/>
            he has destroyed the namesake of Abel, that is to say species, <lb/>
            individuality, the image made according to the model; not the <lb/>
            archetypal pattern, nor the genus, nor the idea, which he <lb/>
            thinks are destroyed together with animals, though, in fact, <lb/>
            they are indestructible.</p>
          <p>Let any one then say to him, reproving and ridiculing him, <lb/>
            What is this that thou hast done, 0 wretched man ? Does <lb/>
            not the God-loving opinion which you flatter yourself that you <lb/>
            have destroyed, live in the presence of God ? But it is of <lb/>
            yourself that you have become the murderer, by destroying <lb/>
            from out of its seat the only quality by which you could live in <lb/>
            a blameless manner.</p>
          <p>XXII. And what was said afterwards is uttered very beauti­ <lb/>
            fully, with reference either to the beauty of the interpretation of <lb/>
            which it is susceptible, or to the conception which may be dis­ <lb/>
            covered in it. " The voice of the blood of thy brother calls to <lb/>
            me from out of the earth." This now, which is a very sublime <lb/>
            expression if we regard the language in which it is couched, is <lb/>
            intelligible to all those who are not utterly uninitiated in elo­ <lb/>
            quence. But let us consider the ideas which are apparent in <lb/>
            it as well as we are able.</p>
          <p>And first of all, let us consider what is said about the blood ; <lb/>
            for in many places of the law as given by Moses, he pronounces <lb/>
            the blood to be the essence of the soul or of life, saying dis­ <lb/>
            tinctly, " For the life of all flesh is the blood thereof." * And <lb/>
            when the Creator of all living things first began to make man, after <lb/>
            the creation of the heaven and the earth, and all the things which <lb/>
            are between the two, Moses says, " And he breathed into his <lb/>
            face the breath of life, and man became a living soul," <lb/>
            showing again by this expression that it is the breath which <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xvii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="262"/>
            is the essence of the life. And, indeed, he is accustomed dili­ <lb/>
            gently to record all the suggestions and purposes of God from <lb/>
            the beginning, thinking it right to adopt his subsequent state­ <lb/>
            ments to aid to make them consistent with his first accounts. <lb/>
            Therefore, after he had previously stated the breath to be the <lb/>
            essence of the life, he would not subsequently have spoken of <lb/>
            the blood as occupying the most important place in the body, <lb/>
            unless he had been making a reference to some very neces­ <lb/>
            sary and comprehensive principle. What then are we to say ? <lb/>
            The truth is, that every one of us according to the nearest <lb/>
            estimation of numbers, is two persons, the animal and the man. <lb/>
            And each of these two has a cognate power in the faculties, <lb/>
            the seat of which is the soul assigned to it. To the one <lb/>
            portion is assigned the vivifying faculty according to which we <lb/>
            live; and to the other, the reasoning faculty in accordance with <lb/>
            which we are capable of reasoning. Therefore, even the <lb/>
            irrational animals partake of the vivifying power ; but of the <lb/>
            rational faculty, God—I will not say partakes, but is the <lb/>
            ruler, and that is the fountain of the most ancient Word.</p>
          <p>XXIII. Therefore, the faculty which is common to us with <lb/>
            the irrational animals, has blood for its essence. And it, <lb/>
            having flowed from the rational fountain, is spirit, not air in <lb/>
            motion, but rather a certain representation and character of the <lb/>
            divine faculty which Moses calls by its proper name an image, <lb/>
            showing by his language that God is the archetypal pattern of <lb/>
            rational nature, and that man is the imitation of him, and the <lb/>
            image formed after his model; not meaning by man that <lb/>
            animal of a double nature, but the most excellent species of the <lb/>
            soul which is called mind and reason.</p>
          <p>On this account, Moses represents God as calling the blood <lb/>
            the life of the flesh, though he is aware that the nature of the <lb/>
            flesh has no participation in intellect, but that it does partake <lb/>
            of life, as also does our whole body. And the soul of man he <lb/>
            names the spirit, meaning by the term man, not the compound <lb/>
            being, as I said before, but that Godlike creation by which we <lb/>
            reason, the roots of which he stretched to heaven, and fastened <lb/>
            it to the outermost rim of the circle of those bodies which we <lb/>
            call the fixed stars. For God made man, the only heavenly <lb/>
            plant of those which he placed upon the earth, fastening the <lb/>
            heads of the others in the mainland, for all of them bend their <lb/>
             <pb n="263"/>
            heads downwards * but the face of man he has exalted and <lb/>
            directed upwards, that it might have its food of a heavenly and <lb/>
            incorruptible nature, and not earthly and perishable. With a <lb/>
            view to which, he also rooted in the earth the foundations of our <lb/>
            body, removing the most insensible part of it as far as possible <lb/>
            from reason; and the outward senses, which are as it were the <lb/>
            body-guards of the mind, and the mind itself, he established <lb/>
            at a great distance from the earth, and from all things con­ <lb/>
            nected with it, and bound it with the periodical revolutions of <lb/>
            the air and of the heavens, which are imperishable.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Let us then no longer doubt, we who are the disciples <lb/>
            of Moses, how man conceived an idea of God who is destitute of <lb/>
            all figure, for he was taught the reason of this by the divine <lb/>
            oracle, and afterwards he explained it to us. And he spoke as <lb/>
            follows:—" He said that the Creator made no soul in any <lb/>
            body capable of seeing its Creator by its own intrinsic powers. <lb/>
            But having considered that the knowledge of the Creator and <lb/>
            the proper understanding of the work of Creation, would be of <lb/>
            great advantage to the creature (for such knowledge is the <lb/>
            boundary of happiness and blessedness), he breathed into him <lb/>
            from above something of his own divine nature. And his <lb/>
            divine nature stamped her own impression in an invisible <lb/>
            manner on the invisible soul, in order that even the earth <lb/>
            might not be destitute of the image of God. But the arche­ <lb/>
            typal pattern was so devoid of all figure, that its very image <lb/>
            was not visible, being indeed fabricated in accordance with the <lb/>
            model, and accordingly it received not mortal but immortal <lb/>
            conceptions. For how could a mortal nature at the same time <lb/>
            remain where it was and also emigrate? or how could it see what <lb/>
            was here and what was on the other side ? or how could it sail <lb/>
            round the white sea, and at the same time traverse the whole <lb/>
            earth to its furthest boundaries, and inspect the customs and <note type="footnote"> * This idea is the same as that which Ovid has expressed in the <lb/>
            beginning of the Metamorphoses- <lb/>
            Pronaque dum spectant animalia cœtera terram, <lb/>
            Os homini sublime dedit, cœlumque tueri <lb/>
            Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus. <lb/>
            Which may perhaps be translated- <lb/>
            And while all other creatures from their birth <lb/>
            With downcast eyes gaze on their kindred earth. <lb/>
            He bids man walk erect, and scan the heaven <lb/>
            From which he springs, to which his hopes are given. </note> <lb/>

            laws of the nations on all the affairs and bodies which are in <lb/>
            existence ?</p>
          <p>On separating them from the things of the earth, how could <lb/>
            it arrive at a contemplation of the sublimer things of the air <lb/>
            and its revolutions, and the peculiar character of its seasons, <lb/>
            and all the things which at the periodical changes of the <lb/>
            year are made anew. and, according to their usual habit, <lb/>
            brought to perfection? Or again, how could it fly through <lb/>
            the air from earth to heaven, and investigate the natures which <lb/>
            exist in heaven, and see of what nature they are, how they are <lb/>
            moved, what are the limits of their movements, of their be­ <lb/>
            ginning and of their end ; how they are adapted to one another <lb/>
            and to the universe according to the just principles of kindred ? <lb/>
            Is it easy to have an accurate comprehension of the different <lb/>
            arts and of the different branches of knowledge which bring ex­ <lb/>
            ternal things into shape, and which are concerned with the <lb/>
            affairs of the body and of the soul, with a view to the improve­ <lb/>
            ment of the two, and to understand ten thousand other things. <lb/>
            of which it is not easy to describe either the number or the <lb/>
            nature in language ? For of all the faculties which exist in <lb/>
            us, the mind alone, as being the most rapid in its motions of <lb/>
            all, appears to be able to outrun and to pass by the time in <lb/>
            which it originates, according to the invisible powers of the <lb/>
            universe and of its parts existing without any reference to <lb/>
            time, and touching the universe and its parts, and the causes of <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>And now, having gone not only to the very boundaries of <lb/>
            earth and sea, but also to those of air and heaven, it has not <lb/>
            stopped even there, thinking that the world itself is but a <lb/>
            brief limit for its continued and unremitting course. And it is <lb/>
            eager to advance further; and, if it can possibly do so, to com­ <lb/>
            prebend the incomprehensible nature of God, even if only as <lb/>
            to its existence. How, then, is it natural that the human <lb/>
            intellect, being as scanty as it is, and enclosed in no very ample <lb/>
            space, in some membrane, or in the heart (truly very narrow <lb/>
            bounds), should be able to embrace the vastness of the heaven <lb/>
            and of the world, great as it is, if there were not in it some <lb/>
            dortion of a divine and happy soul, which cannot be separated <lb/>
            from it ? For nothing which belongs to the divinity can be cut <lb/>
            off from it so as to be separated from it, but it is only extended. <lb/>
            On which account the being which has had imparted to it a <lb/>
             <pb n="265"/>
            share of the perfection which is in the universe, when it <lb/>
            arrives at a proper comprehension of the world, is extended in <lb/>
            width simultaneously with the boundaries of the universe, and <lb/>
            is incapable of being broken or divided ; for its power is ductile <lb/>
            and capable of extension.</p>
          <p>XXV. Let this then be enough to say concisely about the <lb/>
            essence of the soul. And now proceeding in regular order, we <lb/>
            will explain the expression, that " the voice of his blood cries <lb/>
            out," in this manner,-of our soul, one part is dumb, and one <lb/>
            part is endowed with utterance. All that part which is devoid <lb/>
            of reason is likewise destitute of voice, but all that part which <lb/>
            is rational is capable of speech, and that part alone has formed <lb/>
            any conception of God; for, by the other parts of us, we are <lb/>
            not able to comprehend God, or any other object of the intel­ <lb/>
            lect. Of our vivifying power, therefore, of which the blood is, <lb/>
            as it were, the essence, one portion has particular honour, <lb/>
            namely, that of speech and reason ; I do not mean the stream <lb/>
            which flows through the mouth and tongue, but I speak of the <lb/>
            fountain itself, from which the channels of utterance are, in <lb/>
            the course of nature, filled. And this fountain is the mind; <lb/>
            by means of which, all our conversations with and cries to the <lb/>
            living God take place, at one time being voluntary, and at <lb/>
            another involuntary. But he, as a good and merciful God, <lb/>
            does not reject his suppliants, and most especially he does not, <lb/>
            when they, groaning at the Egyptian deeds and passions, cry <lb/>
            to him in sincerity and truth. For at such a time Moses <lb/>
            says that, " their words go up to God,"* and that he listens to <lb/>
            them, and delivers them from the evils that surround them. <lb/>
            But that all these things should happen when the king of <lb/>
            Egypt dies, should be a most strange thing ; for it would be <lb/>
            natural that when the tyrant died, all those who have been <lb/>
            tyrannised over by him should rejoice and exult; but at that <lb/>
            time they are said to groan. " For after many days the king <lb/>
            of Egypt died, and the children of Israel groaned."t</p>
          <p>Now here, if we look merely at the words, the expression <lb/>
            does not appear to be reasonable ; but if we have regard to <lb/>
            the faculties in the soul, then its consistency is discovered. <lb/>
            For as long as he who scatters abroad and dissipates the <lb/>
            opinions about good things, namely, Pharaoh, is vigorous in us, <lb/>
            and appears in a sound and healthy state, if indeed we can say <note type="footnote"> * Exodus ii 21. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus ii. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="266"/>
            that any wicked man is in such a condition, we receive pleasure, <lb/>
            driving temperance away from our borders. But when he loses <lb/>
            his strength, and in a manner dies, he who has been the cause <lb/>
            of men's living in a filthy and lascivious manner, then we, <lb/>
            fixing our eyes on modesty of life, bewail and groan over our­ <lb/>
            selves on account of our former way of living; because then, <lb/>
            honouring pleasure before virtue, we joined a mortal life to an <lb/>
            immortal one; and the law taking pity on our continued <lb/>
            lamentation, gently receives our suppliant souls, and easily <lb/>
            drives, away the Egyptian calamities which are brought upon <lb/>
            them by the passions.</p>
          <p>XXVI. But on him who is incapable of receiving repent­ <lb/>
            ance on account of the enormity of the pollution which lie has <lb/>
            incurred by the murder of his brother, namely, on Cain, he lays <lb/>
            well-deserved and fitting curses; for in the first place he says <lb/>
            to him, " And now, cursed art thou upon the earth:"* show­ <lb/>
            ing first of all that he is polluted and accursed, not now for <lb/>
            the first time when he has committed the murder, but that <lb/>
            he was so before, the moment that he conceived the idea of it, <lb/>
            the intention being of equal importance with the perfected <lb/>
            action; for as long as we only conceive wicked things in the <lb/>
            bad imagination of our minds, still, during that time, we are <lb/>
            guilty of thoughts only, for the mind is capable of being <lb/>
            changed even against its will; but when performance is added <lb/>
            to the intention that has been conceived, then our deliberate <lb/>
            purpose becomes also guilty; for this is the chief distinction <lb/>
            between voluntary and involuntary sin. But the scripture <lb/>
            here pronounces that the mind shall be accursed, not from <lb/>
            anything else, but from the earth; for of all the most grievous <lb/>
            calamities which can happen to it, the earthly portion which <lb/>
            exists in each of us is found to be the cause. At all events, <lb/>
            when the body is afflicted with disease, it adds the miseries <lb/>
            which are derived from itself, and so fills the mind with grief <lb/>
            and despondency; or, on the other hand, if it has grown fat <lb/>
            immoderately through enjoyment of pleasures, it makes all <lb/>
            the faculties of the mind duller for the comprehension of <lb/>
            nobler objects.</p>
          <p>For, indeed, each of the outward senses is capable of re­ <lb/>
            ceiving injury; for either a man beholding beauty is wounded <lb/>
            by the darts of love, which is a terrible passion ; or else, per­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="267"/>
            haps, if he hears of the death of any one related to him by <lb/>
            birth, he is bowed down by sorrow: very often, too, taste gets <lb/>
            the mastery of a man, when it is either tortured by disagree­ <lb/>
            able flavours, or weighed down by the multitude of delicacies. <lb/>
            And why need I speak of the impetuous passions, which tend <lb/>
            to the connexion of the two sexes? These have destroyed <lb/>
            whole cities, and countries, and mighty nations of the earth: <lb/>
            to which fact nearly the whole multitude, both of poets and of <lb/>
            historians, bears abundant testimony.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And as to the manner in which the mind becomes <lb/>
            accursed upon the earth, he adds further information imme­ <lb/>
            diately afterwards, saying: " The earth which opened her <lb/>
            mouth to receive the blood of thy brother." For it is very <lb/>
            difficult for the mouths of the outward senses to be opened and <lb/>
            widened, as even when they are not open the flood of the objects <lb/>
            appreciable only by them rushes in like an overflowing river, <lb/>
            nothing being capable of resisting their evident impetuosity; <lb/>
            for then the mind is found to be overwhelmed, being wholly <lb/>
            absorbed by so vast a wave, and being utterly unable to swim <lb/>
            against it, or even to raise its head above it; but it is neces­ <lb/>
            sary to employ all these things not so much for whatever <lb/>
            objects can possibly be effected, but for those that are best; <lb/>
            for the sight can perceive all colours and all shapes; but still <lb/>
            it ought to behold only things worthy of light, and not of dark­ <lb/>
            ness. Again, the ear can receive all kinds of sounds ; but <lb/>
            some it ought to disregard; for myriads of the things that are <lb/>
            said are disgraceful. Nor, 0 foolish and arrogant man, because <lb/>
            nature has given you the faculty of taste, ought you to fill your­ <lb/>
            self insatiably with everything, like a cormorant; for there <lb/>
            are many things not merely among such as are nutritious, but <lb/>
            of those which are exceedingly so, which have, nevertheless, <lb/>
            produced diseases accompanied with great suffering.</p>
          <p>Nor does it follow that, because for the sake of the perpetua­ <lb/>
            tion of your race you have been endowed with the powers of <lb/>
            generation, you ought to pursue pollutions and adulteries and <lb/>
            other impure connections; but only such as, in a legitimate <lb/>
            manner, engender and propagate the race of mankind. Nor, <lb/>
            because you have been made endowed with a mouth and a <lb/>
            tongue and the organs of speech, ought you to say everything <lb/>
            and to reveal what ought not to be spoken, for there are times <lb/>
            when to hold one's peace is useful. And, in my opinion, these <lb/>
             <pb n="268"/>
            who have learnt to speak have also learnt to be silent, the <lb/>
            same capacity teaching a man both lines of conduct. But <lb/>
            those men who relate what they ought not, do not display the <lb/>
            faculty of eloquence, but the weakness of their faculty of <lb/>
            silence. On which account we labour to bind each of the <lb/>
            mouthpieces of the senses before-mentioned with the im­ <lb/>
            perishable bonds of temperance. " For whatever is not bound <lb/>
            with a bond," says Moses, in another passage, "-is impure,"* <lb/>
            as if'the cause of its unhappiness was the fact of the parts of <lb/>
            the soul being relaxed and open and dissolved; but that the <lb/>
            fact of their being compacted and tightly bound together con­ <lb/>
            tributed to goodness and soundness of life and reason.</p>
          <p>He, therefore, curses the godless and impious Cain with <lb/>
            deserved curses; because, having opened the caverns of this <lb/>
            concrete creature, he opened his mouth for all external things, <lb/>
            praying to receive them in an insatiable manner and to contain <lb/>
            them, to the utter destruction of the God-loving doctrine, Abel.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " On this account shall he cultivate the earth ;'<foreign xml:lang="grc">Ϯ</foreign> <lb/>
            he does not say, " He shall become a farmer." For every <lb/>
            farmer is an artist, because farming is an art. But any of <lb/>
            the common people are cultivators of the earth, giving their <lb/>
            service to provide themselves with necessaries, without any <lb/>
            skill. These men, then, as they have no superintendent in all <lb/>
            that they do, do much harm ; and whatever they do well they <lb/>
            do by chance, and not in accordance with reason. But the <lb/>
            works of farmers, which are performed according to knowledge, <lb/>
            are all of them, of necessity, useful.</p>
          <p>On this account it is that the law-giver has attributed to the <lb/>
            just Noah the employment of a farmer; ‡ showing by this <lb/>
            that, like a good farmer, the virtuous man eradicates in the <lb/>
            wild wood all the mischievous young saplings which have been <lb/>
            planted by the passions or by the vices, but leaves untouched <lb/>
            all those which bear fruit, and which may act instead of a wall <lb/>
            and prove a firm defence for the soul. And, again, among the <lb/>
            trees capable of cultivation he manages them in different ways, <lb/>
            and not all in the same way: pruning some and adding props <lb/>
            to others, training some so as to increase their size, and cutting <lb/>
            down others so as to keep them dwarf. Again, when he sees a <lb/>
            vine flourishing and luxuriant he bends down its young shoots <lb/>
            to the ground, digging trenches to receive them, and again <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xix. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis ix. 90. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="269"/>
            heaping up the ground on the top of them ; and they at no dis­ <lb/>
            tant period, instead of parts, become whole trees, and instead <lb/>
            of daughters they become mothers, having moreover put off <lb/>
            the old age which is the usual companion of maternity. For, <lb/>
            having desisted from distributing and apportioning its nourish­ <lb/>
            ment amongst numerous offspring, inasmuch as they are able <lb/>
            to support themselves, that which was previously weak from <lb/>
            being drained by this cause becomes so fully satiated as to <lb/>
            grow fat and young again.</p>
          <p>And I have seen another man who cut away the less de­ <lb/>
            sirable shoots of trees which admitted of cultivation, as soon <lb/>
            as they appeared above the ground, and left only a small piece <lb/>
            adhering to the root itself. And then taking a branch in good <lb/>
            condition from another tree of a good sort, he scraped away <lb/>
            the one shoot down till he came to the pith, and the shoot <lb/>
            which was attached to the root he cut at no great depth, but <lb/>
            opening it just sufficiently to make the union perfect, and <lb/>
            then putting into the cleft the shoot which he had pared away <lb/>
            he fitted it in ; and from these two shoots one single tree of one <lb/>
            united nature sprang up, each portion giving to the other that <lb/>
            which was useful to it; for the roots support the shoot which <lb/>
            has been fitted into them, and prevent it from drying up and <lb/>
            withering, and the shoot which has been inserted as a reward <lb/>
            for its nourishment supplies the root with good fruit in requital. <lb/>
            There are also an innumerable host of other operations in <lb/>
            farming which proceed on rules of art, which it would be <lb/>
            superfluous to enumerate on the present occasion, for we have <lb/>
            only dwelt on this point at such length for the purpose of <lb/>
            showing the difference between the man who is only a cul­ <lb/>
            tivator of the earth, and one who is a farmer.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Accordingly the bad man never ceases from employ­ <lb/>
            ing, without any of the principles of art, his earth-like body, <lb/>
            and the outward senses which are akin to it, and all the <lb/>
            external objects of these outward senses, and he injures his <lb/>
            miserable soul, and he also injures what he fancies he is <lb/>
            benefiting exceedingly, his own body.</p>
          <p>But the good man, for he has skill in the art of a farmer, <lb/>
            manages the whole of his materials in accordance with the <lb/>
            principles of art and reason ; for when the outward senses <lb/>
            behave insolently, being borne forward with irresistible im­ <lb/>
            petuosity towards the external objects of the outward senses, <lb/>
             <pb n="270"/>
            they are easily restrained by some contrivance among those <lb/>
            which art has devised; but when an impetuous passion in <lb/>
            the soul becomes violent, bringing forth voluptuous itchings <lb/>
            and ticklings arising from pleasure or from appetite, or on <lb/>
            the other hand, stings and agitation, caused by fear or grief, <lb/>
            it is softened by the previously prepared saving medicine; and <lb/>
            if any evil devouring as it goes, proceeds further, like a sister <lb/>
            of the cancrous disease, which creeps over the body, it is cut <lb/>
            out by reason which proceeds in its operations in accordance <lb/>
            with knowledge.</p>
          <p>In this manner then the trees of the wild wood are brought <lb/>
            into a state of tameness, but all the plants of the cultivated <lb/>
            and fruit-bearing virtues have for their shoots studies, and for <lb/>
            their fruits virtuous actions, of each of which the farming <lb/>
            skill of the soul promotes the growth, and as far as depends <lb/>
            upon it, it makes them immortal by its industry.</p>
          <p>XXX. Very clearly therefore is the good man thus shown <lb/>
            to be a farmer, and the bad man to be only a cultivator of the <lb/>
            land; and I wish that while he is thus cultivating the land, <lb/>
            the earthly nature which environs him, bad imparted some <lb/>
            vigour to him, and had not, as it has, taken away something of <lb/>
            the power which he had before, for we read in the scripture, <lb/>
            "It shall not add its strength to thee to give it to thee," and <lb/>
            such would be the character of a man who was always eating <lb/>
            or drinking and never satisfied, or who was incessantly in­ <lb/>
            dulging in the pleasures of the belly, and devoting his energies <lb/>
            to the gratifying of his carnal appetites, for deficiency produces <lb/>
            weakness, but fulness produces strength ; but when, amid <lb/>
            abundance of things an insatiability is united with excessive in­ <lb/>
            temperance, that is hunger; and they are truly wretched <lb/>
            whose bodies are filled, while their passions are empty and <lb/>
            still thirsting; but of the lovers of knowledge the prophet <lb/>
            speaks in a great song, and says, "That she has made them to <lb/>
            ascend upon the strength of the earth, and has fed them upon <lb/>
            the produce of the fields,"* showing plainly that the godless <lb/>
            man fails in attaining his object, in order that he may grieve <lb/>
            the more while strength is not added to these operations in <lb/>
            which he expends his energies, but while on the other hand it <lb/>
            is taken from them; but they who follow after virtue, placing <lb/>
            it above all these things which are earthly and mortal, dis­ <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="271"/>
            regard their strength in their exceeding abundance, using God <lb/>
            as the guide to conduct them in their ascent, who proffers to <lb/>
            them the produce of the earth for their enjoyment and most <lb/>
            profitable use, likening the virtues to fields, and the fruits of <lb/>
            the virtues to the produce of the fields, according to the prin­ <lb/>
            ciples of their generation ; for from prudence is derived prudent <lb/>
            action, and from temperance temperate action, and from <lb/>
            piety pious conduct, and from each of the other virtues is <lb/>
            derived the energy in accordance with it.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Now these energies are especially the food of the <lb/>
            soul, which is competent to give suck, as the lawgiver says, <lb/>
            " Honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock,"* mean­ <lb/>
            ing by the solid rock which cannot be cut through, the wisdom <lb/>
            of God, which is the nurse and foster-mother and educator of <lb/>
            those who desire incorruptible food ; for it, as the mother of <lb/>
            those things which exist in the world, immediately supplies <lb/>
            food to those beings which are brought forth by her; but they <lb/>
            are not all thought worthy of divine food, but only such are <lb/>
            honoured with that as do not show any degeneracy from their <lb/>
            parent; for there are many which a scarcity of virtue, which <lb/>
            is more terrible than a scarcity of meat and drink, has de­ <lb/>
            stroyed ; but the fountain of divine wisdom is borne along, <lb/>
            at one time in a more gentle and moderate stream, and at <lb/>
            another with greater rapidity and a more exceeding violence <lb/>
            and impetuosity. When, therefore, it descends gently it <lb/>
            sweetens after the manner of honey, but when it comes on <lb/>
            swiftly the whole material enters like oil into the light of <lb/>
            the soul.</p>
          <p>This rock, Moses, in another place, using a synonymous <lb/>
            expression, calls manna the most ancient word of God, by <lb/>
            which appellation is understood, something of the most ge­ <lb/>
            neral possible nature, from which two cakes are made, one of <lb/>
            honey and the other of oil, that is to say, two different sys­ <lb/>
            tems of life, exceedingly difficult to distinguish from one <lb/>
            another, both worthy of attention, at the very beginning <lb/>
            instilling the sweetness of these contemplations which exist in <lb/>
            the sciences, and again emitting the most brilliant light to <lb/>
            those who take hold of the things which are the objects of <lb/>
            their desire, not fastidiously, but firmly, and scarcely by means <lb/>
            of unremitting and incessant perseverance. These then, as I <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxiii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="272"/>
            have said before, are they who ascend up upon the strength <lb/>
            of the earth.</p>
          <p>XXXII. But to the impious Cain, neither does the earth <lb/>
            contribute anything to give him vigour, even though he never <lb/>
            concerns himself about anything which is exterior to it; on <lb/>
            which account, in the next sentence, he is found " groaning <lb/>
            and trembling upon the earth,"* that is to say, under the in­ <lb/>
            fluence of grief and terror ; and such also is the miserable life <lb/>
            of a wicked man, who has received for his inheritance the <lb/>
            most painful of the four passions, pain and terror; the one <lb/>
            being equivalent to groaning, and the other to trembling; for <lb/>
            it is inevitable, that some evil should either be present to or <lb/>
            impending over such a man. Now the expectation of im­ <lb/>
            pending evil causes fear, but the suffering of present evil <lb/>
            causes pain.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, he who pursues virtue is found to be <lb/>
            in the enjoyment of corresponding blessings; for either he <lb/>
            has acquired what is good or he will attain to it. Now the <lb/>
            present possession perfects joy, which is the best of all pos­ <lb/>
            sessions ; but the expectation of possessing it brings hope, <lb/>
            the food of those souls which love virtue ; on account of which, <lb/>
            putting away sluggishness, we, with spontaneous readiness, <lb/>
            hasten onwards to good actions. From that soul therefore, in <lb/>
            which justice has brought forth a male offspring, that is to say <lb/>
            just thoughts, it has also at the same time removed all pain­ <lb/>
            ful things, and the birth of Noah will bear testimony in con­ <lb/>
            firmation of this, and the interpretation of the name of Noah <lb/>
            is just; and of him it is said, " he will make us to rest from <lb/>
            our works, and from the labours of our hands, and from the <lb/>
            earth, which the Lord God has cursed ;"t for it is the nature <lb/>
            of justice in the first place to cause rest instead of labour, <lb/>
            being utterly indifferent to the things that are in the confines <lb/>
            between wickedness and virtue, riches and glory, and power <lb/>
            and honour, and all other things which are akin to these, <lb/>
            which are the chief objects of the energies of the human race. <lb/>
            And, in the second place, to destroy those pains which exist <lb/>
            in accordance with our own energies; for Moses does not (as <lb/>
            some wicked men do) say. that God is the cause of evils, but <lb/>
            our own hands; indicating, by a figurative expression, the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis v. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="273"/>
            works of our hands, and the voluntary inclinations of our <lb/>
            mind to the worser part.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Last of all, Noah is said " to comfort us concern­ <lb/>
            ing our work, because of the ground which the Lord God hath <lb/>
            cursed."* But by this is meant wickedness, which is esta­ <lb/>
            blished in the souls of foolish men; the remedy for which (as <lb/>
            one seeks for remedies for a severe disease) is found to be the <lb/>
            just man, who is in possession of the panacea, justice. When, <lb/>
            therefore, he has repelled these evils he is filled with joy, as <lb/>
            also is Sarah : for she says, " The Lord hath caused me <lb/>
            laughter;" and she adds further, Iso that whosoever hears it <lb/>
            shall rejoice with me. "† For God is the author of virtuous <lb/>
            laughter and joy ; so that we must look upon Isaac not as the <lb/>
            offspring of creation, but as the work of the uncreate God. <lb/>
            For if Isaac, being interpreted, means laughter, and if it be <lb/>
            God who is the cause of laughter according to the true testi­ <lb/>
            mony of Sarah, then he may be most properly said to be the <lb/>
            father of Isaac. And he also gives a share to Abraham of his <lb/>
            own proper appellation, to whom, when he eradicated pain <lb/>
            from wisdom, he gave rejoicing as an offspring. If, therefore, <lb/>
            any one is worthy to listen to the account of the creative power <lb/>
            of God he is of necessity joyful, and rejoices in company with <lb/>
            those who have had a longing to hear the same. And in the <lb/>
            account of the creative power of God you will find no cunningly <lb/>
            devised fable, but only unalloyed laws of truth firmly established. <lb/>
            Moreover, you will find no vocal measures or rhythm, no <lb/>
            melodies alluring the hearing with musical art; but only most <lb/>
            perfect works of virtue, which have all of them a peculiar har­ <lb/>
            mony and fitness. And as the mind rejoices which is eager to <lb/>
            hear of the works of God, so also does language, which is in <lb/>
            harmony with the conceptions of the mind, and which in a <lb/>
            manner is compelled to attend to them, feel exultation.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. And this will also be proved by the oracle which <lb/>
            was given to the all-wise Moses, in which these words are con­ <lb/>
            tained : " Behold, is there not Aaron thy brother, the Levite? <lb/>
            I know that he will speak for thee; and behold he will be <lb/>
            coming forth to meet thee, and he will rejoice in himself when <lb/>
            he seeth thee. "‡ For here the Creator says, that he knows <lb/>
            that uttered speech is a burden to the mind, because it speaks ; <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 29. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxi. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus iv. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> T </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="274"/>
            for he represents it, that is to say, articulate sound, as the <lb/>
            organ, as it were, of all this concrete being of ours. This <lb/>
            speech speaks, and discourses, and interprets both in your case <lb/>
            and mine, and in that of all mankind, the things conceived in <lb/>
            the mind, and it moreover comes forward to meet the things <lb/>
            - which the mind conceives; for when the mind being excited <lb/>
            towards any object connected with it receives an impetus, either <lb/>
            because it has been moved internally by itself, or because it has <lb/>
            received some remarkable impressions from external circum­ <lb/>
            stances, it then becomes pregnant and labours to bring forth <lb/>
            its conceptions. And, though it tries to deliver itself of them, <lb/>
            it is unable to do so till sound, like a midwife, acting either <lb/>
            through the medium of the tongue or of some other of the <lb/>
            organs of speech, receives those conceptions and brings them <lb/>
            to light. And this voice is itself the most manifest of all the <lb/>
            conceptions. For, as what is laid up is hidden in darkness <lb/>
            until light shines upon it and exhibits it, in the same manner <lb/>
            the conceptions are stored away in an invisible place, namely, <lb/>
            the mind, until the voice, like light, sheds its beams upon them <lb/>
            and reveals everything.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Very beautifully, therefore, was it said that speech <lb/>
            goes forth to meet the conceptions, and that it runs on endea­ <lb/>
            vouring to overtake them, from its desire of giving information <lb/>
            respecting them, for everything has the greatest affection for <lb/>
            its own proper employment; and the proper employment of <lb/>
            speech is to speak, to which employment therefore it hastens <lb/>
            by a kind of natural kindred and propriety. And it rejoices <lb/>
            and exults when, shedding its rays upon it as it were, it accu­ <lb/>
            rately sees and overtakes the sense of the matter exhibited ; for <lb/>
            then, seizing it in its embrace, it becomes its most excellent <lb/>
            interpreter. At all events, we repudiate those chatterers and <lb/>
            interminable talkers, who, in the long passages of their con­ <lb/>
            versations, do not properly keep to their conceptions, but <lb/>
            merely connect long and empty and, to say the truth, lifeless <lb/>
            sentences.</p>
          <p>Therefore the conversation of such men as these is inde­ <lb/>
            corous, and is justly condemned to groan; as, on the other <lb/>
            hand, it is inevitable that that conversation which proceeds <lb/>
            from a proper consideration of the objects of its consideration <lb/>
            must rejoice, since it comes in an adequate manner to the in­ <lb/>
            terpretation of the things which it saw and comprehended <lb/>
             <pb n="275"/>
            vigorously; and this is a matter within the knowledge of almost <lb/>
            every one from his daily experience. For, when we thoroughly <lb/>
            understand what we are saying, then our speech rejoices and <lb/>
            exults, and is rich in most emphatic and appropriate expres­ <lb/>
            sions, with which, using great copiousness and fluency of un­ <lb/>
            hesitating diction, it sets before the hearer what it desires to <lb/>
            exhibit to him in a most evident and efficient manner. But <lb/>
            when the comprehension of the conceptions is doubtful, then <lb/>
            the speech stumbles and exhibits a great deficiency of suitable <lb/>
            and felicitous expressions, and speaks very inappropriately; on <lb/>
            which account it is tedious and wearisome and wanders about, <lb/>
            and instead of persuading its hearers it pains their ears.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Again, it is not every speech which should come <lb/>
            forward to meet the conceptions; nor is it every kind of con­ <lb/>
            ception that it should come to meet; but only the perfect <lb/>
            Aaron who should come forward to meet the conceptions of the <lb/>
            most perfect Moses. Since else why, when God had said, <lb/>
            " Behold, is not Aaron thy brother ?" did he add, " the Levite," <lb/>
            if it were not for the sake of teaching that it belongs to the <lb/>
            Levite and priest, and to virtuous speech alone, to give inform­ <lb/>
            ation respecting the conceptions of the mind, which are <lb/>
            shoots of the perfect soul. For never may the speech of a <lb/>
            wicked man be interpreter of divine doctrines, for such an one <lb/>
            would deform their beauty by his own pollutions; and, on the <lb/>
            other hand, may what is intemperate and disgraceful never be <lb/>
            related by the utterance of a virtuous man, but may sacred and <lb/>
            holy conversations always deliver the relation of holy things.</p>
          <p>In some of the best governed cities of the world they say <lb/>
            that such a custom as this prevails. When any man who has <lb/>
            not lived well attempts to deliver his opinion, either in the <lb/>
            council or in the assembly of the people, he is not permitted to <lb/>
            do so by his own mouth, but is compelled by the magistrates to <lb/>
            deliver his opinion to some virtuous and honourable man to <lb/>
            explain in his behalf; and then he, when he has heard what <lb/>
            he wishes said, rises up and unfolds the meaning of the sewn <lb/>
            up mouth of his instructor, becoming his extempore pupil; <lb/>
            and he displays the imaginations of another, scarcely consider­ <lb/>
            ing the original concern of them even in the rank of a hearer <lb/>
            or spectator. So some people do not choose to receive even <lb/>
            benefits from unworthy persons, but look upon the injury <note type="footnote"> T 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="276"/>
            accruing from the shame of taking their advice as greater than <lb/>
            the. advantage which can be derived from it.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. This lesson the most holy Moses appears to <lb/>
            teach; for such is the object of the statement that Aaron the <lb/>
            Levite is coming forward to meet his brother Moses, and that <lb/>
            when he sees him he rejoices in himself; and the statement <lb/>
            that he rejoices in himself shows also, besides the doctrine <lb/>
            which has already been mentioned, another more connected <lb/>
            with politics, since the lawgiver is here exhibiting that genuine <lb/>
            joy which is most especially akin to the human race; for to <lb/>
            speak strictly, the feeling of joy does not belong to abundance <lb/>
            of money, or of possessions, or to brilliancy of renown, nor, in <lb/>
            short, to any one of those external circumstances which are <lb/>
            lifeless and unstable, and which contain the seeds of their <lb/>
            decay in themselves: nor yet does it belong to personal <lb/>
            strength and vigour, and to the other advantages of the body, <lb/>
            which are common to even the most worthless men, and which <lb/>
            have often brought inevitable destruction on those who pos­ <lb/>
            sessed them.</p>
          <p>Since then it is only in the virtues of the soul that genuine <lb/>
            and unadulterated joy is found, and since every wise man <lb/>
            rejoices, he rejoices in himself, and not in his surrounding <lb/>
            circumstances ; for the things that are in himself are the virtues <lb/>
            of the mind on which it is worthy for a man to provide him­ <lb/>
            self : but the circumstances which surround him are either <lb/>
            a good condition of body or an abundance of external wealth, <lb/>
            which are not proper objects for a man to pride himself on.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. Having shown, therefore, as far as we could by <lb/>
            the most unmistakeable testimony of Moses that, to rejoice is <lb/>
            the peculiar property of the wise man, we will now also show <lb/>
            that to hope also belongs to him alone; and here again we <lb/>
            shall have no need of any other witness than Moses ; for he <lb/>
            tells us that the name of the son of Seth was Enos : and Enos, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means hope. " He hoped first," says Moses, <lb/>
            "to call upon the name of the Lord his God."* Speaking <lb/>
            wisely : for to a man inspired with the principles of truth what <lb/>
            can be more akin and appropriate than a hope and expectation <lb/>
            of the acquisition of good things from the one bounteous God ? <lb/>
            This, if one must speak the plain truth, is, properly speaking, <lb/>
            the only real birth of men, as those who do not hope in God <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 26. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="277"/>
            have no share in rational nature. On which account Moses, <lb/>
            after he had previously mentioned with respect to Enos that <lb/>
            " he hoped to call upon the name of the Lord his God," adds <lb/>
            in express words, " This is the book of the generation of <lb/>
            men;"* speaking with perfect correctness: for it is written in <lb/>
            the book of God that man is the only creature with a good <lb/>
            hope. So that arguing by contraries, he who has no good <lb/>
            hope is not a man. The definition, therefore, of our concrete <lb/>
            being is that it is a living rational mortal being ; but the defi­ <lb/>
            nition of man, according to Moses, is a disposition of the soul <lb/>
            hoping in the truly living God.</p>
          <p>Let good men, then, by all means having received joy and <lb/>
            hope for their blessed inheritance, either possess or expect <lb/>
            good things : but let bad men, of whom Cain is a companion, <lb/>
            living in fear and pain, reap a harvest of a most bitter portion, <lb/>
            namely, either the presence or the expectation of evils, groan­ <lb/>
            ing over the miseries which are actually oppressing them, and <lb/>
            trembling and shuddering at the expected fearful dangers.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. However, we have now said enough on this sub­ <lb/>
            ject, and let us proceed to investigate what comes afterwards.</p>
          <p>He continues thus: " And Cain said unto the Lord, My <lb/>
            crime is too great to be forgiven."t Now what is meant by <lb/>
            this will be shown by a consideration of simple passages. If <lb/>
            a pilot were to desert his ship when tossed about by the sea, <lb/>
            would it not follow of necessity that the ship would wander out <lb/>
            of her course in the voyage ? Shall I say more ? If a cha­ <lb/>
            rioteer in the contest of the horse-race were to quit his chariot, <lb/>
            is it not inevitable that the course of the free horses would be <lb/>
            disorderly and irregular ? Again, when a city is left destitute <lb/>
            of rulers or of laws, and laws, undoubtedly, are entitled to be <lb/>
            classed on an equality with magistrates, must not that city be <lb/>
            destroyed by those greatest of evils, anarchy and lawlessness ? <lb/>
            And in the same manner, by the ordinances of nature, the body <lb/>
            must perish if the soul be absent; and the soul, if reason be <lb/>
            absent. Reason, too, must be destroyed by the absence of <lb/>
            virtue. But if each of these things is such an injury to the <lb/>
            things that are abandoned by them, then how great must we <lb/>
            consider is the misfortune of those persons who are abandoned <lb/>
            by God ? Whom he has rejected as deserters from his band : <lb/>
            and put out of the pale of his sacred laws, considering them <note type="footnote"> * Genesis v. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="278"/>
            them unworthy of his superintendence and governmerit. For <lb/>
            we must absolutely be certain that a person who is deserted <lb/>
            by his superior and benefactor is guilty of great crimes and <lb/>
            liable to severe accusations. For when would you say that a <lb/>
            man destitute of skill is most greatly injured ? Would it not <lb/>
            be when he is utterly abandoned by knowledge ? And when <lb/>
            would you say that the ignorant and wholly uninstructed man <lb/>
            is most injured ? Must it not be when instruction and educa­ <lb/>
            tion complete their desertion of him? When again do we <lb/>
            most deplore the condition of the foolish ? Is it not when <lb/>
            prudence has utterly rejected them ? And when do we pro­ <lb/>
            nounce intemperate or unjust men, miserable? Is it not <lb/>
            when temperance and justice have condemned them to an <lb/>
            eternal banishment from their dominion ? When do we pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the impious, wretched ? Is it not when piety has cut <lb/>
            them off from her peculiar rites ? So that it seems to me that <lb/>
            those who are not utterly impure should pray to be chastised <lb/>
            and rejected rather than deserted ; for desertion will most <lb/>
            easily ruin them, as vessels without ballast and without a <lb/>
            pilot; but correction will set them right again. Are not those <lb/>
            boys who are beaten by their preceptors, for whatever errors <lb/>
            they commit, better than those who have no schoolmaster ? <lb/>
            And are not those who are reproved by their teachers, for all <lb/>
            the errors they commit in the arts which they are studying, <lb/>
            better than those who receive no such reproof? And are not <lb/>
            those young men who have been accounted especially worthy <lb/>
            of that natural superintendence and government, which those <lb/>
            who are parents exercise over their children, more fortunate and <lb/>
            better than those who have had no such protectors? And if <lb/>
            they have not such natural protectors, do they not receive <lb/>
            guardians as governors in a secondary rank, who are accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to be appointed over them out of pity for their orphan <lb/>
            state; to fill the place of parents to them in all things that are <lb/>
            expedient ?</p>
          <p>XL. Let us, therefore, address our supplications to God, <lb/>
            we who are self-convicted by our consciousness of our own sins, <lb/>
            to chastise us rather than to abandon us; for if he abandons <lb/>
            us, he will no longer make us his servants, who is a merciful <lb/>
            master, but slaves of a pitiless generation : but if he chastises <lb/>
            us in a gentle and merciful manner, as a kind ruler, he will <lb/>
            correct our offences, sending that correcting conviction, his <lb/>
             <pb n="279"/>
            own word, into our hearts, by means of which he will heal <lb/>
            them; reproving us and making us ashamed of the wicked­ <lb/>
            nesses which we have committed. On this account the law­ <lb/>
            giver says, " Every word which a widow or a woman who is <lb/>
            divorced vows against her own soul shall remain against it."* <lb/>
            For if we call God the husband and father of the universe, <lb/>
            supplying the origin and generation of all things, we shall be <lb/>
            speaking rightly : as we shall if we call that heart widowed <lb/>
            and divorced from God which either has not received divine <lb/>
            seed, or, after having received it, has again voluntarily made <lb/>
            it abortive. Therefore every thing which it decides it shall <lb/>
            decide against itself: and these things shall remain utterly <lb/>
            incurable.</p>
          <p>For how can it be anything but a most intolerable evil, for <lb/>
            a creature which is inconstant and easily moved in every <lb/>
            direction, to lay down any positive decision and determination <lb/>
            about itself, attributing to itself the virtues of the Creator ? <lb/>
            One of which is that, according to which, it defines in an <lb/>
            unhesitating and unalterable manner. Therefore, not only <lb/>
            shall it be widowed of knowledge, but it shall likewise be divorced <lb/>
            from it. And the meaning of this expression is as follows :— <lb/>
            For the soul which is widowed of, but is not yet divorced from, <lb/>
            what is good, is able, in a manner, after long perseverance, to <lb/>
            come to a reconciliation and agreement with her lawful <lb/>
            husband, right-reason. But the soul which has once been <lb/>
            utterly separated from it, and which has been removed to a <lb/>
            different abode, has been cast out for ever and ever, as utterly <lb/>
            incapable of reconciliation or peace, and is entirely unable to <lb/>
            return to its previous habitation.</p>
          <p>XLI. This, then, may be enough to say about the ex­ <lb/>
            pression, " My crime is too great to be forgiven."†</p>
          <p>Let us now consider what follows that verse .—" Cain says, <lb/>
            " But if thou castest me out this day from off the face of the <lb/>
            earth, and from thy face I shall be hidden." ‡ What sayest <lb/>
            thou, my good man ? If thou art utterly cast out from the <lb/>
            whole earth, shall you still be hidden ? In what manner ? <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxx. 10. </note><note type="footnote"> t This is not the translation given in the text of the bible, though it <lb/>
            is inserted in the margin. In the text of the bible we read, "And Cain <lb/>
            said unto the Lord, my punishment is greater than I can bear."— <lb/>
            Genesis iv. 13. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iv. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="280"/>
            For shall you be able to live ? or are you ignorant of this, that <lb/>
            nature has given animals different places to live in, and has <lb/>
            not assigned the same place to them all ? She has allotted <lb/>
            the sea to the fishes, and to the whole race of aquatic animals, <lb/>
            and the land to all the terrestrial animals. And man too, <lb/>
            according, at least, to the composite nature of his body, is a <lb/>
            terrestrial animal. And it is owing to this that all animals <lb/>
            easily die when they have quitted the place which properly <lb/>
            belongs to them, and have gone, as it were, into a foreign coun­ <lb/>
            try ; as, for instance, when terrestrial animals go under the <lb/>
            water, or when aquatic animals have sailed out upon the land.</p>
          <p>If, therefore you, being a man, should be cast out from the <lb/>
            land, whither will you turn ? Will you dive under water, <lb/>
            imitating the nature of aquatic animals ? TInt you will die the <lb/>
            moment that you are underneath the water. Or will you take <lb/>
            wings and raise yourself aloft, and so attempt to traverse the <lb/>
            regions of the air, changing your character of a terrestrial, for <lb/>
            that of a flying animal ? But, if it is in your power, change and <lb/>
            re-fashion the divine impress that you bear. You cannot do so. <lb/>
            For in proportion as you raise yourself to a greater height, so <lb/>
            much the more rapidly will you descend from that higher <lb/>
            region and with the greater impetuosity to the earth, which is <lb/>
            your appropriate place.</p>
          <p>XLII. Can a man, then, or any other created animal, hide <lb/>
            himself from God ? Where can he do so ? Where can he hide <lb/>
            himself from that being who pervades all places, whose look <lb/>
            reaches to the very boundaries of the world, who fills the <lb/>
            whole universe, of whom not even the smallest portion of <lb/>
            existing things is deficient ? And what is there extraordi <lb/>
            nary in the fact, that it is not practicable for any created being <lb/>
            to conceal himself from the living God, when it is not even in <lb/>
            his power to escape from all the material elements by which <lb/>
            he is surrounded, but he must, if he abandon me, by that very <lb/>
            act enter into another ? At all events, if the Creator, employ­ <lb/>
            ing that act by which he created amphibious animals, had <lb/>
            chosen also by the same act to create a new animal, one capa­ <lb/>
            ble of living in any element, then, this animal, if it forsook the <lb/>
            weighty elements of earth and water, would necessarily have <lb/>
            gone to those which are naturally light, namely, air and fire. <lb/>
            And, on the other hand, supposing that it had originally dwelt <lb/>
            among those elements whose place is on high, if it had sought <lb/>
             <pb n="281"/>
            to effect a migration from them, it would have changed to the <lb/>
            opposite region; for it was at all events necessary for it to <lb/>
            appear steadily in one portion of the world, since it was not <lb/>
            possible for it to run away out of every element; since, in <lb/>
            order that nothing external might be omitted, the Creator <lb/>
            scattered the whole of the four principles of everything over <lb/>
            the universe, in order to create the existing* condition of the <lb/>
            world, in order to make a most perfect universe of perfect <lb/>
            parts.</p>
          <p>As therefore it is impossible for any one to escape from the <lb/>
            whole of the creation of God, how can it be anything but still <lb/>
            more impossible to escape from the Creator and Ruler him­ <lb/>
            self? Let no one therefore too easily receiving these words in <lb/>
            their obvious and literal acceptation without examination, affix <lb/>
            his own simplicity and folly to the law; but let him rather <lb/>
            consider what is here enigmatically intimated by figurative ex­ <lb/>
            pressions, and so understand the truth.</p>
          <p>XLIII. Perhaps now that which is intimated by the expres­ <lb/>
            sion, "If thou castest me out this day from off the face of the <lb/>
            earth, from thy face I shall be hidden," may be this, if thou <lb/>
            dost not bestow on me the good things of the earth, I will not <lb/>
            receive those of Heaven; and if no use and enjoyment of <lb/>
            pleasure is afforded me, I have no desire for virtue, and if <lb/>
            thou dost not allow me to participate in human advantages, <lb/>
            thou mayest retain the divine ones to thyself. Now the things <lb/>
            which among us are accounted necessary and valuable and <lb/>
            genuine real goods are these; to eat, to drink, to be clothed in <lb/>
            various colours and fashions ; by means of the faculty of sight, <lb/>
            to be delighted with pleasant sights; by means of one's faculty <lb/>
            of hearing to be delighted with melodies of all sorts of sounds; <lb/>
            to be gratified through our nostrils with fragrant exhalations <lb/>
            of odours; to indulge in all the pleasures of the belly and of <lb/>
            the parts adjacent to the belly to satiety ; not to be indifferent <lb/>
            to the acquisition of silver and gold; to be invested with <lb/>
            honours and post of authority, and all other things which may <lb/>
            tend to man's reputation; but as for prudence, or fortitude, <lb/>
            or justice, austere dispositions which only make life laborious, <lb/>
            those we pass by, and if we are forced to admit them into one <lb/>
            calculation we must do so, not as perfect goods in themselves, <lb/>
            but only as efficieuts of good.</p>
          <p>Do you therefore, 0 ridiculous man, affirm that if you are <lb/>
             <pb n="282"/>
            deprived of a superfluity of bodily advantages and external <lb/>
            good things, you will not come into the sight of God? But I <lb/>
            tell you that even if you are so deprived of them, you will <lb/>
            by all means come into his sight; for when you have been <lb/>
            released from the unspeakable bonds of the body and around the <lb/>
            body, you will attain to an imagination of the uncreated God.</p>
          <p>XL VI. Do you not see in the case of Abraham that, "when <lb/>
            he had left his country, and his kindred, and his father's <lb/>
            house,''* that is to say, the body, the outward senses, and <lb/>
            reason, he then began to become acquainted with the powers <lb/>
            of the living God? for when he had secretly departed from all <lb/>
            his house, the law says that, " God appeared unto him, "† <lb/>
            showing that he is seen clearly by him who has put off mortal <lb/>
            things, and who has taken refuge from this body in the'in­ <lb/>
            corporeal soul; on which account Moses taking his tent <lb/>
            " pitches it without the tabernacle, "‡ and settles to dwell at <lb/>
            a distance from the bodily camp, for in that way alone could <lb/>
            he hope to become a worthy suppliant and a perfect minister <lb/>
            before God. And he says that this tent was called the tent <lb/>
            of testimony, taking exceeding care that it may really be the <lb/>
            tabernacle of the living God, and may not be called so only.</p>
          <p>For of virtues, the virtues of God are founded in truth, <lb/>
            existing according to his essence : since God alone exists in <lb/>
            essence, on account of which fact, he speaks of necessity <lb/>
            about himself, saying, " I am that I am,"§ as if those who <lb/>
            were with him did not exist according to essence, but only <lb/>
            appeared to exist in opinion.</p>
          <p>But the tent of Moses being symbolically considered, the <lb/>
            virtue of man shall be thought worthy of appellation, not of <lb/>
            real existence, being only an imitation, a copy made after the <lb/>
            model of that divine tabernacle, and consistent with these <lb/>
            facts is the circumstance that Moses when he is appointed to <lb/>
            be the God of Pharaoh, was not so in reality, but was only <lb/>
            conceived of as such in opinion, " for I know that it is God <lb/>
            who gives and bestows favours, but I am not able to perceive <lb/>
            that he is given, and it is said in the sacred scriptures, " I <lb/>
            give thee as a God to Pharaoh," and yet what is given is the <lb/>
            patient, not the agent; but he that is truly living must be <lb/>
            the agent, and beyond all question cannot be the patient. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xii. 1. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xxxiii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xii. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> § Exodus iii. 14. </note> <pb n="283"/>
            </p>
          <p>What then is inferred from these facts ? Why, that the <lb/>
            wise man is called the God of the foolish man, but he is not <lb/>
            God in reality, just as a base coin of the apparent value of <lb/>
            four drachmas is not a four drachma piece. But when he is <lb/>
            compared with the living God, then lie will be found to be a <lb/>
            man of God; but when he is compared with a foolish man, he <lb/>
            is accounted a God to the imagination and in appearance, but <lb/>
            he is not so in truth and essence.</p>
          <p>XLV. Why then do you talk nonsense, saying, " If thou <lb/>
            castest me forth from off the earth, and from thee I shall be <lb/>
            hidden." For one might say on the contrary, if I remove thee <lb/>
            from the earth by part of thee, then I will manifestly show thee <lb/>
            my own image. And a proof of this is, thou wilt depart from <lb/>
            before the face of God, but when thou hast departed thou wilt <lb/>
            not the less inhabit thy earthly body. For Moses says, after­ <lb/>
            wards, " And Cain went forth from before the face of God <lb/>
            and dwelt in the earth," * so that when thou art cast out from <lb/>
            the earth, thou art not hidden from the living God ; but when <lb/>
            thou desertest him thou takest refuge on earth in a mortal <lb/>
            country. And indeed it will not be the case, that every one <lb/>
            who findeth thee will hide thee, as thou sayest, speaking <lb/>
            sophistically. For that which is found, is found in every case <lb/>
            by two people, by one who resembles itself, or by one who is <lb/>
            dissimilar. By one who resembles itself according to the <lb/>
            kindred and relationship which exists in all things, and by <lb/>
            him who is not like, according to the contrary unlikeness.</p>
          <p>The one, therefore, that is like, endeavours to preserve that <lb/>
            which resembles itself, and that which is dissimilar endeavours <lb/>
            to destroy that which differs from it. And let them know that <lb/>
            Cain, and all other wicked men will not be slain by any one <lb/>
            who meets them, but that evil doers imitating their kindred <lb/>
            and connected wickednesses, will become guardians and pre­ <lb/>
            servers of them; but all those who have cultivated prudence <lb/>
            or any other virtue, will destroy them if they can, as irrecon­ <lb/>
            cileable enemies. For, in short, all bodies and all things are <lb/>
            preserved by the things which are akin to and attached to them, <lb/>
            but are destroyed by those that are alien and hostile to them. <lb/>
            On this account, also, the oracle which bears testimony against <lb/>
            this pretended simplicity of Cain, says, " You do not think as <lb/>
            you say " For you say, indeed, that whosoever finds out the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xli. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="284"/>
            devices of your act will slay you. But you know that it is not <lb/>
            every one who will do so, as there are millions of men enrolled <lb/>
            in your alliance; but he only who is a friend to virtue and an <lb/>
            irreconcileable enemy to you. And God says, he " who slays <lb/>
            Cain shall suffer sevenfold." But I do not know what analogy <lb/>
            this real meaning of this expression bears to the literal inter­ <lb/>
            pretation of it, " He shall suffer sevenfold. For he has not <lb/>
            said what is to be sevenfold, nor has he described the sort of <lb/>
            penalty, nor by what means such penalty is excused or paid.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Therefore, one must suppose that all these things are <lb/>
            said figuratively and allegorically; and perhaps what God means <lb/>
            to set before us here is something of this sort. The irrational <lb/>
            part of the soul is divided into seven parts, the senses of seeing, <lb/>
            of smelling, of hearing, of tasting, and of touch, the organs of <lb/>
            speech, and the organs of generation. If, therefore, any one <lb/>
            were to slay the eighth, that is to say, Cain, the ruler of them <lb/>
            all, he would also paralyse all the seven. For they are all con­ <lb/>
            firmed by the vigorous strength of the mind, and they all feel <lb/>
            weak simultaneously with any weakness exhibited by the mind, <lb/>
            and they all endure relaxation and complete dissolution in <lb/>
            consequence of the destruction which complete wickedness <lb/>
            brings upon them.</p>
          <p>Now these seven senses are unpolluted and pure in the soul <lb/>
            of the wise man, and here also they are found worthy of <lb/>
            honour. But in that of the foolish man they are impure and <lb/>
            polluted, and as I said before, punished, that is, they are worthy <lb/>
            of punishment and chastisement. At all events, when the <lb/>
            Creator determined to purify the earth by means of water, and <lb/>
            that the soul should receive purification of all. its unspeakable <lb/>
            offences, having washed off and effaced its pollutions after the <lb/>
            fashion of a holy purification, he recommended him who was <lb/>
            found to be a just man, who was not borne away by the violence <lb/>
            of the deluge, to enter into the ark, that is to say, into the <lb/>
            vessel containing the soul, namely, the body, and to lead into <lb/>
            it " seven of all clean beasts, male and female," * thinking it <lb/>
            proper that virtuous reason should employ all the pure parts of <lb/>
            the irrational portion of man.</p>
          <p>XLVII. And this injunction which the lawgiver laid down, <lb/>
            is of necessity applicable to all wise men; for they have their <lb/>
            sense of sight purified, their sense of hearing thoroughly ex­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="285"/>
            amined, and so on with all the rest of their outward senses. <lb/>
            Accordingly, they have the faculty of speech free from all spot <lb/>
            or stain, and their appetites which prompt them to indulge the <lb/>
            passions in a state of due subjection to the law. And every <lb/>
            one of the seven outward senses is in one respect male, and in <lb/>
            another, female. For when they are stationary, or when it is <lb/>
            in motion, they are stationary while quiescent in sleep, and <lb/>
            they are in motion while they are energising in their waking <lb/>
            state; and the one in accordance with habit and tranquillity, as <lb/>
            being subject to passion, is called the female; and the one <lb/>
            which exists according to motion and energy, as one that is <lb/>
            only conceived in action, is called the male.</p>
          <p>Thus, in the wise man, the seven senses appear to be pure; <lb/>
            and on the contrary in the wicked man, they appear to be all <lb/>
            liable to punishment. For how great a multitude of things do <lb/>
            we imagine to be each day wrongly represented by our eyes, <lb/>
            which go over to colours and shapes, and to things which it is <lb/>
            not lawful to see ? And how so great a multitude of things <lb/>
            suffer similar treatment from the ears which follow all kinds of <lb/>
            sounds ? How many too are misrepresented by the organs of <lb/>
            smelling and of taste, and by flavours and vapours, and' other <lb/>
            things led on according to innumerable variations? I say <lb/>
            nothing of that multitude of persons whom the unrestrainable <lb/>
            impetuosity of an unbridled tongue has destroyed, or the in­ <lb/>
            curable violence which leads man on to carnal connections with <lb/>
            intemperate appetite. Cities are full, and all the earth from one <lb/>
            side to the other, is full of these evils, in consequence of which, <lb/>
            continual and unceasing and terrible wars are set on foot <lb/>
            among men, even in times of peace, both publicly and <lb/>
            privately.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. On which account it appears to me that all men <lb/>
            who are not utterly uneducated would choose to be mutilated <lb/>
            and to become blind, rather than to see what is not fitting <lb/>
            to be seen, to become deaf rather than to hear pernicious dis­ <lb/>
            courses, and to have their tongues cut out if that were the only <lb/>
            way to prevent their speaking things, which ought not to be <lb/>
            spoken. At all events, they say that some wise men, when <lb/>
            they have been tortured on the wheel to make them betray <lb/>
            secrets which are not worthy to be divulged, have bitten out <lb/>
            their tongues, and so have inflicted on their torturers a more <lb/>
            grievous torture than they themselves were suffering, as they <lb/>
             <pb n="286"/>
            could not learn from them what they desired; and it is better <lb/>
            to be made an eunuch than to be hurried into wickedness by <lb/>
            the fury of the illicit passions : for all these things, as they <lb/>
            overwhelm the soul in pernicious calamities, are deservedly <lb/>
            followed by extreme punishments.</p>
          <p>Moses says in the next passage that the Lord God set a mark <lb/>
            upon Cain in order to prevent any one who found him from <lb/>
            slaying him ; but what this mark is, he has not shown, although <lb/>
            he is in the habit of explaining the nature of everything by a <lb/>
            sign, as lie does in the affairs of Egypt, where God changed <lb/>
            his rod into a serpent, and withered the hand of Moses till it <lb/>
            became like snow, and turned the river into blood. Or may <lb/>
            we not suppose that this mark was set upon Cain to prevent <lb/>
            his being slain, as a token that he would never be destroyed ? <lb/>
            For he has never once mentioned his death in the whole of <lb/>
            the law, showing enigmatically that, like that fabulous monster <lb/>
            Scylla, so also folly is an undying evil, which never entirely <lb/>
            perishes, and yet which as to its capability of dying receives <lb/>
            all time, and is never wholly free from death.</p>
          <p>And I would that the opposite event might happen, that all <lb/>
            evils might be utterly eradicated, and might endure total <lb/>
            destruction ; but as it is they are constantly budding forth, and <lb/>
            inflict an incurable disease on all who are once infected by <lb/>
            them.</p>

          <p>I. " And Cain went out from before the face of God, and <lb/>
            dwelt in the land of Nod, opposite to Eden."* Now we may <lb/>
            raise the question whether we are to take the expressions which <lb/>
            occur in the books that have been handed down to us by Moses <lb/>
            and to interpret them in a somewhat metaphorical sense, while <lb/>
            the ideas which readily present themselves as derived from the <lb/>
            names are very deficient in truth. For if the living God has a <lb/>
            face, and if he who desires to leave it can with perfect ease rise <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="287"/>
            up and depart to another place, why do we repudiate the im­ <lb/>
            piety of the Epicureans, or the godlessness of the Egyptians, <lb/>
            or the mythical suggestions of which life is full ? For the face <lb/>
            is a portion of an animal; but God is a whole, not a part: so <lb/>
            that it becomes necessary to invent for him other parts also, a <lb/>
            neck, and a chest, and bauds, and moreover a belly, feet, and <lb/>
            generative organs, and all the rest of the countless number of <lb/>
            internal and external faculties. And the fact of God's having <lb/>
            passions like unto those of man follows of necessity from the fact <lb/>
            of his having a form like that of man : since all those limbs <lb/>
            are not superfluous and mere exuberances, but have been made <lb/>
            by nature as assistants of the weakness of those who possess <lb/>
            them, and she has adapted them in a manner suitable to and <lb/>
            consistent with their natural necessities and offices. But the <lb/>
            living God has need of nothing; so that as he does not at all <lb/>
            require the assistance to be derived from the parts of the body, <lb/>
            he7 cannot possibly have such parts at all.</p>
          <p>II. And from whence does Cain go forth ? is it from the <lb/>
            palace of the ruler of the world ? But what house of God can <lb/>
            exist perceptible by the outward senses except this world. which <lb/>
            it is impossible and impracticable to quit ? For the great circle <lb/>
            of the heaven binds round and contains within itself everything <lb/>
            which has ever been created ; and of those things which have <lb/>
            already perished, the component parts are resolved into their <lb/>
            original elements, and are again portioned off among those <lb/>
            powers of the universe of which they consist, the loan which, <lb/>
            as it were, was advanced to each, being restored back at unequal <lb/>
            periods of. time, in accordance with laws previously laid down, <lb/>
            to the nature which originally made it, whenever that nature <lb/>
            chooses to call in its debts.</p>
          <p>Again, if any person goes out from any place, that which he <lb/>
            leaves behind him is in a different place from that in which he <lb/>
            now is, but if this be true it must follow that there are some <lb/>
            portions of the universe: deprived of the presence of God, <lb/>
            who never leaves any place empty or destitute of himself, but <lb/>
            who fills up all things for all time; and if God has not a face <lb/>
            (inasmuch as he is not bound by what may seem appropriate <lb/>
            for created things), and if he does not exist in parts inasmuch <lb/>
            as he surrounds all things and is not surrounded by any, it is <lb/>
            impossible for anything to remove and depart from this world <lb/>
            as from a city, as there is no portion of it left without.</p><pb n="288"/>
            
          <p>It now remains for us, considering that none of these things <lb/>
            are spoken of in terms of strict propriety, to turn to the alle­ <lb/>
            gorical system, which is dear to men versed in natural phi­ <lb/>
            losophy, taking the first principles of our argument from this <lb/>
            source.</p>
          <p>If it is hard to depart from before the face and out of the <lb/>
            sight of a mortal king, how can it be anything but extremely <lb/>
            difficult to depart and quit the appearance of God, and to <lb/>
            determine no longer to come into his sight. This indeed is to <lb/>
            be left without any idea of him, and to be mutilated as to the <lb/>
            eyes of the soul, and all those who of necessity have endured <lb/>
            this fate, being weighed down by the might of irresistible and <lb/>
            implacable power, are objects rather for pity than for hatred; <lb/>
            but all those who voluntarily and of deliberated purposes have <lb/>
            rejected the living God, exceeding even the bounds of wickedness <lb/>
            itself, for what other evil of equal weight can possibly be <lb/>
            found ? Such men should suffer not the usual punishments of <lb/>
            evil doers, but something new and extraordinary. And surely <lb/>
            no one could invent a more novel or more terrible penalty <lb/>
            than a departure and flight from the presence of the Ruler <lb/>
            of the universe.</p>
          <p>III. Accordingly God banished Adam ; but Cain went forth <lb/>
            from his presence of his own accord ; Moses here showing to <lb/>
            us the manner of each sort of absence from God, both the <lb/>
            voluntary and the involuntary sort; but the involuntary sort <lb/>
            as not existing in consequence of any intention on our part, <lb/>
            will subsequently have such a remedy applied to it as the case <lb/>
            admits of; for God will raise up another offspring in the <lb/>
            place of Abel, whom Cain slew, a male offspring for the soul <lb/>
            which has not turned by its own intention, by name Seth, <lb/>
            which name being interpreted means irrigation; but the <lb/>
            voluntary flight from God, as one that has taken place by <lb/>
            deliberate purpose and intention, will await on irremediable <lb/>
            punishment in all eternity, for as good deeds that are done in <lb/>
            consequence of forethought and design, are better than un­ <lb/>
            intentional ones, so also among offences those that are unde­ <lb/>
            signed are of less heinousness than those that are premeditated.</p>
          <p>IV, Therefore punishment which is the chastiser of im­ <lb/>
            pious men, will await Cain who has now departed from before <lb/>
            the face of God, but Moses will suggest to those who know <lb/>
            God, a most excellent suggestion, to love God and to obey <lb/>
             <pb n="289"/>
            him, and cleave to him, for he tells men that this is the life <lb/>
            which in truth is tranquil and lasting,* and he very empha­ <lb/>
            tically invites us to the honour of the one being who is above <lb/>
            all others to be beloved and honoured, bidding us cleave <lb/>
            to him, recommending to us a continual and constant and <lb/>
            inseparable harmony and union of friendship with him. These <lb/>
            suggestions and such as these are what he gives to the rest of <lb/>
            the world, but lie himself so insatiably desires to behold him, <lb/>
            and to be beheld by him, that be supplicates him to display <lb/>
            to his eye his nature of which it is impossible to form a con­ <lb/>
            jecture, so that be may become acquainted with it,t that thus <lb/>
            he might receive a most well-grounded certainty of knowledge <lb/>
            that could not be mistaken, in exchange for uncertain doubts ; <lb/>
            and he will never cease from urging his desire, but even, <lb/>
            though be is aware that he desires a matter which is difficult <lb/>
            of attainment, or rather which is wholly unattainable, be still <lb/>
            strives on, in no way remitting his intense anxiety, but <lb/>
            without admitting any excuse, or any hesitation, or vacillation; <lb/>
            using all the means in his power to gain his object.</p>
          <p>V. At all events, he will now penetrate into " the darkness <lb/>
            where God was."‡ That is to say, into those unapproachable <lb/>
            and invisible conceptions which are formed of the living God. <lb/>
            For the great Cause of all things does not exist in time, nor at <lb/>
            all in place, but be is superior to both time and place ; for, <lb/>
            having made all created things in subjection to himself, he is <lb/>
            surrounded by nothing, but be is superior to everything. And <lb/>
            being superior to, and being also external to the world that he <lb/>
            has made, be nevertheless fills the whole world with himself; <lb/>
            for, having by his own power extended it to its utmost limits, <lb/>
            he has connected every portion with another portion according <lb/>
            to the principles of harmony.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, the soul that loves God seeks to know <lb/>
            what the one living God is according to his essence, it is enter­ <lb/>
            ing upon an obscure and dark subject of investigation, from <lb/>
            which the greatest benefit that arises to it is to comprehend <lb/>
            that God, as to his essence, is utterly incomprehensible to any <lb/>
            being, and also to be aware that he is invisible. And it <lb/>
            appears to me that the great bierophant bad attained to the <lb/>
            comprehension of the most important point in this investiga­ <lb/>
            tion before he commenced it, when he entreated God to become <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxx. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxiii. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus xx. 13. </note> <note type="footnote"> u </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="290"/>
            the exhibitor and expounder of his own nature to him, * for <lb/>
            he says, " Show me thyself;" showing very plainly by this <lb/>
            expression that no created being is competent by himself to <lb/>
            learn the nature of God in his essence.</p>
          <p>VI. On this account too, Abraham, when he had come <lb/>
            unto the place which God had told him of, " On the third day, <lb/>
            looking up, saw the place afar off."t What kind of place? <lb/>
            Was it the place to which he came ? And how was it still afar <lb/>
            off, if he had already come to it? But perhaps the meaning <lb/>
            which is intended under this expression may be something like <lb/>
            this :-The wise man, being always desirous to comprehend the <lb/>
            nature of the Ruler of the universe, when he is proceeding <lb/>
            along the road which leads by knowledge and wisdom, pre­ <lb/>
            viously meets with words of God, among which he rests for a <lb/>
            while ; and though he had previously determined to proceed by <lb/>
            some other road, he now stops and hesitates; for the eyes of <lb/>
            his mind being opened, he sees more clearly that he had <lb/>
            entered upon a chase after a thing which was difficult to over­ <lb/>
            take, which constantly retreated before him, and was always at <lb/>
            a distance, and which outstripped its pursuers by placing an <lb/>
            immeasurable distance between them. You think, therefore, <lb/>
            rightly that all the speediest things which are under heaven <lb/>
            would appear to be standing still if compared with the rapidity <lb/>
            of the sun, and moon, and other stars. And yet the whole <lb/>
            heaven was made by God; and the maker always goes before <lb/>
            that which is made. So that, of necessity, not only the other <lb/>
            things which exist among us, but also that which has the most <lb/>
            rapid motion of all, namely, the mind, may fall short of a <lb/>
            proper comprehension of the great cause of all things by an <lb/>
            undescribable distance.</p>
          <p>But the stars, as they are themselves in motion, pass by all <lb/>
            things that move ; but, though it seems incredible, God, while <lb/>
            standing still, outstrips everything. And it is said that he, at <lb/>
            the same moment, is close to us and at a great distance, touch­ <lb/>
            ing us with his creative or his punishing powers, which are close <lb/>
            to each individual, and yet at the same time driving away the <lb/>
            creature to an excessive distance from his nature as existing <lb/>
            according to its essence, so that it cannot touch him without <lb/>
            even the unalloyed and incorporeal efforts of the intellect. <lb/>
            Therefore we sympathise in joy with those who love God and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="291"/>
            seek to understand the nature of the living God, even if they <lb/>
            fail to discover it; for the vague investigation of what is good <lb/>
            is sufficient by itself to cheer the heart, even if it fail to attain <lb/>
            the end that it desires. But we participate in indignation <lb/>
            against that lover of himself, Cain; because he has left his <lb/>
            soul without any conception whatever of the living God, having <lb/>
            of deliberate purpose mutilated himself of that faculty by which <lb/>
            alone he might have been able to see him.</p>
          <p>VII. It is worth while also to consider the wickedness into <lb/>
            which a man who flies from the face of God is driven, since it <lb/>
            is called a tempest. The law-giver showing, by this expres­ <lb/>
            sion, that he who gives way to inconsiderate impulses without <lb/>
            any stability or firmness exposes himself to surf and violent <lb/>
            tossing, like those of the sea, when it is agitated in the winter <lb/>
            season by contrary winds, and has never even a single glimpse <lb/>
            of calm or tranquillity. But as when a ship having been tossed <lb/>
            in the sea is agitated, it is then no longer fit to take a voyage <lb/>
            or to anchor in harbour, but being tossed about hither and <lb/>
            thither it leans first to one side and then to the other, and <lb/>
            struggles in vain against the waves ; so the wicked mail, yield­ <lb/>
            ing to a perverse and insane disposition, and being unable to <lb/>
            regulate his voyage through life without disaster, is constantly <lb/>
            tossed about in perpetual expectation of an overturning of his <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>But the connection of the consequence affects me in no <lb/>
            moderate degree; for it happens that that which comes near <lb/>
            him who is standing still longs for tranquillity, as being some­ <lb/>
            thing which resembles itself. Now that which stands still <lb/>
            without any deviation is God, and that which is moved is the <lb/>
            creature, so that he who comes near to God desires stability; <lb/>
            but he who departs from him, as by so doing he is approaching <lb/>
            a creature easily overturned, is borne towards that which re­ <lb/>
            sembles it.</p>
          <p>VIII. On this account it is written in the curses contained <lb/>
            in scripture, " Thou shalt never rest; nor shall there be any <lb/>
            rest for the sole of thy foot." * And, a little afterwards, we <lb/>
            read that, " Thy life shall hang in doubt before them."† For <lb/>
            it is the nature of the foolish man, who is always being tossed <lb/>
            about in a manner contrary to right reason, to be hostile to <lb/>
            tranquillity and rest, and not to stand firmly or with a sure <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxviii. 65. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxviii. 66. </note> <note type="footnote"> u Q </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="292"/>
            foundation on any doctrine whatever. Accordingly he is full <lb/>
            of different opinions at different times, and sometimes, even in <lb/>
            the same circumstances, without any new occurrence having <lb/>
            arisen to affect them, he will be perfectly contrary to himself, <lb/>
            -now great, now little, now hostile, now friendly; and, in <lb/>
            short, he will, so to say, be everything that is most inconsistent <lb/>
            in a moment of time. And, as the law-giver says, " All his <lb/>
            life shall hang in doubt before him;" having no firm footing, <lb/>
            but being constantly tossed about by opposing circumstances, <lb/>
            which drag it different ways. On which account Moses says, <lb/>
            in another place, " Cursed of God is he that hangeth on a <lb/>
            tree ;" * because what he ought to hang upon is God.</p>
          <p>But such a man has, of his own accord, bound himself to <lb/>
            the body, which is a wooden burden upon us, exchanging hope <lb/>
            for desire and a perfect hope for the greatest of evils ; for hope, <lb/>
            being the expectation of good things, causes the mind to depend <lb/>
            upon the bounteous God ; but appetite, creating only unreason­ <lb/>
            able desires, depends on the body, which nature has made to be <lb/>
            a sort of receptacle and abode for the soul.</p>
          <p>IX. Let these men, then, hang by their appetites as by a <lb/>
            halter; but the wise Abraham, where he stands, comes near to <lb/>
            God, who is also standing. For Moses says that " Abraham <lb/>
            was standing near to God ; and coming nigh unto him, he <lb/>
            said,"t ••• For in good truth the unalterable soul is the <lb/>
            only tiling that has access to the unalterable God ; and being <lb/>
            of such a disposition, it does really stand very near to the <lb/>
            Divine power. Therefore the oracle which was given to <lb/>
            the all-wise Moses most manifestly shows the lasting good <lb/>
            condition and stability of the virtuous man. Now, the oracle <lb/>
            is as follows: " And do thou thyself stand with me." ‡ By <lb/>
            which expression, two things are made clear. One, that it is <lb/>
            the living God, who moves and turns about all other beings, <lb/>
            being himself unchangeable and immoveable. The second is, <lb/>
            that he makes the virtuous man a participator in his own tran­ <lb/>
            quil nature. For, as I suppose, the crooked things are made <lb/>
            straight by his straight rule; so, likewise, are the things that <lb/>
            are in motion restrained and made stationary by the power of <lb/>
            him who always stands still and firm.</p>
          <p>In this passage, therefore, lie commands another being to <lb/>
            stand with him : but in another place he says, " I will go <note type="footnote"> * Dcut xxi. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Genesis xxviii. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. v. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="293"/>
            down with thee to Egypt, and I will conduct thee to the end." <lb/>
            He does not say, Thou shalt go down with me. Why not ? <lb/>
            Because calmness and stability are the especial attributes of <lb/>
            God; but a liability to change one's place, and every kind of <lb/>
            motion which has a tendency to change the place, is incident <lb/>
            to a created being. When, therefore, he invites the man to <lb/>
            his own peculiar good, he says, " Stand thou with me:" not <lb/>
            " I will stand with thee." For will stand," cannot be said <lb/>
            of God, who always stands still.</p>
          <p>But when he comes to that which is the peculiar attribute <lb/>
            of the creature, he says, with the most perfect correctness, " I <lb/>
            will go down with you;" for change of place is adapted to <lb/>
            you : so that no one shall go down with me, for in me there is <lb/>
            no changing; but whatever is consistent with me, that is to <lb/>
            say, with rest, shall stand. And with those who go down in <lb/>
            such a manner as to change their place (for change of place is <lb/>
            akin to and closely connected with them), I will go down also, <lb/>
            not indeed changing my situation as to its actual place, inas­ <lb/>
            much as I fill every place with myself. And this, too, I do <lb/>
            through the pity which exists in rational nature, in order that <lb/>
            it may be raised from the hell of the passions to the heavenly <lb/>
            region of virtue; I being the guide, who also have made the <lb/>
            road which leads to heaven, so that it may be a plain road for <lb/>
            suppliant souls, and have shown it to them all, in order that <lb/>
            they may not foolishly wander out of the way.</p>
          <p>X. Having, therefore, now pointed out each variety, the <lb/>
            tranquillity of the good man, and the state of agitation in <lb/>
            which the bad man lives, let us now consider what follows the <lb/>
            statement which we have hitherto been examining. For <lb/>
            Moses says that Nod, which name, being interpreted, means <lb/>
            the tumult into which the soul has migrated, is opposite to <lb/>
            Eden. Now Eden is a symbolical expression for correct and <lb/>
            divine reason, on which account its interpretation is luxury; <lb/>
            because divine reason is, above all other things, delighted with <lb/>
            and exults among unmingled and pure, and also well filled up <lb/>
            and complete pleasure, God, the giver of all good things, <lb/>
            raising his virgin and undying graces upon it. But by its own <lb/>
            intrinsic nature, the bad is always striving with the good, the <lb/>
            unjust with the just, the wise with the foolish, and all the <lb/>
            different species of virtue with all the different species of vice. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlvi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="294"/>
            Something like this is the meaning of the statement that Nod <lb/>
            is opposite to Eden.</p>
          <p>XI. After he had said this he proceeds to say, " And Cain <lb/>
            knew his wife, and she conceived and bare Enoch ; and he built <lb/>
            a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son <lb/>
            Enoch." * Is it not here reasonable to raise the question, why <lb/>
            Cain knew his wife ? for there had been no birth of any one other <lb/>
            woman since that of Eve who was formed out of the side of the <lb/>
            man, until the woman who is here mentioned; and if any one says <lb/>
            that Cain took his sister to wife, putting the impiety of such a <lb/>
            connection out of the question, he will speak falsely; for Moses <lb/>
            represents the daughters of Adam as born late. What then are <lb/>
            we to say ? As I imagine, Moses here calls his wife opinion of <lb/>
            impious reason which it forms about things, as crowds of those <lb/>
            who have studied philosophy do : some of them introducing the <lb/>
            same opinions into human life, and others introducing such as <lb/>
            are wholly at variance with one another.</p>
          <p>What then is the position of the impious man ? Why, that <lb/>
            the human mind is the measure of all things; which also they <lb/>
            say that one of the ancient philosophers, Protagoras, used to <lb/>
            employ, being a descendant of the folly of Cain. And from <lb/>
            thence I conjecture that his wife, being known to him, brought <lb/>
            forth Enoch ; and the name Enoch being interpreted means, thy <lb/>
            grace. For if man is the measure of all things, then, also, all <lb/>
            things are a grace and a free gift of the mind; so that we refer <lb/>
            to the eye the grace of sight, to the ears that of hearing, and <lb/>
            to each of the other external senses their appropriate object, <lb/>
            and also to the speech and utterance do we attribute the power <lb/>
            of speaking.</p>
          <p>And if we judge in this manner of these things, so also do <lb/>
            we with respect to intelligence, in which ten thousand things <lb/>
            are comprised, such as thoughts, perceptions, designs, medita­ <lb/>
            tions, conceptions, sciences, arts, dispositions, and a number of <lb/>
            other faculties almost incalculable. What is it then that the <lb/>
            gravest philosophers, who have talked in the most grandiloquent <lb/>
            manner about divine law and the honour due to God, have <lb/>
            determined both to say and to allow to be said, If ye have in <lb/>
            ye a mind which is equal to God, which regulating by its own <lb/>
            power all the good and bad things which exist among men, <lb/>
            occasionally mingles both in certain persons, and sometimes <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="295"/>
            distributes both good and bad to some in an unalloyed state; <lb/>
            and if any one accuses you of impiety, make your defence with <lb/>
            a good courage, saying that you have been brought up very <lb/>
            admirably by your guide and teacher, Cain, who recommended <lb/>
            you to honour the powers that are nearest in preference to that <lb/>
            cause which was afar off, to whom you ought to attend for many <lb/>
            other reasons, and most especially because he showed the power <lb/>
            of his doctrine by very evident works, having conquered Abel <lb/>
            the expounder of the opposite doctrine, and having removed <lb/>
            and destroyed his doctrine as well as himself. But in my <lb/>
            opinion and in that of my friends, death in the company of the <lb/>
            pious would be preferable to life with the impious; for those <lb/>
            who die in the company of the pious everlasting life will receive, <lb/>
            but everlasting death will be the portion -of those who live in the <lb/>
            other way.</p>
          <p>XII. But as after Cain had begotten Enoch, one of the pos­ <lb/>
            terity of Seth is also subsequently called Enoch, it may be well <lb/>
            to consider, whether the two namesakes were men of different <lb/>
            or of similar dispositions and characters. And at the same time <lb/>
            that we examine this question let us also investigate the differ­ <lb/>
            ences between other persons bearing the same name. For as <lb/>
            Enoch was, so also Methusaleh and Lamech were both descen­ <lb/>
            dants of Cain, and they were no less the descendants of Seth <lb/>
            also. We must therefore be aware that each of the aforesaid <lb/>
            names, being interpreted, has a double signification; for Enoch, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means, as I have already said, " thy grace," <lb/>
            and Methusaleh means, the sending forth of death. Lamech, <lb/>
            again means, humiliation. Now the expression, " Thy grace , <lb/>
            is by some persons referred to the mind that is in us ; and by <lb/>
            more learned and sounder interpreters it is referred to the <lb/>
            mind of other persons. They therefore who say that all thinking, <lb/>
            and feeling, and speaking, are the free gifts of their own soul, <lb/>
            utter an impious and ungodly opinion, and deserve to be classed <lb/>
            among the race of Cain, who, though he was not able to master <lb/>
            himself, yet dared to assert that he had absolute possession of <lb/>
            all other things ; but as for those persons who do not claim <lb/>
            all the things in creation as their own, but who ascribe them <lb/>
            to the divine grace, being men really noble and sprung out of <lb/>
            those who were rich long ago, but of those who love virtue and <lb/>
            piety, they may be classed under Seth as the author of their <lb/>
            race. The race of these men is difficult to trace, since they <lb/>
             <pb n="296"/>
            show a life of plotting, and cunning, and wickedness, and disso­ <lb/>
            luteness, full of passion and wickednesses, as such a life must <lb/>
            be. For all those whom God, since they pleased him well, has <lb/>
            caused to quit their original abode, and has transformed from <lb/>
            the race of perishable beings to that of immortals, are no <lb/>
            longer found among the common multitude.</p>
          <p>XIII. Having, therefore, thus distinguished the indications <lb/>
            intended to be afforded by the name of Enoch, let us now <lb/>
            proceed in regular order to the name of Methuselah; and this <lb/>
            name is interpreted, a sending forth of death. Now there are <lb/>
            two meanings contained in this word; one, that according to <lb/>
            which death is sent to anyone, and the other, that according to <lb/>
            which it is sent away from any one. He, therefore, to whom <lb/>
            it is sent, immediately dies, but he, from whom it is sent, lives <lb/>
            and survives. Accordingly, he who receives death is akin to <lb/>
            Cain, who is dying as to the life in accordance with virtue; <lb/>
            but he from whom death is sent away and kept at a distance, <lb/>
            is most nearly related to Seth, for the good man enjoys real <lb/>
            life. And again, the name Lamech, which means humili­ <lb/>
            ation, is a name of ambiguous meaning ; for we are humiliated <lb/>
            either when the vigour of our soul is relaxed, according to the <lb/>
            diseases and infirmities which arise from the irrational pas­ <lb/>
            sions, or in respect of our love for virtue, when we seek to <lb/>
            restrain ourselves from swelling self-opinions.</p>
          <p>Now the former kind of humiliation arises out of weakness, <lb/>
            being a species of that multiform disease of many changes. <lb/>
            leprosy. " For when his appearance seems more humble,"* <lb/>
            being broken as to its level and fresh face, than the lawgiver <lb/>
            says that that humble disease leprosy exists. But the second <lb/>
            kind of humiliation arises from the strength of perseverance, <lb/>
            which is followed by propitiation, according to the perfect <lb/>
            number of the decade; for the people are enjoined to humble <lb/>
            their souls on the tenth day of the month, and this means to <lb/>
            put away all high boasting, the putting away of which works <lb/>
            the rejection of all offences, both voluntary and involuntary. <lb/>
            Accordingly, the Lamech who is humbled in this sense, is the <lb/>
            descendant of Seth, and the father of the just Noah; but he <lb/>
            who is humbled in the former manner is the descendant <lb/>
            of Cain.</p>
          <p>XIV. And it may become us next to consider on what <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xiii 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="297"/>
            account this same man is represented as founding and building <lb/>
            a city, for it is only a multitude of men who have need of a <lb/>
            city to dwell in ; but the three who were the only human beings <lb/>
            in existence at that time might have thought the foot of a <lb/>
            mountain, or a small cave, a most sufficient abode. And I <lb/>
            said, indeed, the three ; but in all probability I might have <lb/>
            spoken of him by himself; for the parents of Abel, who had <lb/>
            been so treacherously slain, would never have endured to <lb/>
            inhabit the same city with his murderer-a man who had <lb/>
            committed fratricide, which is a greater pollution than even <lb/>
            homicide.</p>
          <p>For it is plain that it is not only extraordinary, but utterly <lb/>
            contrary to all reason, that one man should build a city. In <lb/>
            what manner could he do it ? He could not build even the <lb/>
            most trifling portion of a house, unless he employed other men <lb/>
            as his assistants. Would the same man be able at the same <lb/>
            time to cut stones, to cut wood, to work in iron and in brass, <lb/>
            and to throw the vast circumference of walls round the city ? <lb/>
            to build up propylaea, and inter-walls, and temples, and sacred <lb/>
            precincts, and porticoes, and docks, and houses, and all the <lb/>
            other public and private buildings which one is accustomed to <lb/>
            find in a city ? And moreover, besides all these things, would <lb/>
            he be able to carry burdens, to move away masses of earth, to <lb/>
            widen narrow passages, to make fountains and water-courses, <lb/>
            and all the other things with which a city ought to be provided? <lb/>
            Perhaps, therefore, since all these ideas are inconsistent with <lb/>
            truth, it would be better to look upon the statement as an alle­ <lb/>
            gory, and to say that Cain determined to build up his own <lb/>
            doctrine like a city.</p>
          <p>XV. Since, therefore, every city consists of houses and <lb/>
            inhabitants, and laws, the houses, in Cain's case, are the <lb/>
            reasons which he alleges to prove his point; by which, as from <lb/>
            a wall, he fights against the persuasive attacks of his enemies ; <lb/>
            inventing fabulous devices against the truth. The inhabitants <lb/>
            are the companions of impiety, ungodliness, self-love, haughti­ <lb/>
            ness, falsehood, vain opinions; the men wise in their own <lb/>
            conceit, the men who know not wisdom as relating to truth. <lb/>
            the men who are full of ignorance, and stupidity, and folly: <lb/>
            and all the other similar and kindred evils. The laws are, <lb/>
            lawlessness, injustice, inequality, intemperance, boldness, folly, <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxiii. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="298"/>
            insolence, immoderate indulgence in pleasure, and innume­ <lb/>
            rable appetites in despite of nature.</p>
          <p>Now of such a city as this, every impious man is found to <lb/>
            be a builder in his own miserable soul, until God deliberately <lb/>
            causes complete and great confusion to their sophistical arts.* <lb/>
            And this will be, when not only " they build a city and tower, <lb/>
            the head of which will reach to heaven," that is to say,† .... <lb/>
            the mind or the reason of each individual as conversant about <lb/>
            making great works, which they represent as having for its <lb/>
            head a conception peculiar to itself, which is called in symbol­ <lb/>
            ical language heaven. For it is plain that the head and <lb/>
            object of every reasoning must be the aforesaid mind; for the <lb/>
            sake of which, long digressions and sentences are in the habit <lb/>
            of being used by men who write histories.</p>
          <p>XVI. And to such a pitch of accursed impiety have they <lb/>
            gone, that not only do they attempt to raise up such cities by <lb/>
            themselves, but they even compel the virtue-loving multitude <lb/>
            of Israel to join them, appointing superintendents and <lb/>
            teachers of evil actions to govern them. For it is said <lb/>
            that, when they were ill-treated by the superintendents, <lb/>
            they built three cities for the prince of the country, <lb/>
            Peithom, Rameses, ‡ and On, which is Heliopolis. And these <lb/>
            cities, if taken symbolically, mean mind, the outward sense, <lb/>
            and the faculty of speech, which are the three principal things <lb/>
            in us; for Peithom means speech, because persuasion (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τό <lb/>
            πείθειν</foreign>) arises from speech; and the interpretation of Peithom <lb/>
            is, a mouth-uttering, since the reasoning of the wicked man <lb/>
            comes from without, and occupies itself with endeavouring to <lb/>
            overturn all that is good: and Rameses is the inward sense; <lb/>
            for the mind is eaten out and destroyed by each separate one <lb/>
            of the outward senses as by a moth, being shaken to pieces and <lb/>
            lacerated; for the imaginations which enter it, not according <lb/>
            to pleasure, make life itself mutilated and laborious. But On <lb/>
            is said to be a hill, and it means, symbolically, the mind ; for <lb/>
            all reasonings are stored up in the mind: and the lawgiver <lb/>
            himself is a witness of this, calling On, Heliopolis, the city of <lb/>
            the sun. For as the sun, when he rises, shows visibly the things <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> t There is a hiatus in the text here : Mangey translates it as if the <lb/>
            deficiency were to be supplied by rov <foreign xml:lang="grc">νοῦν</foreign>, " the mind." </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus i. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="299"/>
            which have been hidden by night, so also the mind, sending <lb/>
            forth its own proper light, causes all bodies and all things to <lb/>
            be seen visibly at a distance. On which account, a man would <lb/>
            not be wrong who called our minds the sun of our composition; <lb/>
            as the mind, if it does not rise and shed its own light in man, <lb/>
            who may be looked upon as a small world, leaves a great dark­ <lb/>
            ness diffused over all existing things, and suffers nothing to be <lb/>
            brought to light.</p>
          <p>XVIII. This hill Jacob, the wrestler with God, in his <lb/>
            agreements with Laban, calls a witness, showing in a most <lb/>
            express manner, and in the form of a precept, that the mind <lb/>
            is a witness to each individual of the determinations which he <lb/>
            comes to in secret; and conscience, which is the most incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible and truth-telling witness of all, was built before these <lb/>
            cities; for Moses says that the spies came to Chebron, and <lb/>
            these three are Acheman, and Jesein, and Thalamein, of the <lb/>
            sons of Enoch: and this he adds, " and Chebron was built <lb/>
            seven years before Janis, in Egypt,"* and these synonymous <lb/>
            appellations are distinguished according to their species in a <lb/>
            most natural manner.</p>
          <p>Chebron, being interpreted, means compunction, and this is <lb/>
            of two kinds ; one with reference to the soul being joined to <lb/>
            the body, the other with reference to its being adapted to <lb/>
            virtue. Now the soul that subjects itself to bodily conpunc­ <lb/>
            tions has the beforementioned inhabitants. Acheman, being <lb/>
            interpreted, means, my brother, and Jesein means " outside <lb/>
            of me," and Thalmein means, some one in suspense; for it <lb/>
            follows of necessity, that the body must be thought akin to <lb/>
            the souls that love the body, and that external good things <lb/>
            must be exceedingly admired by them, and all the souls which <lb/>
            have this kind of disposition depend on dead things, and, <lb/>
            like persons who are crucified, are attached to corruptible <lb/>
            matter till the day of their death.</p>
          <p>But the soul that is united to virtue has for its inhabitants <lb/>
            those persons who are pre-eminent for virtue, persons whom <lb/>
            the double cavern has received in pairs. Abraham and Sarah, <lb/>
            Isaac and Rebeckah, Leah and Jacob, virtues and those who <lb/>
            possess them; Chebron itself keeping the treasure-house of <lb/>
            the memorials of knowledge and wisdom, which is more <lb/>
            ancient than Janis and the whole land of Egypt, for nature <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xiii. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="300"/>
            has made the soul more ancient than the body, that is than <lb/>
            Egypt, and virtue more ancient than vice, that is than Janis, <lb/>
            (and the name Janis, being interpreted, means the com­ <lb/>
            mand of answer), estimating seniority rather by dignity than <lb/>
            by length of time.</p>
          <p>XVIII. On which principle also it is that he also calls <lb/>
            Israel, who was the younger brother in point of time, " the <lb/>
            first born son,"* judging of him by his merit, signifying <lb/>
            thereby that, since to see God is the most clear proof of pri­ <lb/>
            mogeniture, he is in consequence pardoned as the eldest <lb/>
            offspring of the uncreate incomprehensible God, conceived by <lb/>
            that virtue which is hated among men, and to whom the law <lb/>
            enjoins that "the honours due to seniority shall be paid, as <lb/>
            being the eldest." t</p>
          <p>On this account also the number seven is produced in its <lb/>
            order, subsequently to the number six, but in power it is <lb/>
            superior to every other number, and differs not from the unit, <lb/>
            and Moses also shows us this in the conclusion of his account <lb/>
            of the creation, where he says, " And God ceased on the seventh <lb/>
            day from all the works that he had made; and God blessed the <lb/>
            seventh day, and hallowed it," because on it he ceased from all <lb/>
            his works which God had begun to make,‡ and after that he <lb/>
            concludes his account in these words, " This is the book of the <lb/>
            generation of heaven and of earth when they were made, on <lb/>
            the day in which God made the heaven and the earth; <lb/>
            and these things were done in the first day, so that the <lb/>
            seventh day is referred to the unit which is the first day and <lb/>
            the beginning of the whole.</p>
          <p>I have dwelt at length on this topic, with the object of <lb/>
            showing more plainly the opinion which Cain thought it right <lb/>
            to build up like a city.</p>
          <p>XIX. Now the son of Enoch is called Gaidad,§ which, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means a flock of sheep, very consistently <lb/>
            with what has gone before; for he who attributes everything <lb/>
            to the mind, which is not able to comprehend even its own <lb/>
            nature, so as to pronounce what kind of thing it is, would be <lb/>
            very likely to beget a number of irrational powers collected <lb/>
            into one flock; for such is not the opinion of men who are <lb/>
            able to reason. But every flock which has not a shepherd to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iv. 22. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis ii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxi. IT. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis iv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="301"/>
            govern it does of necessity meet with great disasters, inas­ <lb/>
            much as it is not able, of its own power, to repel what is <lb/>
            injurious to it, and to choose what will be advantageous; in <lb/>
            respect of which Moses says in his prayer, " Let the Lord, <lb/>
            the God of spirits and of all flesh, look out a man who shall <lb/>
            be over this assembly, who shall go out before their faces, and <lb/>
            who shall come in, and who shall bring them out, and who <lb/>
            shall bring them in, and so the synagogue of the Lord shall <lb/>
            not be like unto sheep which have no shepherd."* For when <lb/>
            the president, or superintendent, or father, or whatever we <lb/>
            like to call him, of our composite body, right reason, is de­ <lb/>
            parted, having left the flock that is in us, it being neglected <lb/>
            and suffered to go its own way, perishes; and the loss to its <lb/>
            master is great. But the irrational and wandering flock, being <lb/>
            deprived of its shepherd, who ought to admonish and instruct <lb/>
            it, strays away to a great distance from rational and im­ <lb/>
            mortal life.</p>
          <p>XX. On which account the son of Gaided is called Mehel, <lb/>
            the name which, being interpreted, means, " from the life of <lb/>
            God." For since the flock is devoid of reason, and God is the <lb/>
            fountain of reason, it follows of necessity, that a man who lives <lb/>
            in an irrational manner is separated from the life of God ; for <lb/>
            to live according to God is defined by Moses to consist in <lb/>
            loving him; for Moses says to the children of Israel, " Your <lb/>
            life is to love the living God."t And he gives as an example <lb/>
            of the opposite lot the goat, on which the lot falls to be the <lb/>
            scape-goat, for he says, " He shall place it living before the <lb/>
            Lord, that he may offer prayers over it, and send it out into <lb/>
            the wilderness,"‡ giving these directions with great exactness. <lb/>
            For as no one in his senses would greatly extol old men for <lb/>
            abstaining from pleasure, because old age, which is a long and <lb/>
            incurable disease, has relaxed and enfeebled the nerves of <lb/>
            their appetites; but one would praise young men, because, <lb/>
            while their appetites are influenced by the vigour of youth, <lb/>
            nevertheless they, being well supplied with instruments to <lb/>
            check them, namely, with reasons derived from good instruc­ <lb/>
            tion, have allayed the great conflagration and boiling over of <lb/>
            the passions: so, in the case of these men, whom no disease <lb/>
            is accustomed to detach from any evil way of life, less praise is <lb/>
            due to them, because they are fortunate without any express <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxvi. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut xxx. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus xvi. 10. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="302"/>
            intention of their own, according to the good fortune of their <lb/>
            nature: but those whom such a disease does rise up against <lb/>
            and attack, receive greater praise; if they, making a fair <lb/>
            stand, are willing and prove able to destroy it; for to be able, <lb/>
            by a vigorous exertion, to destroy the baits of attractive <lb/>
            pleasure, properly receives that praise which belongs to good <lb/>
            actions, done with a deliberate purpose.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, * but diseases and in <lb/>
            firmities which have been sent against us flourish; let us <lb/>
            endeavour to overturn and destroy them. For to offer prayers <lb/>
            over them has nearly such an effect as this: it is confessing <lb/>
            that, though we have them in our soul living and flourishing, <lb/>
            we nevertheless do not yield, but make a stand against them <lb/>
            all, and resist them vigorously, until we have entirely sent away <lb/>
            the scape-goat and made atonement.</p>
          <p>XXI. What, then, follows a man who lives not in accordance <lb/>
            with the will of God but the death of the soul ? And this is <lb/>
            named Methuselah, the interpretation of which name is, " the <lb/>
            sending out of death," on which account he is the son of <lb/>
            Mehel, who has quilted his own life, to which death is sent, <lb/>
            that is to say the death of the soul, which is nothing else than <lb/>
            a conversion of it by irrational passion. This passion, there­ <lb/>
            fore, when it has conceived, brings forth incurable diseases and <lb/>
            infirmities with great pains, by which it is thrown down and <lb/>
            convulsed, and humbled and tortured. For each of the diseases <lb/>
            oppresses it, bringing upon it an unspeakable burden, such that <lb/>
            no one is able even to raise his head beneath it. And this is <lb/>
            named Lamech; the interpretation of which name is, <lb/>
            " humiliation;" so that Lamech is properly represented as the <lb/>
            son of Methuselah, being the passion of the death of the soul, <lb/>
            humble, yielding, an infirmity which is the offspring of irra­ <lb/>
            tional desire.</p>
          <p>XXII. " And Lamech took to himself two wives; the name <lb/>
            of the one was Adah, and the name of the other was Zillah." t <lb/>
            Everything which a wicked man taketh himself is altogether <lb/>
            blameable, as being polluted by his impure mind ; and so, on <lb/>
            the contrary, all deliberate actions of virtuous men are praise­ <note type="footnote"> * There is something lost from the text here, and Mangey professes <lb/>
            himself unable to supply it without the assistance of some MS. which <lb/>
            may be hereafter discovered. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="303"/>
            worthy; on which account now, Lamech, who is taking wives <lb/>
            unto himself, is choosing the greatest possible evils. <lb/>
            Again, when Abraham, Jacob, and Aaron take to themselves <lb/>
            wives, they choose appropriate good things to dwell with. Now <lb/>
            Moses speaks thus in the case of Abraham: " And Abraham <lb/>
            and Nachortook unto themselves wives ; the name of Abraham's <lb/>
            wife was Sarai." * And in the case of Jacob he says, " Rise <lb/>
            up and go into Mesopotamia, to the house of Bethuel, thy <lb/>
            mother's father, and take unto thyself a wife from thence of the <lb/>
            daughters of Laban thy mother's brother, t In the case of <lb/>
            Aaron he says, and Aaron took Elizabeth, the daughter of <lb/>
            Aminadab, the sister of Naassom, unto him to be his wife."‡ <lb/>
            Isaac too and Moses take unto themselves wives, but they do <lb/>
            not take them of their own act entirely; but Isaac, "When <lb/>
            he went into the house of his mother," § is said to have taken <lb/>
            a wife ; and to Moses, " The man with whom he lodged gave <lb/>
            his daughter Zipporah to be his wife." ||</p>
          <p>XXIII. Now it is not without a purpose that the differ­ <lb/>
            ences between these persons are recorded by the lawgiver. <lb/>
            For in the case of those who practise virtue and improve, and <lb/>
            become better, their deliberate choice of the good bears testi­ <lb/>
            mony that their labour shall not be dismissed without its <lb/>
            reward; but in the case of those who are endued with self- <lb/>
            taught and naturally implanted wisdom, it follows that reason <lb/>
            is betrothed to them not by their own act, but by God, and <lb/>
            that they take unto themselves knowledge, the fitting com­ <lb/>
            panion through life of the wise. But he who is wholly devoted <lb/>
            to the things of ordinary men, the lowly and grovelling­ <lb/>
            minded Lamech, first of all takes for his wife Adah, which <lb/>
            name being interpreted, means " witness," having been his <lb/>
            own manager of this marriage. For he thinks that Leah, <lb/>
            which means the motion and passage out of the mind accord­ <lb/>
            ing to easy perceptions, without anything interfering to hinder <lb/>
            its easy comprehension of all things, is the first good for man. <lb/>
            " For what," says he, " could be better than that one's <lb/>
            thoughts, one's contemplations, one's conjectures, one's sus­ <lb/>
            picions, in a word, all one's ideas, should, as I may say, proceed <lb/>
            on well-set feet, so as to arrive at their desired goal without <lb/>
            stumbling, the mind being borne witness to in everything that <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xi. 29. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxviii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Exodus vi. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Genesis xxiv. 67. </note> <note type="footnote"> || Exodus ii. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="304"/>
            is uttered." But I, if any man employs a felicitous and well <lb/>
            directed mind to good objects only, account that man happy <lb/>
            taking the law for my teacher in this view. For the law called <lb/>
            Joseph "a prosperous man,"* not in all things, but "in <lb/>
            those matters in which God gave him prosperity." And all <lb/>
            the gifts of God are good. But if any one uses the acuteness <lb/>
            and readiness of his nature, not solely for virtuous objects, but <lb/>
            also for opposite purposes, being himself indifferent in a matter <lb/>
            which is not indifferent, he should be accounted unhappy. At <lb/>
            all events it is said, in the manner of a curse, in the place where <lb/>
            mention is made of the confusion of tongues, "And now nothing <lb/>
            will be restrained from them of all the things which they have <lb/>
            imagined to do. "†</p>
          <p>For in truth it is an irremediable calamity for the soul to <lb/>
            be prosperous in whatever it undertakes, when its undertak­ <lb/>
            ings are disgraceful. But I should pray, if ever I had a <lb/>
            design to commit injustice, that I might fail in my iniquity; <lb/>
            and if I had a wish to live in a manner unbecoming a man, <lb/>
            that I might fail in my intemperance; and if I wished to con­ <lb/>
            duct myself with boldness and unscrupulous wickedness, that <lb/>
            my failure in such boldness and unscrupulous wickedness <lb/>
            might be complete : unless in the case of those who have <lb/>
            determined to steal, or to commit adultery, or to murder, it is <lb/>
            not an advantage to find their purposes in all these matters <lb/>
            fail and become abortive.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Do thou, therefore, 0 my mind, avoid Adah, who <lb/>
            bears witness to evil things, and who is borne witness to on <lb/>
            each of its attempts at such things. And if you think fit to <lb/>
            take her as a partner, she will bring forth to you the greatest <lb/>
            possible evil, namely, Jubal,t the interpretation of which name <lb/>
            is " changing ;" for if you are delighted with any chance testi­ <lb/>
            mony, you will become desirous to upset and overturn every <lb/>
            thing, changing the limits which have been affixed by nature <lb/>
            to every thing. And Moses is very indignant with such <lb/>
            people as these, and curses them, saying, " Cursed is he that <lb/>
            removeth his neighbour's landmark."§ And what he means by <lb/>
            one's neighbours, and that which is near to a man, is the good. <lb/>
            " For it is not good," says he, " to depart to the heaven, nor <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxix. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iv. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xi. 6. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy xxvii. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="305"/>
            to go beyond the sea," * in the search after what is good; for <lb/>
            that stands near to, and close by, each individual.</p>
          <p>And he divides the good by a threefold division, speaking <lb/>
            most strictly in accordance with natural philosophy. " For it <lb/>
            is," says he, " in thy mouth, and in thy heart, and in thy <lb/>
            hands;" that is to say, in thy words, and in thy intentions, <lb/>
            and in thy actions ; for these are the component parts of the <lb/>
            good, of which it is naturally compounded. So that the want <lb/>
            of one portion does not only make the whole incomplete, but <lb/>
            does entirely destroy it; for of what use is it to say what is <lb/>
            excellent, but to think and to do what is most shameful ? This <lb/>
            is the way of the sophists. For those who make long speeches <lb/>
            about prudence and perseverance, annoy the ears even of those <lb/>
            who are very fond of hearing good conversation; and yet, in <lb/>
            their designs and in the actions of their lives they are found <lb/>
            to err. And what is the use of entertaining such sentiments <lb/>
            as are proper, but acting and speaking most improperly, and <lb/>
            injuring by your actions all who are exposed to the effect of <lb/>
            them ? Again, it is blameworthy even to do what is right, with­ <lb/>
            out any intention or reason ; for what is done without these is a <lb/>
            portion of involuntary conduct, and is on no account, and <lb/>
            under no circumstances to be praised ; but if it were to happen <lb/>
            that, as in the case of a lyre, so all the sounds of the good <lb/>
            could be adapted to any man, and that we could make the <lb/>
            conversation agree with the intention, and the intention with <lb/>
            the action ; then such a man would be considered perfect and <lb/>
            really well constituted. So that he who removes the land­ <lb/>
            marks of the good is justly accursed, and is justly spoken of as <lb/>
            such.</p>
          <p>XXV. But it is not our creation that has established <lb/>
            these boundaries, but reasons, which are older than we, <lb/>
            or than any thing upon the earth; and which, moreover, <lb/>
            are divine. In accordance with which the law also has de­ <lb/>
            clared the same thing, charging every one of us not to adul­ <lb/>
            terate the coinage of virtue, in these words, " Thou shalt not <lb/>
            remove thy neighbour's landmark which thy fathers esta­ <lb/>
            blished. "† And in another passage he says, "Ask thy father, <lb/>
            and he will tell thee; ask thy elders, and they will make it <lb/>
            known to thee, how the Most High, when he divided the <lb/>
            nations, dispersed the sons of Adam, and fixed the bounda­ <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxx. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xix. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> x </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="306"/>
            ries of the nations according to the number of the angels of <lb/>
            God. And the portion of the Lord was his people Jacob, the <lb/>
            limitation of the inheritance of Israel."*</p>
          <p>Shall I then inquire of the father who be-at me and brought <lb/>
            me up, or of those who are his contemporaries, but older than <lb/>
            I am ? or has God divided the nations, or sown them, or <lb/>
            settled them in the land ? and will they answer me accurately <lb/>
            how this was done, as if they had been present at every divi­ <lb/>
            sion ? Surely not. For they will say, We also in our youth <lb/>
            were fond of inquiring of our parents and of those who were <lb/>
            Ider than we, and learnt nothing certain ; for they had nothing <lb/>
            to tell us, and they again professed themselves pupils of those <lb/>
            who knew, since they themselves were ignorant.</p>
          <p>XXVI. Perhaps, therefore, it is the right reason of our <lb/>
            souls that he calls their father, and its companions and friends <lb/>
            that he calls elders. These are they who first established <lb/>
            the boundaries of virtue, to whom it is worth while to become <lb/>
            pupils for the sake of learning and instruction in necessary <lb/>
            things. And what is necessary is as follows. When God was <lb/>
            dividing and drawing a wall between the nations of the soul, <lb/>
            separating those who spoke different languages; and when <lb/>
            establishing the sons of the earth in their abodes, he dispersed <lb/>
            them and removed to a distance from himself those whom he <lb/>
            called the sons of Adam ; then he fixed the boundaries of the <lb/>
            offspring of virtue, making them equal in number to the <lb/>
            angels; for as many angels of God as there are, so many <lb/>
            nations and species of virtue are there.</p>
          <p>What, then, are the portions of his angels, and what is that <lb/>
            share which is the inheritance of the ruler and governor of all ? <lb/>
            The portion of those ministers are the specific virtues; but the <lb/>
            portion of the ruler of all is his chosen people Israel. For he <lb/>
            who sees God, being led on by his most surpassing beauty, has his <lb/>
            inheritance and portion assigned to him in that which he sees. <lb/>
            How, then, can we do any thing but blame Jubal, whose name <lb/>
            being interpreted into the Greek language, means one who <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεταλλοιῶν ἢ μεταποιῶν</foreign>) changes or alters the natures of <lb/>
            things? For those most divine beauties of prudence, and <lb/>
            fortitude, and justice, and other virtues, he did change for the <lb/>
            opposite impressions of folly, and intemperance, and injustice. <lb/>
            and all wickedness, effacing all, the impressions which had <lb/>
            previously been stamped upon the natures of things. <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 7. </note> <pb n="307"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXVII. For it is always the case that if a second impres­ <lb/>
            sion is stamped upon any thing, the mark of any previous one <lb/>
            is effaced. But the impression which is thus made is so far <lb/>
            from permitting evil things to be taken in exchange for what is <lb/>
            good, that it does not allow even what is beautiful to be taken <lb/>
            in exchange for what is laborious ; but looking upon what is <lb/>
            laborious (<foreign xml:lang="grc">πνηόν</foreign>) as evil, since it would be downright folly <lb/>
            not to discard what is bad for the sake of the acquisition of <lb/>
            what is better, but only taking to be equivalent <lb/>
            to <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἐπίπονος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">ϰαματηός</foreign>, in which sense, indeed, the Attic <lb/>
            writers use the word when they mark the first syllable with <lb/>
            an acute, thus, <foreign xml:lang="grc">π</foreign>ó<foreign xml:lang="grc">νηος</foreign>.</p>
          <p>Now the precept is of this kind, "Of every thing which <lb/>
            passeth under the rod, the tenth is sacred to the Lord; thou <lb/>
            shalt not exchange good for bad, and if thou dost exchange, <lb/>
            both the thing itself and that for which it is exchanged shall <lb/>
            be sacred,"* and yet how can that which is evil possibly be <lb/>
            sacred? The truth is that, as I said, he means here what is <lb/>
            laborious, not what is bad ; so that what is really intended is <lb/>
            something of this kind :-The honourable is a perfect good, <lb/>
            but labour is an imperfect advantage. If therefore you acquire <lb/>
            what is perfect, you need no longer seek what is deficient; but <lb/>
            if with an excessive superfluity you choose still to continue <lb/>
            labouring, then know that you will appear to be exchanging <lb/>
            one thing for another, but in reality you will be acquiring both, <lb/>
            for even if both are of equal value they nevertheless are not <lb/>
            completely whole.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. But a thing which is sacred is proved to be so <lb/>
            by three witnesses, the middle number, education, and perfect <lb/>
            number. On which account it is said, ., Of everything which <lb/>
            cometh in the number under the rod, the tenth is sacred," for <lb/>
            that which is not accounted worthy of being comprehended <lb/>
            under number is profane, not sacred; but that which is ac­ <lb/>
            cording to number is approved, as having been already tested. <lb/>
            Accordingly the law says, that the corn which was collected in <lb/>
            Egypt by Joseph could not be counted,"† and adds, " for it <lb/>
            was without number," since the things which nourish the <lb/>
            body and the Egyptian passions, are utterly unworthy to be <lb/>
            included in any calculation. <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xxvii 32, </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xli. 49. </note> <note type="footnote"> x 2 </note> <pb n="308"/>
            </p>
          <p>But the rod is the symbol of education, for without being <lb/>
            looked at sternly, and chastised for some causes, it is impos­ <lb/>
            sible for any one to be admonished and corrected to any good <lb/>
            purpose; but the number ten is a confirmation of that per­ <lb/>
            fection which takes place in accordance with improvement, with <lb/>
            which he must begin who having brought forth an offspring <lb/>
            educated it, and brought the wished-for fruit to maturity.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Thus much it may be sufficient to say concerning <lb/>
            him who changes and adulterates the ancient coinage, whom <lb/>
            Moses also calls the father " of those that dwell in the tents <lb/>
            of those who fed cattle." Now by cattle here he means the <lb/>
            irrational and outward senses, and by those who feed cattle <lb/>
            he means the worshippers of pleasure and indulgences of the <lb/>
            passions, who supply these senses with their external objects <lb/>
            by way of food, and are a long way removed from shep­ <lb/>
            herds. For some, like rulers, chastise those of their flocks <lb/>
            who are unruly : but others, like entertainers or masters of a <lb/>
            feast, supply them with unlimited food, and give them fear­ <lb/>
            lessness as to the consequences of their sins ; for it follows of <lb/>
            necessity that such men are at once victims of insatiable <lb/>
            appetite, and of insolence, the daughter of satiety; accord­ <lb/>
            ingly, he who re-fashions and changes all honourable things <lb/>
            in a seemly and natural manner, is the father of those who <lb/>
            pursue every object of the outward sense, and all other inani­ <lb/>
            mate objects ; for if he had pursued the incorporeal natures <lb/>
            which are accessible only to the intellect, he would have pre­ <lb/>
            served those boundaries marked out by his elders, which they <lb/>
            established as a defence to virtue, stamping each appearance <lb/>
            of virtue with its own appropriate image,*</p>
          <p>XXX. And Jacob's brother, he says, was Jubal,t and the <lb/>
            interpretation of this latter name is " inclining," being sym­ <lb/>
            bolically speech according. to utterance ; for this is naturally <lb/>
            the brother of intellect; and it is with extraordinary propriety <lb/>
            that lie called the conversation of that intellect which changes <lb/>
            affairs, " inclining," for it agrees after a fashion and har­ <lb/>
            monizes with both, as the equivalent weight does in a scale, <lb/>
            or as a vessel which is tossed by the sea inclines first to one <lb/>
            side and then to the other, from the violence of the waves; <lb/>
            for the foolish man has not learnt how to say anything firm <lb/>
            or stable. <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxvii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 21. </note> <pb n="309"/>
            </p>
          <p>But Moses does not think it right to incline either to the <lb/>
            right or to the left, or in short to any part of the earthly <lb/>
            Edom; but rather to proceed along the middle way, which he <lb/>
            with great propriety calls the royal road,* for since God is the <lb/>
            first and only God of the universe, so also the road to him, as <lb/>
            being the king's road, is very properly denominated royal; <lb/>
            and this royal road you must consider to be philosophy, not <lb/>
            that philosophy which the existing sophistical crowd of men <lb/>
            pursues (for they, studying the art of words in opposition to <lb/>
            truth, have called crafty wickedness, wisdom, assigning a divine <lb/>
            name to wicked action), but that which the ancient company <lb/>
            of those men who practised virtue studied, rejecting the <lb/>
            persuasive juggleries of pleasure, and adopting a virtuous and <lb/>
            austere study of the honourable—this royal road, which we <lb/>
            have stated to be true and genuine philosophy, the law calls <lb/>
            the word and reason of God; for it is written, " Thou shalt <lb/>
            not turn aside from the word which I command thee this day, <lb/>
            to the right hand nor to the left," So that it is shown most <lb/>
            manifestly that the word of God is identical with the royal <lb/>
            road, since Closes' words are not to depart either from the <lb/>
            royal road, or from this word, as if the two were synonymous, <lb/>
            but to proceed with an upright mind along the middle and <lb/>
            level road, which leads one aright.</p>
          <p>XXXI. " Now this Jubal," says Moses, " is the father who <lb/>
            showed men the use of the psaltery and of the harp."† He in <lb/>
            the strictest consistency with nature calls distinctly rttered <lb/>
            language the father of music and of all the instruments used <lb/>
            in music; for nature, having given the organ of voice to <lb/>
            animals as the first and most perfect of organs, afterwards gave <lb/>
            to this organ all the harmonies, and all the different kinds of <lb/>
            melodies, in order that it might be a previously made model <lb/>
            for those organs which are hereafter to be made by art. And <lb/>
            as he made an ear spherical, fashioning lesser circles in their <lb/>
            greater ones and framing it as in a lathe, with the object of <lb/>
            preventing the sounds of the voice which come from without <lb/>
            from being wasted and dissipated, so that the voice when col­ <lb/>
            lected together and closely packed within the circle might, by <lb/>
            a sort of diffusion of the power of hearing, be poured over the <lb/>
            different channels of the principal part. And this immediately <lb/>
            served as a model for those theatres which are found in hand­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xx. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis iv. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="310"/>
            some cities; so that the shape of a theatre is skilfully dictated <lb/>
            by the mechanism of the ear.</p>
          <p>So also, nature, which formed animals, stretching the rough <lb/>
            artery like a musical canon, and wearing beneath the harmonic <lb/>
            and chromatic and diatonic kinds of sounds, according to the <lb/>
            innumerable variations of combined and separated melodies, <lb/>
            made a model in accordance with which every musical instru­ <lb/>
            ment might be made.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Perhaps, at all events, flutes and lyres, and similar <lb/>
            instruments which utter melodies, are as far inferior to the <lb/>
            music of nightingales or swans as a thing made after a model, <lb/>
            and an imitation must be from the archetypal model, or a <lb/>
            perishable species from an imperishable genus; for it is not <lb/>
            fitting to compare the music of man with that of any other <lb/>
            animal, since it has an especial privilege with which it is <lb/>
            honoured, namely, articulate distinctness of speaking ; for all <lb/>
            other animals, having a broken utterance in their voice, by this <lb/>
            and by an incessant change of tones alone give pleasure to our <lb/>
            ears. But man, being furnished by nature with the means not <lb/>
            only of speaking but also of singing articulately, charms both <lb/>
            the sense of hearing and the mind, soothing the one with his <lb/>
            song and influencing the other with ideas; for, as an instru­ <lb/>
            ment, if it be given into the hands of a man who has no skill <lb/>
            as a musician, is inharmonious, but if given to a musician it <lb/>
            becomes harmonious according to the skill that is in him. So <lb/>
            in the same manner speech, when put in motion by a worthless <lb/>
            mind, is inharmonious; but, when it is put in motion by a <lb/>
            virtuous mind, it is found to be very melodious. A lyre, in­ <lb/>
            deed, or any similar instrument, if it be not struck by some <lb/>
            one, is silent; and speech, too, if it be not struck by the <lb/>
            principal part, that is to say, the mind, is of necessity tranquil. <lb/>
            And, again, as musical instruments are transposed and adapted <lb/>
            to an infinite number of mixtures of airs, so also speech corre­ <lb/>
            sponds to them, becoming an interpreter of things; for who <lb/>
            would converse in a similar manner with parents and children, <lb/>
            being by nature the slave of the one, and by birth the master <lb/>
            of the others ? And who, again, would talk in the same manner <lb/>
            to brothers or cousins; or, in short, to near and to distant <lb/>
            relations? Who, again, could do so to friends and to stran­ <lb/>
            gers, to fellow citizens and to foreigners, though there may be <lb/>
            no great difference in point of fortune, or nature, or age be­ <lb/>
             <pb n="311"/>
            tween them? For one must behave differently while asso­ <lb/>
            ciating with an old man and with a young one; and, again, <lb/>
            with a man of high reputation and a humble man, with a <lb/>
            servant and a master; and, again, with a woman and a man, <lb/>
            and with an illiterate and a clever man. And why need one <lb/>
            cite an incredible variety of persons to whom speech varies <lb/>
            itself, so as at one time to assume one character and at another <lb/>
            time another? For it would not interpret great things and <lb/>
            small, numerous things and rare, private and public matters, <lb/>
            sacred and profane affairs, or old and new events in the same <lb/>
            manner; but would use, in each case. language appropriate to <lb/>
            the number, or importance, or magnitude of the affairs under <lb/>
            discussion; at one time elevating itself to a lofty style, and at <lb/>
            another time, on the contrary, confining and humbling itself.</p>
          <p>But as circumstances and persons give varieties to speech, <lb/>
            so also do the causes of things and the manner in which they <lb/>
            are done ; and, moreover, those points especially with which <lb/>
            everything is concerned, namely, time and place. Very <lb/>
            beautifully, therefore, is he who inclines voices, namely <lb/>
            Jubal, called " the father of the psaltery and of the harp," from <lb/>
            a portion of the whole science of music, as has been shown <lb/>
            already.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. The descendants, therefore, of Adah, and what <lb/>
            she herself is, have now been explained. Let us consider <lb/>
            next the other wife of Lamech, Zillah, and what she brings <lb/>
            forth. Zillali, then, being interpreted, means " shadow," a sym­ <lb/>
            bol of the qualities of the body and of the external good <lb/>
            things, which, in their real essence, are in no way better than <lb/>
            a shadow. Is not beauty a shadow, which, after it has flou­ <lb/>
            rished for a brief time, withers away? And are not strength <lb/>
            and activity of body shadows, which any chance disease can <lb/>
            destroy? And the organs of the external senses, and the <lb/>
            accuracy of their use, which any sudden cold may obstruct, or <lb/>
            old age, that inevitable and common disease of all men, may <lb/>
            impair, are not they shadows? And, again, are not riches and <lb/>
            glory, and authority and honours, and all the external circum­ <lb/>
            stances which are accounted goods, are not they, I say, all <lb/>
            shadows ? But one ought to lead the mind, as if by the steps <lb/>
            of a flight of stairs, up to the origin of everything.</p>
          <p>Men in the rank of those who are considered illustrious have <lb/>
            gone to Delphi, who have consecrated their happy lives to the <lb/>
             <pb n="312"/>
            service of that place, and like writings which have become <lb/>
            effaced, not only in consequence of the lapse of ages but also by <lb/>
            the vicissitudes which time brings about, they have then expired. <lb/>
            There are some again whom the impetuosity of an <lb/>
            overflowing torrent, as it were. has suddenly extinguished and <lb/>
            carried away. From all these shadows, then, and all these un­ <lb/>
            substantial dreams a son is born, whom his parents called Tubal <lb/>
            (this name being interpreted means "all"). For they with <lb/>
            great wisdom laying it down (instead of those things which are <lb/>
            accounted good things by the multitude) that competency com­ <lb/>
            bined with good health is happiness, consider that in that is <lb/>
            united everything great or small, in short everything. But if <lb/>
            there were any such thing as an absolutely independent autho­ <lb/>
            rity added, then becoming full of arrogant domination, and elated <lb/>
            with vanity and false opinions, forgetting themselves and the <lb/>
            contemptible material of which they are composed, they look <lb/>
            upon themselves as composed of a more valuable material than <lb/>
            the composition of man admits of; and becoming swollen with <lb/>
            pride, they think themselves worthy of even divine honours. <lb/>
            At all events, before now some persons have ventured to say, <lb/>
            that they " do not know the true God,"t forgetting their own <lb/>
            human nature, by reason of the immoderate excess of corporeal <lb/>
            and external things ....... and each imagining ..;‡</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Then Moses says, " He was a hammer-beater and <lb/>
            forger of brass and iron : " § for the soul of that man who is <lb/>
            intent on corporeal pleasures or external things is beaten by a <lb/>
            hammer, like a piece of iron on an anvil, being drawn out <lb/>
            according to the long and thin-drawn extensions of the appe­ <lb/>
            tites. Accordingly, you may see men fond of their bodies at <lb/>
            every time, and in every place laying lines and nets to catch <lb/>
            those objects that they desire; and others, who are lovers of <lb/>
            money or covetous of glory, letting loose their desire and eager­ <lb/>
            ness for those things to the furthest boundaries of earth and sea, <lb/>
            and dragging in from all quarters by their unlimited desires, as <lb/>
            if by so many nets, whatever can gratify them, till the excessive <lb/>
            tension, being broken by its great violence, drags back those who <note type="footnote"> * There is an hiatus in the text in this sentence. I have followed <lb/>
            Mangey's Latin translation. </note><note type="footnote"> t Exodus v. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Another hiatus occurs here. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis iv. 22, where he is called Tubalcain. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="313"/>
            are dragging at it, and throws them down headlong. All these <lb/>
            men are causes of war, on account of which they are said to be <lb/>
            workers in brass and iron, by means of which metals wars are <lb/>
            carried on. For if any one contemplates the history of the <lb/>
            greatest public or private quarrels that have arisen among men <lb/>
            and among cities, he will not be wrong if ....* he looks upon <lb/>
            all of them, whether upon those which took place long ago, or <lb/>
            upon those which are now raging, or on all that will ever arise <lb/>
            hereafter, as being caused either by the beauty of a woman, or by <lb/>
            a love of money, or, in short, by some desire for the excessive <lb/>
            indulgence of the body, and for some superfluity of external <lb/>
            things : but no foreign war and no civil war has ever existed <lb/>
            for the sake of instruction or virtue, which are the good things <lb/>
            of the mind, which is the best part of us ; for these things are <lb/>
            in their nature peaceful, and by them good laws and tranquil <lb/>
            stability, and whatever else is most beautiful to the sharp-seeing <lb/>
            eyes of the soul, not to the dim perceptions of the body, are seen <lb/>
            to be established.</p>
          <p>For the perceptive powers of the body look only upon the <lb/>
            external surface, but the eye of the mind penetrates within, and <lb/>
            going deep clown surveys all the interior and hidden things <lb/>
            which are removed out of the reach of bodily sight. And nearly <lb/>
            all the troubles, and confusions, and enmities which arise among <lb/>
            men, are about absolutely nothing, but about what is really a <lb/>
            shadow: for Moses called Tubal the son of Zillah, that is to <lb/>
            say of shadow, the maker of the warlike instruments of brass <lb/>
            and iron, speaking philosophically, and being guided not by <lb/>
            verbal technicalities, but by the exceeding propriety of the <lb/>
            names ; for he knew that every naval and every land expedition <lb/>
            chooses to encounter the greatest dangers for the sake of bodily <lb/>
            pleasures, or with a view to obtain a superfluity of external good <lb/>
            things, of which nothing is firm or solid, as is testified by the <lb/>
            history of time, which brings all things to proof : for they are <lb/>
            like superficial sketches, being in themselves perishable and of <lb/>
            no duration.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Moses proceeds to say, that Tubal's sister was Noe­ <lb/>
            man, the interpretation of which name is " fatness." For it <lb/>
            follows that those who pursue a luxurious condition of the body, <lb/>
            and the other objects which I have mentioned, do get fat when <lb/>
            they obtain any of the things that they desire : but such fatness <note type="footnote"> * Here again there is an hiatus in the text. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="314"/>
            as this I laN, down as not strength but weakness ; for it teaches <lb/>
            a man to depart from the honour due to God, which is the first <lb/>
            and most excellent power of the soul : and the law is a witness <lb/>
            to this which in the great hymn speaks thus—" He was fat, <lb/>
            he was rich, he was exceeding broad, and he forsook God who <lb/>
            had made him, and lie forgot Gael his Saviour."* For in truth <lb/>
            those men whose lives have been exceedingly fortunate and <lb/>
            are so at the time, do not remember the eternal God, but they <lb/>
            think time their god ; on which account Moses bears witness, <lb/>
            exhorting us to war against the contrary opinions, for he <lb/>
            says, " The time has departed from them, and the Lord is <lb/>
            among us."†</p>
          <p>So that those men by whom the life of the soul is honoured, <lb/>
            have divine reason dwelling among them, and walking with <lb/>
            them ; but those who pursue a life of pleasure have only a brief <lb/>
            and fictitious want of opportunities : these men, therefore, <lb/>
            having swollen extravagantly, and become enormously distended <lb/>
            by their profuse fatness and luxury, have burst asunder. But <lb/>
            the others, being made fat by that wisdom which nourishes the <lb/>
            souls that love virtue, have a firm and unshaken power, a speci­ <lb/>
            men of which is the fat which is sacrificed as a whole burnt- <lb/>
            offering from every victim : for Moses says, " All the fat shall <lb/>
            belong to the Lord by the everlasting law ;"‡ so that the fat of <lb/>
            the mind is offered up to God and is appropriated to him, <lb/>
            owing to which it is made immortal; but the fat which clings <lb/>
            to the body and belongs to external things is referred to time, <lb/>
            which is contrary to God, through which it very rapidly wastes <lb/>
            away.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Therefore, concerning the wives of Lamech and <lb/>
            his children, I think that enough has been said. Let us now <lb/>
            consider what we may look upon as the resurrection of Abel, <lb/>
            who was treacherously slain.</p>
          <p>Moses tells us, " And Adam knew his wife Eve, and she <lb/>
            conceived and brought forth a son, and he called his name <lb/>
            Seth ; for, said he, " God has raised me up another seed instead <lb/>
            of Abel, whom Cain slew."§ The interpretation of the name <lb/>
            Seth, is " irrigation." As, therefore, the seeds and plants which <lb/>
            are put into the ground grow and blossom through being irri­ <lb/>
            gated, and are thus made fertile for the production of fruits, <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> J Leviticus ii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Numbers xiv. 9. </note><note type="footnote"> § Genesis iv. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="315"/>
            but if they are deprived of moisture they wither away, so like­ <lb/>
            wise the soul, as it appears when it is watered with the <lb/>
            wholesome stream of wisdom, shoots forth, and brings fruit to <lb/>
            perfection. Now, irrigation may be looked upon in a two-fold <lb/>
            light: with regard to that which irrigates, and with regard to <lb/>
            that which is irrigated. And might one not say that each of the <lb/>
            outward senses is irrigated by the mind as by a fountain, which <lb/>
            widens and extends all their faculties, as if they were so many <lb/>
            channels for water ? No one, therefore, in his senses would <lb/>
            say, that the eyes see, but that the mind sees by means of the <lb/>
            eyes; or that the ears hear, but that the mind hears by the <lb/>
            instrumentality of the ears ; or that the nostrils smell, but <lb/>
            that the predominant part of man smells through the medium <lb/>
            of the nostrils.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. On which account it is said in Genesis, " And <lb/>
            a fountain went up from the earth, and watered all the face of <lb/>
            the earth."* For since nature has allotted the most excellent <lb/>
            portion of the whole body, namely the face, to the outward <lb/>
            senses, therefore the fountain which goes up from the superior <lb/>
            part, being diffused over various parts, and sending up its <lb/>
            streams like so many water-courses as high as the face, by their <lb/>
            means conducts the faculties to each of the organs of the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses. In this way in truth, it is that the word of <lb/>
            God irrigates the virtues; for that is the beginning and the <lb/>
            fountain of all good actions. And the lawgiver shows this, <lb/>
            when he says, " And a river went out of Eden to water tho <lb/>
            Paradise ; and from thence it is divided into four heads."†</p>
          <p>For there are four generic virtues : prudence, courage, <lb/>
            temperance, and justice. And of these, every single one is a <lb/>
            princess and a ruler ; and he who has acquired them is, from <lb/>
            the moment of the acquisition, a ruler and a king, even if he <lb/>
            has no abundance of any kind of treasure; for the meaning of <lb/>
            the expression, “ it is divided into four heads," is ‡ ....... <lb/>
            nor distance; but virtue exhibits the pre-eminence and the <lb/>
            power. And these spring from the word of God as from one <lb/>
            root, which he compares to a river, on account of the unceasing <lb/>
            and everlasting flow of salutary words and doctrines, by which <lb/>
            it increases and nourishes the souls that love God.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. And of what kind they are, he proceeds to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 10. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Here again is an hiatus, which Mangey does not attempt to supply. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="316"/>
            show in a few words, deriving his explanation from the natural <lb/>
            things of art; for he introduces Agar as filling a leathern bag <lb/>
            with water, and giving her child drink.* Now Agar is the <lb/>
            handmaid of Sarah, the new dispensation of perfect virtue ; <lb/>
            and she is correctly represented so. Since, therefore, having <lb/>
            come to the depth of knowledge, which Moses here calls a <lb/>
            well, she draws up (filling the soul as if it were a vessel) the <lb/>
            doctrines and speculations which she is in pursuit of, wishing <lb/>
            to feed her child on the things on which she herself is fed. <lb/>
            And Moses, by her child, means, a soul which has lately learnt <lb/>
            to desire instruction, and which has, in a manner, just been <lb/>
            born to learn. In reference to which, the boy, when lie has <lb/>
            grown up to man's estate, becomes a sophist, whom Moses <lb/>
            calls an archer; † for whatever argument he applies his mind <lb/>
            to, at that, as at a target, he shoots all his reasons, as an <lb/>
            archer shoots his arrows.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. But Rebekkah is found to give her pupil drink no <lb/>
            longer by improvement, but by perfection. How so the law <lb/>
            will tell us : " For the damsel," says Moses, " was very beauti­ <lb/>
            ful to the sight, and was a maiden ; no man had known her. <lb/>
            And when she had gone down to the fountain, she filled her <lb/>
            pitcher, and came up again; and the servant ran forward to <lb/>
            meet her, and said, Give me now to drink a little water from <lb/>
            thy pitcher. And she said, Drink, my lord. And she made <lb/>
            haste, and took down the pitcher on her arm, and gave to <lb/>
            him to drink until he ceased drinking, And said, and I will also <lb/>
            give to thy camels to drink, until they have all drunk ; and <lb/>
            she made haste, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and <lb/>
            running to the well. she drew water for the camels." ‡</p>
          <p>Here who can help wondering at the minute accuracy of the <lb/>
            lawgiver as to every particular ? He calls Rebekkah a maiden, <lb/>
            and a very beautiful maiden, because the nature of virtue is <lb/>
            unmixed and free from guile, and unpolluted, and the only <lb/>
            thing in all creation which is both beautiful and good ; from <lb/>
            which arose the Stoic doctrine, that the only thing that was <lb/>
            beautiful was the good.</p>
          <p>XL. Now of the four virtues, some are always virgins, and <lb/>
            some from having been women become changed into virgins, as <lb/>
            Sarah did ; " For it had ceased to be with her after the man­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxi. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxiv. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="317"/>
            ner of women," * when she began to conceive her happy <lb/>
            offspring Isaac. But that which is always a virgin, is that of <lb/>
            which Moses says, "And no man whatever knows her." For <lb/>
            in truth, it is not permitted to any mortal to pollute incor­ <lb/>
            ruptible nature, nor even clearly to comprehend what it is. If <lb/>
            indeed he were able by any means to become acquainted with <lb/>
            it, he would not cease to hate and regret it; on which account <lb/>
            Moses, in strict accordance with the principles of natural philo­ <lb/>
            sophy, represents Leah as hated, f For those whom the charms <lb/>
            of pleasures, which are with Rachel, that is to say, with the <lb/>
            outward sense, cannot be endured by Lean, who is situated out <lb/>
            of the reach of the passions ; on which account they repudiate <lb/>
            and detest her. But as far as she herself is concerned, her <lb/>
            alienation from the creature produces her a close connection <lb/>
            with God, from whom she receives the seeds of wisdom, and <lb/>
            conceives, and travails, and brings forth virtuous ideas, worthy <lb/>
            of the father who begot them. If therefore, you, 0 my soul, <lb/>
            imitating Leah, reject mortal things, you will of necessity turn <lb/>
            to the incorruptible God, who will shed over you all the <lb/>
            fountains of his good.</p>
          <p>XLI. " But Rebekkah," says Moses, " went down to the <lb/>
            fountain to fill her pitcher, and came up again." For from <lb/>
            what source is it natural for the mind that thirsts after wisdom <lb/>
            to be filled, except from the wisdom of God, that fountain <lb/>
            which never fails, and to which the soul that descends comes up <lb/>
            again like a virtuous disciple ? For those who descend out of <lb/>
            a vain pride, the reason of virtue receives, and taking them up <lb/>
            by means of fame raises them to a height. On which account <lb/>
            it is that Moses seems to me to use the expression, " Go, <lb/>
            descend, and come up," ‡as if every one who measures his <lb/>
            own loveliness comes forth more gloriously in the eyes of the <lb/>
            judges of truth. And he speaks of these matters with great <lb/>
            caution. For Agar bears a leathern bag to the well, but <lb/>
            Rebekkah carries a pitcher. For the one who devotes himself <lb/>
            to instruction and to the energetical branches of learning has <lb/>
            need of some incorporeal things as it were of the outward <lb/>
            senses, of vessels, and eyes, and ears, for a proper contemplation <lb/>
            of the objects of her speculation. For from seeing many <lb/>
            things and hearing many things, there is derived, in the case of <lb/>
            those who are fond of learning the advantage which proceeds <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxix. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡Exodus xxxii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="318"/>
            from knowledge. But the one who is filled with unalloyed <lb/>
            wisdom has need only of a leathern habitation, which is no <lb/>
            better than none at all. For the soul which loves unsubstantial <lb/>
            things has learnt to put off the whole leathern bag of reasons, <lb/>
            that is to say the body, and brings only a pitcher which is the <lb/>
            symbol of a vessel, which contains the principal portion in <lb/>
            great size and abundance, like water ; as to which, those who <lb/>
            are clever in such matters may make it a subject of philoso­ <lb/>
            phical speculation, whether it is a membrane or a heart. <lb/>
            Therefore, the man who is fond of learning, seeing men im­ <lb/>
            bibing the sciences like water, from wisdom that divine <lb/>
            fountain, runs up, and meeting them becomes a suppliant to <lb/>
            them to know how he may allay his thirst for learning. And <lb/>
            the soul which has received the best possible education, namely. <lb/>
            the lesson not to envy, and to be liberal, immediately proffers <lb/>
            to him the stream of wisdom, and invites him to drink <lb/>
            abundantly, adding also this that she calls him who is only a <lb/>
            servant her lord. This is the meaning of that most dogmatic <lb/>
            assertion, that the wise man alone is free, and a king, even if <lb/>
            he have ten thousand masters over his body.</p>
          <p>XLII. Most correctly, therefore, after the servant has said, <lb/>
            " Give me a little water to drink," does she make answer, not <lb/>
            in the manner corresponding to his request : " I will give you <lb/>
            to drink," but "Drink." For the one expression would have <lb/>
            been suited to one who was displaying the riches of God, <lb/>
            which are poured forth for all who are worthy of them and who <lb/>
            are able to think of them ; but the other expression is appro­ <lb/>
            priate to one who professes that she will teach. But nothing <lb/>
            which is connected with mere professions is akin to virtue. But <lb/>
            he describes in a most skilful manner the language used by her <lb/>
            who teaches and benefits her pupils. For " she made haste," <lb/>
            he says, " and took down the pitcher on her arm." Her alacrity <lb/>
            to serve the man was displayed by her making haste, and such <lb/>
            alacrity is seated in the mind, beyond which envy is cast away. <lb/>
            But by the expression, " taking down the pitcher on her arm," <lb/>
            we see intimated the prompt and eager attention of the teacher <lb/>
            to the pupil; for those teachers are foolish who attempt to <lb/>
            regulate their explanations not by a reference to the capacity <lb/>
            of their pupils, but to their own superior ability, not being <lb/>
            aware that there is a vast difference between making a display <lb/>
            and giving a lesson.</p><pb n="319"/>
            
          <p>For he who is making a display, relying on the good fortune <lb/>
            of his present way of proceeding, brings into sight, without any <lb/>
            trouble, the works at which he has for a long while been labour­ <lb/>
            ing at home, like the works of painters or sculptors, seeking <lb/>
            for praise from the multitude. But he who is endeavouring to <lb/>
            teach others, like a good physician, has a regard not to the <lb/>
            greatness of his own skill, but to the capacity of his patient who <lb/>
            is to be healed ; not thinking how much he can do by his art, <lb/>
            for it is unspeakable how much this may be; but what the <lb/>
            patient requires, aiming at moderation, and bringing forward <lb/>
            what may improve him.</p>
          <p>XLIII. On which account Moses says in another passage, <lb/>
            " Thou shalt lend a loan to him who asks you for one, as <lb/>
            much as he requires, having regard to what he requires. '* <lb/>
            By the second phrase showing that it is not everything which <lb/>
            is to be given, but only such things as are suitable to the re­ <lb/>
            quirements of those who are asking for them. For to give an <lb/>
            anchor, or an oar, or a rudder to a husbandman, or ploughs or <lb/>
            a spade to a captain of a ship, or a lyre to a physician, or instru­ <lb/>
            ments suited to manual labour to a musician, would be ridiculous, <lb/>
            unless indeed one ought to offer a thirsty man costly viands, <lb/>
            or a hungry man unmixed wine in abundance, so as to show at <lb/>
            once one's own riches and one's want of humanity, by turning <lb/>
            the souls of one's companions into ridicule.</p>
          <p>The quantity to be given in an act of beneficence is defined <lb/>
            according to due proportion, which is a most useful thing. <lb/>
            For, says Moses, do not give. all that right reason is able <lb/>
            to give, but as much as he who is asking the loan is worthy <lb/>
            to receive. Do you not see that even God does not utter <lb/>
            his oracles, having a regard to their being in proportion to <lb/>
            the magnitude of his own oracular power, but always having <lb/>
            respect to the capacity of those who are to be benefited by <lb/>
            them ? Since who could receive the whole power of the words <lb/>
            of God, which are too mighty for any one to listen to? On <lb/>
            which account those persons appear to speak with great truth, <lb/>
            who say to Moses, “Do thou speak to us, and let not God <lb/>
            speak to us, lest we die." t For they know that they have <lb/>
            not in themselves any organ which can be worthy of God who <lb/>
            is giving laws to his church ; nor, indeed, could even the <lb/>
            whole world; both land and sea, contain his riches if he were <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodii3 xx. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="320"/>
            inclined to display them, unless we think that the descent of the <lb/>
            rains and of the other things that happen in the world are ap­ <lb/>
            pointed to take place according to the pre-arranged periods of <lb/>
            the seasons, and not all at once, because of the scarcity and <lb/>
            rarity of the things themselves, and not from any regard to <lb/>
            the advantage of those who are benefited by them; who <lb/>
            would be injured rather than be benefited by a continual en­ <lb/>
            joyment of such gifts.</p>
          <p>On this account it is, that God always judiciously limits and <lb/>
            brings out with wise moderation his first benefits, stopping <lb/>
            them before those who partake of them become wanton through <lb/>
            satiety ; and then he bestows others in their stead; and again a <lb/>
            third class of advantages instead of the second set, and so on, <lb/>
            continually substituting new blessings for those of older date, <lb/>
            at one time giving such as are different from those which <lb/>
            went before, and at another time such as are almost identical <lb/>
            with them; for the creature is never wholly destitute of the <lb/>
            blessings bestowed by God, since if he were he would be <lb/>
            utterly destroyed; but he is unable to endure an un­ <lb/>
            limited and measureless abundance of them. On which <lb/>
            account, as he is desirous that we should derive advantage <lb/>
            from the benefits which he bestows upon us, he weighs out <lb/>
            what he gives so as to proportion it to the strength of those <lb/>
            who receive it.</p>
          <p>XLIV. Rebekkab, therefore, must be praised, who, in <lb/>
            obedience to the injunctions of her father, having taken down <lb/>
            the vessel of wisdom on her arm from a higher place, proffered <lb/>
            her pitcher to the disciple ; by the pitcher being understood <lb/>
            that teaching which he is competent to receive. And beyond <lb/>
            all other things, I especially admire her exceeding liberality ; <lb/>
            for though she had only been asked for a small draught, she <lb/>
            gave a large one, until she had filled the whole soul of the <lb/>
            learner with wholesome speculations. For Moses says, " She <lb/>
            gave him to drink till he ceased from drinking," a most marvel­ <lb/>
            lous example to teach us humanity. For if any one should <lb/>
            not happen to be in want of many things, but should come <lb/>
            forward, and out of shame ask only for a very little, let us <lb/>
            not give him only what he mentions, but also those things of <lb/>
            which he makes no mention, but of which he is nevertheless in <lb/>
            reality in need. But it is not sufficient for the complete enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of his teacher's lessons, that the disciple should merely <lb/>
             <pb n="321"/>
            comprehend what the master has taught him, unless he has <lb/>
            also got memory. On which account, making a display of her <lb/>
            bounteous disposition, when he has satisfied himself with the <lb/>
            water, she offers to give his camels water also, which we have <lb/>
            already said are here put symbolically for memory. For the <lb/>
            animal while eating its food ruminates, and when, having stooped <lb/>
            down it has received a heavy burden, with exceedingly great <lb/>
            vigour of muscle it rises up lightly; and in the same manner <lb/>
            also, the soul of the man who is devoted to learning, when the <lb/>
            burden of its speculations is placed upon it, becomes more <lb/>
            lowly, and when it has risen up it rejoices; and from the <lb/>
            mastication, and as it were the softening, of the first food that <lb/>
            is placed down before it, arises its memory of those specu­ <lb/>
            lations.</p>
          <p>But she, beholding the nature of the servant to be well <lb/>
            calculated for the reception of virtue, emptied her whole <lb/>
            pitcher into the cistern, that is to say, she emptied the whole <lb/>
            knowledge of the teacher into the soul of the learner. For <lb/>
            the sophists, from a desire of gain and also from envy, re­ <lb/>
            pressing the natural characters of their pupils, keep silence <lb/>
            about many things which ought to be mentioned, laying up for <lb/>
            themselves a source of gain for future times. But virtue is <lb/>
            an ungrudging and most liberal feeling, so that it does not <lb/>
            hesitate to assist another with hand and foot, as the proverb <lb/>
            goes, and with all its power. Therefore, pouring all that she <lb/>
            knew into the mind of the pupil as into a cistern, she went <lb/>
            again to the well to draw water, that is to say, she went to the <lb/>
            ever-flowing wisdom of God, that what had been already <lb/>
            imparted might be firmly fixed in by memory, and that he <lb/>
            might also be irrigated with the knoweldge of other and newer <lb/>
            things. For the wealth of the wisdom of God is illimitable, <lb/>
            and as a tree which is continually putting forth new shoots <lb/>
            after the old ones, so that it never ceases growing young <lb/>
            again, and being in the flower of its strength. So that they <lb/>
            are marvellously simple people who have ever had an idea <lb/>
            of coming to the end of any branch of knowledge whatever. <lb/>
            For that which has seemed to be near and within reach is <lb/>
            nevertheless a long way distant from the end ; since no created <lb/>
            being is perfect in any department of learning, but falls as far <lb/>
            short of it as a thoroughly infant child just beginning to learn <note type="footnote"> Y </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="322"/>
            does, in comparison of a man who both by age and skill is <lb/>
            qualified to be a master.</p>
          <p>XLV. And we must inquire the cause why the handmaid <lb/>
            gave the servant drink from the fountain, but gave the camels <lb/>
            water from the well. May it not perhaps be that the stream <lb/>
            here signifies the sacred scripture itself, which irrigates the <lb/>
            sciences, and that the well is rather akin to memory ? For the <lb/>
            depths which he has already mentioned, he produces by means <lb/>
            of memory as it were out of a well; and such persons as <lb/>
            these one ought to admit because of the goodness of their <lb/>
            natural disposition. But there are some men among those <lb/>
            who practise virtue to whom the all-beneficent God has shown <lb/>
            the way that leads to virtue, such that at first it is accounted <lb/>
            rough, and steep, and difficult, but subsequently level and easy, <lb/>
            having changed the bitterness of the wayfarer's labour to sweet­ <lb/>
            ness. And how he has wrought this change we will now tell. <lb/>
            When he led us forth out of Egypt, that is to say, out of the <lb/>
            passions which excite the body, we, travelling in the desert, <lb/>
            that is to say, in the path of pleasure, encamped in the place <lb/>
            called Marah, a place which had no drinkable water, but where <lb/>
            all the water was bitter.* For still the pleasures which are <lb/>
            brought into action by means of the eyes, and ears, and belly, <lb/>
            and the parts adjacent to the belly, were tempting to us, and <lb/>
            charmed us exceedingly, sounding close to us. When, there­ <lb/>
            fore, we desired to be entirely separated from them, they <lb/>
            dragged us back, exerting themselves in opposition to us, and <lb/>
            entwining themselves round us, and soothing us with all kinds <lb/>
            of juggling tricks and assiduous blandishments; so that we, <lb/>
            yielding to their unremitting caresses, became alienated from <lb/>
            and disinclined to labour, as something very bitter and intole­ <lb/>
            rable, and designed to run back again to Egypt, that is to say, <lb/>
            to the condition of an intemperate aud lascivious life, if the <lb/>
            Saviour had not speedily taken pity on us, and thrown a <lb/>
            sweetening branch like a medicine upon our soul, causing it to <lb/>
            love labour instead of hating it. For he knew, inasmuch as <lb/>
            he was our Creator, that we could not possibly survive any <lb/>
            existing thing unless there were in us an intense love of doing <lb/>
            so. Therefore, men never succeed in attaining any object <lb/>
            that they desire if they pursue it without any connection with <lb/>
            or consideration of fitness. But when friendship is added, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="323"/>
            and also a familiarity with the loved object, their endeavours <lb/>
            then succeed rightly.</p>
          <p>XLVI. This is the food of a soul which is inclined to the <lb/>
            practice of virtue, to consider labour a very sweet thing <lb/>
            instead of a bitter one, which, however, it is not allowed to <lb/>
            all persons to participate in; but to those only by whom the <lb/>
            golden calf, the animal made by the Egyptians, the body, is <lb/>
            sprinkled over with water after having been burnt with fire, <lb/>
            and broken to pieces. For it is said in the sacred scriptures, <lb/>
            that " Moses having taken the calf burnt it with fire, and <lb/>
            broke it up into small pieces, and threw the pieces into the <lb/>
            water, and caused the children of Israel to drink thereof."* <lb/>
            For the love of virtue being inflamed and excited by the <lb/>
            brilliant appearance of virtue, burns to ashes the pleasures of <lb/>
            the body, and then cuts them to pieces and pounds them to <lb/>
            nothing, using the divine word which can at all times divide <lb/>
            everything. And in this manner he teaches us that among <lb/>
            the bodily advantages are health, and beauty, and the accuracy <lb/>
            of the outward senses, and the perfection of bodily vigour <lb/>
            with strength and mighty energy ; but still that all these things <lb/>
            are common to accursed and wicked persons, while if they <lb/>
            were really good no wicked person would be allowed to partake <lb/>
            of them. But these men, even if they are utterly wicked, <lb/>
            still, inasmuch as they are men, and so far partake of the <lb/>
            same human nature as virtuous men, do also partake of these <lb/>
            advantages of the body.</p>
          <p>And, in fact, at present those wild beasts which are the <lb/>
            most untameable, enjoy these good things, if indeed they are <lb/>
            in reality good things. in a greater degree than rational beings ; <lb/>
            for what wrestler could be compared in might with the strength <lb/>
            of a bull or of an elephant ? And what runner could put him­ <lb/>
            self on a level with the speed of a hound or of a hare ? And <lb/>
            the most sharp-sighted of men is absolutely blind if his sight <lb/>
            is compared with that of antelopes or eagles. Again, in hearing <lb/>
            and in smell, often other animals are very far beyond man ; as, <lb/>
            for instance, the ass, which appears to be the stupidest of all <lb/>
            animals, would show that our sense of hearing is very obtuse if <lb/>
            he were brought into comparison with us. The do,,, too, would <lb/>
            make the nostrils in man appear a perfectly useless part from <lb/>
            the exceeding superiority of the quickness of his own sense of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxii. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> Y 2</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="324"/>
            smell; for. in him. that sense is pushed to such a degree that <lb/>
            it almost equals the rapidity of the eye-sight.</p>
          <p>XLYII. And why need I dwell on the subject more, going- <lb/>
            through each of the senses and animals separately ? For this <lb/>
            point has been long agreed upon among all the most eminent <lb/>
            historians and philosophers, who have all said that nature is <lb/>
            the mother of the irrational animals, and the step-mother of <lb/>
            men. perceiving the bodily weakness of men. and the surpass­ <lb/>
            ing strength of brute animals in everything. With great pro­ <lb/>
            priety. therefore, the artist pounded the calf to pieces ; that is <lb/>
            to say, dividing it into parts, he showed that all the things <lb/>
            which the body has in abundance are very far removed from <lb/>
            real good. and are in no respect different from those things <lb/>
            which are scattered on the water. On which account the scrip­ <lb/>
            ture tells ns that the calf, afterhaving been pounded to pieces, was <lb/>
            scattered on the water, to signify that no genuine plant of good <lb/>
            can ever flourish in corruptible, matter ; for as a seed, when <lb/>
            thrown into the stream of a river or into the sea, cannot dis­ <lb/>
            play its proper powers ; for it is impossible, unless it has once <lb/>
            taken hold with its roots, as with anchors, of some firm portion <lb/>
            of earth, that any branch should be firmly fixed or should shoot <lb/>
            up. I do not say to any height, but even as a creeper along the <lb/>
            ground, or that it should ever bring forth fruit at the periodical <lb/>
            seasons of the year, for any great and violent rush of water <lb/>
            coming on washes away all the germinating vigour of the seed. <lb/>
            In the same manner all the superfluities contained in the <lb/>
            vessel of the soul which are ever spoken of or celebrated are <lb/>
            destroyed before they can have any existence, the corporeal <lb/>
            substance continually flowing off from them. For how can <lb/>
            there be such things as disease and old age and all kinds of <lb/>
            corruption-,-, if there were not a continual drawing off of words, <lb/>
            which are theoretical streams : the hierophant, therefore, thinks <lb/>
            it right* to irrigate our minds with these words, for the sake <lb/>
            of burning up the pleasures, of pounding to pieces and re­ <lb/>
            ducing to a thin and impalpable dust, and utterly destroying the <lb/>
            system of the corporeal goods; and of making us recollect that <lb/>
            the true good has never at any time germinated or blossomed <lb/>
            from any one of them, just as nothing flourishes from seeds <lb/>
            which are sown in water. <note type="footnote"> of. I have followed Mangey here in reading <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀξιοῑ</foreign>, instead of <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὰπαξιοῑ</foreign>, <lb/>

          <p>XLVIII. But bulls, and rams, and goats, which Egypt <lb/>
            bolds in honour, and all other images of corruptible matter <lb/>
            which, in report alone, are accounted God's, have no real <lb/>
            existence, but are all fictitious and false; for those who look <lb/>
            upon life as only a tragedy full of acts of arrogance and stories <lb/>
            of love, impressing false ideas on the tender minds of young <lb/>
            men, and using the ears as their ministers, into which they <lb/>
            pour fabulous trifles, waste away and corrupt their minds, <lb/>
            compelling them to look upon persons who were never even <lb/>
            men in their minds, but always effeminate creatures as God's ; <lb/>
            for the calf was not made of every description of female orna­ <lb/>
            ment, but only of the earrings of the women. The lawgiver <lb/>
            showing us by this that nothing wrought with hands is a <lb/>
            visible and true God, but only so by report, and as far as he is <lb/>
            thought so, and that, too, the report of a woman and not of a <lb/>
            man ; for it is the conduct of a soul utterly enervated and ren <lb/>
            dered completely effeminate to receive such nonsense.</p>
          <p>But he who is truly God is perceived, and felt, and recog­ <lb/>
            nised, not only by means of one's ears, but also by the eyes of <lb/>
            our mind, through his mighty works which are done in the <lb/>
            world, and through the rapidity of his operations; on which <lb/>
            account in the great song it is said (the speaker as­ <lb/>
            suming the character of God), "Behold ! behold! it is I! "* <lb/>
            as if that real existing God could be more easily conceived Iv <lb/>
            the mind than proved by verbal demonstration; but it is not <lb/>
            correct to say that the living God is visible, that is rather an <lb/>
            abuse of language, arising from referring God himself to his <lb/>
            separate acts of power ; for even in the passage cited above, be <lb/>
            does not say, " Behold me," for it is wholly impossible that <lb/>
            God according to his essence should be perceived or beheld bv <lb/>
            any creature, but he says, " Behold ! it is I," that is to say, <lb/>
            behold my existence; for it is sufficient for the reasoning <lb/>
            powers of man to advance so far as to learn that there is and <lb/>
            actually exists the great cause of all things, and to attempt to <lb/>
            proceed further, so as to pursue investigations into the essence <lb/>
            or distinctive qualities of God, is an absolute piece of folly ; <lb/>
            for God did not grant this even to the all-wise Moses; not <lb/>
            though he addressed innumerable requests to him, all having <lb/>
            this object; but an oracle was delivered to him, telling him, <lb/>
            " Thou shalt see my back parts, but my face thou shalt not <note type="footnote"> Deuteronomy xxxii 39. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="326"/>
            see ; "* and the meaning of this is, that all the things which <lb/>
            are behind God are within the comprehension of a virtuous <lb/>
            man, but he himself alone is incomprehensible; and he is <lb/>
            incomprehensible by any direct and immediate access (for by <lb/>
            such means it is only explained what kind of being he is), but <lb/>
            he may be understood in his subsequent and consistent <lb/>
            faculties; for they, by means of the works accomplished by <lb/>
            them, declare not his essence, but his existence.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Therefore the mind having generated the foun­ <lb/>
            dation of good ....f and the primary principle of virtue, <lb/>
            namely Seth, or irrigation, boasts with an honourable and <lb/>
            holy boast; for she says, " God has raised up to me another <lb/>
            seed, instead of Abel whom Cain slew,"t for it has been said <lb/>
            with great exactness and neatness, that no single divine seed <lb/>
            ever falls to the ground, but that they all rise up from the <lb/>
            things of earth, and leave them, and are borne upwards to <lb/>
            heaven; but the seeds which are sown by mortals, whether <lb/>
            for the generation of animals or of plants, do not all come to <lb/>
            perfection; but we must be content if more are not wasted <lb/>
            than those which remain above ; and God sows nothing in our <lb/>
            souls which is incomplete ; but his seed is all so seasonable <lb/>
            and so perfect that every one of them is at once borne forward <lb/>
            to produce abundance of its appropriate fruit.</p>
          <p>L. But when Moses says here that Seth sprung up as <lb/>
            another or different seed, he does not say from which it was <lb/>
            different; was it different from Abel who was treacherously <lb/>
            slain, or from Cain who slew him ? But may we not say <lb/>
            perhaps that the original seed from which each of these <lb/>
            sprung was different ? That from which Cain sprung, in­ <lb/>
            asmuch as it was hostile; for a thirst for virtue is the most <lb/>
            hostile thing possible to that deserter, wickedness; that from <lb/>
            which Abel sprung, as friendly and kindred ; for that which <lb/>
            is beginning to exist is a different thing from, but not a <lb/>
            contrary thing to, that which is perfected ; and so that which <lb/>
            pertains to creation is different from that which pertains to <lb/>
            the uncreate.</p>
          <p>On this account Abel, after having quitted the mortal body, <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 23. </note><note type="footnote"> f There is again a hiatus in the text here. Mangey conjectures <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">διαγωγη̃ς</foreign>, "way of life," to be the word which has fallen out. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iv. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="327"/>
            departed to the better nature, and took up his abode with <lb/>
            that. But Seth, as being the seed of human virtue, will <lb/>
            never quit the race of mankind. But first of all he will <lb/>
            receive his growth up to the number ten, that perfect number, <lb/>
            according to which the just Noah exists; and then he will <lb/>
            receive a second and a better growth from his son Shorn, end­ <lb/>
            ing in a second ten, from which the faithful Abraham is <lb/>
            named. And he will also have a third growth, and one more <lb/>
            perfect than the number ten, extending from him to Moses, <lb/>
            that man who is wise in all things, for he is the seventh from <lb/>
            Abraham, not revolving, like an initiated worshipper, in the <lb/>
            circle which is exterior to holy things, but like a hierophant, <lb/>
            making his abode in the inmost shrines.</p>
          <p>LI. And consider the advances towards improvement made <lb/>
            by the soul of the man who is eager for, and insatiable in, his <lb/>
            craving after good things; and the illimitable riches of God, <lb/>
            who gives the end of some things to be the beginnings of <lb/>
            others; for the end of the knowledge which is according to <lb/>
            Seth is the beginning of the just Noah ; and his perfection <lb/>
            again is the beginning of the education of Abraham; and the <lb/>
            most perfect wisdom of Abraham is the first instruction of <lb/>
            Moses; and the two daughters of Lot, the man who was sub­ <lb/>
            dued and overthrown by the weakness of the soul, namely, <lb/>
            intention and agreement, desire to become pregnant by the <lb/>
            mind, that is to say, by their father, acting in opposition to <lb/>
            him who said, " God has raised up for me ...For that <lb/>
            which the living God did for him, this they affirm that the <lb/>
            mind is able to do for them, introducing the doctrine of an <lb/>
            intoxicated and frenzied soul.</p>
          <p>It is indeed the act of sober reason, both to confess that <lb/>
            God is the Creator and the Father of the universe; and the <lb/>
            conduct of one utterly fallen in intoxication and drunkenness, <lb/>
            to fancy that he himself is the bringer about of each of human <lb/>
            affairs. Evil opinions therefore will not come into association <lb/>
            with their father, before a great quantity of the unmixed wine <lb/>
            of folly has been found upon him, and destroyed any sense that <lb/>
            may have previously been in him; for it is written, " They <lb/>
            made their father drink wine." So that if they do not give <lb/>
            him diink, they will never receive legitimate seed from him <lb/>
            while he is sober; but when he has been soaked in wine, and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xix. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="328"/>
            has become utterly intoxicated and senseless, then they will <lb/>
            become pregnant, and have a culpable labour and offspring, <lb/>
            which will be truly accursed.</p>
          <p>LII. On which account Moses has separated his impious and <lb/>
            obscure progeny from the whole of the divine company; for he <lb/>
            says, " The Ammonites and the Moabites shall not come into <lb/>
            the assembly of the Lord :"* and these are the descendants of <lb/>
            the daughters of Lot, supposing that everything is generated of <lb/>
            the outward sense and of mind, being male and female like a <lb/>
            father and mother, and looking upon this as in real truth the <lb/>
            cause of all generation : but as, even if we were to commit such <lb/>
            an error as this, still emerging as it were out of that troubled set, <lb/>
            we may lay hold on repentance, which is a firm and saving thing, <lb/>
            and must never let it go till we have completely escaped from <lb/>
            the billowy sea, the headlong violence of sin : as Rachel, when <lb/>
            formerly praying for mind, as if that were able to raise up chil­ <lb/>
            dren, and when she received the answer, "Am I equal to God?"‡ <lb/>
            attended to what was said to her, and when she understood it, <lb/>
            made a most pious recantation; for the recantation of Ra­ <lb/>
            chel is recorded in scripture, a most God-loving prayer, "May <lb/>
            God grant to me another son,"‡ such a prayer as no foolish <lb/>
            person is permitted to make, who pursues no object but his <lb/>
            own pleasure, and who thinks everything else mere folly and <lb/>
            ridiculousness.</p>
          <p>LIII. And the leader of this opinion is Onan the brother of <lb/>
            the skin-wearing Er. " For he," says the scripture, " knowing <lb/>
            that the seed would not be his, when he went in unto his brother's <lb/>
            wife, spilled his seed upon the ground :"§ he transgressed all the <lb/>
            boundaries of self-love and of fondness for pleasure. Should I <lb/>
            not say to this man, If you have a regard to your own advantage <lb/>
            you will destroy everything that is excellent, and that too with­ <lb/>
            out deriving any advantage therefrom? You will put an end to <lb/>
            the honour due to parents, the attention of a wife, the education <lb/>
            of children, the blameless services of servants, the management <lb/>
            of a house, the government of a city, the firm establishment of <lb/>
            laws, the guardianship of morals, reverence to one's elders, the <lb/>
            habit of speaking well of the dead, good fellowship with the <lb/>
            living, piety towards God as shown both in words and in deeds : <lb/>
            for you are overturning and throwing into confusion all these <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxiii. 3. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxx. 24. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxx. 2. </note><note type="footnote"> $ Genesis xxxviii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="329"/>
            things, sowing seed for yourself alone, and nursing up pleasure, <lb/>
            that gluttonous intemperate origin of all evil.</p>
          <p>LIV. From which that priest and servant of the only good <lb/>
            God, Phineas, rising up*—that wise regulator of all the corpo­ <lb/>
            real words and expressions, so as never to behave erroneously or <lb/>
            insolently through the medium of them ; for the interpretation <lb/>
            of the name Phineas is the bridle of the mouth"—having taken <lb/>
            a coadjutor, that is to say, having inquired into and examined <lb/>
            the nature of things, and having found that nothing is more <lb/>
            honourable than virtue, stabbed and slew with a sword the crea­ <lb/>
            ture devoted to pleasure, and hostile to virtue, and all the places <lb/>
            from which all false and illegitimate delights and enjoyments <lb/>
            spring : for the law says that, " he thrust the woman through <lb/>
            her belly."</p>
          <p>Thus, therefore, having caused the difference that existed in <lb/>
            him to cease, and having discarded his own pleasure, and burn­ <lb/>
            ing with zeal for God, the First Cause and holy God, he was <lb/>
            honoured and crowned with the two most valuable of all prizes, <lb/>
            peace and the priesthood; with the one because both his name <lb/>
            and his conduct are akin to peace : for it follows of necessity that <lb/>
            a consecrated mind, being its minister and servant, must do <lb/>
            everything in which its master delights ; and he delights in the <lb/>
            firm establishment of good law, and tranquillity, and stability, <lb/>
            and in the discarding of wars and .† meaning not only <lb/>
            such as cities make upon one another, but also those which take <lb/>
            place in the soul; and these are more important and more inju­ <lb/>
            rious, inasmuch as they injure the more divine portion of us, <lb/>
            namely, our reason, while arms and weapons can only reach to <lb/>
            the injury of our bodies or possessions, but have never any power <lb/>
            to injure a healthy soul.</p>
          <p>Rightly therefore have cities established a custom, that before <lb/>
            they turn arms and engines of destruction against one another <lb/>
            to lead to slavery and utter destruction, they should seek to per­ <lb/>
            suade all the citizens to put an‡ end to the great and formidable <lb/>
            and unceasing factions which exist in themselves, for faction <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxv. 11. </note><note type="footnote"> + There is another hiatus here, which Mangey proposes to fill up <lb/>

            of wars, and if that be destroyed, there will no longer be any wars <lb/>
            which are made in imitation of it; but the race of mankind will <lb/>
            attain to the blessing and enjoyment of profound peace, being <lb/>
            taught by the law of nature, that is, by virtue, to honour God, <lb/>
            and to cleave to the employment of serving him, for this is the <lb/>
            source of happiness and length of life,</p>

          <p>I. "AND it came to pass when there began to be manv men <lb/>
            upon the earth, that daughters also were born to them."* I <lb/>
            think it here worth while to raise the question why, after the <lb/>
            birth of Noah and his sons, our race increased to a degree of <lb/>
            great populousness. But, perhaps, it is not difficult to explain <lb/>
            the cause of this ; for it always happens if anything appears to <lb/>
            be rare that its contrary is found exceedingly numerous. <lb/>
            Therefore, the good disposition of one displays the evil disposi­ <lb/>
            tion of myriads, and the fact of those things which are done in <lb/>
            accordance with art, and science, and virtue, and beauty, being <lb/>
            few, shows how incalculable a number of things devoid of art, <lb/>
            and of science, and of justice, and, in short, utterly worthless, <lb/>
            lie concealed beneath. Do you not see that in the universe, <lb/>
            also, the sun, being one body, by his shining forth dissipates <lb/>
            the thick and dense darkness which is shed over earth and sea? <lb/>
            With great propriety, therefore, the generation of the just <lb/>
            Noah and his sons is represented as bringing into existence a <lb/>
            great number of unjust persons; for it is by the contrary that <lb/>
            it is especially the nature of contraries to be known. And no <lb/>
            unjust man at any time implants a masculine generation in <lb/>
            the soul, but such, being unmanly, and broken, and effeminate <lb/>
            in their minds, do naturally become the parents of female <lb/>
            children ; having planted no tree of virtue, the fruit of which <lb/>
            must of necessity have been beautiful and salutary, but only <lb/>
            trees of wickedness and of the passions, the shoots of which are <lb/>
            womanlike.</p>
          <p>On account, of which fact these men are said to have become <lb/>
            the fathers of daughters, and that no one of them is said to <lb/>
            and sedition, if we must speak the truth, is the archetypal model <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vL 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="331"/>
            have begotten a son; for since the just Noah had male chil­ <lb/>
            dren, as being a mail who followed reason, perfect, and upright, <lb/>
            and masculine, so by this very fact the injustice of the multi­ <lb/>
            tude is proved to be altogether the parent of female children. <lb/>
            For it is impossible that the same things should be born of <lb/>
            opposite parents ; but they must necessarily have an opposite <lb/>
            offspring.</p>
          <p>II. " And when the angels of God saw the daughters of <lb/>
            men that they were beautiful, they took unto themselves wives <lb/>
            of all of them whom they chose."* Those beings, whom other <lb/>
            philosophers call demons, Moses usually calls angels; and they <lb/>
            are souls hovering in the air. And let no one suppose, that <lb/>
            what is here stated is a fable, for it is necessarily true that the <lb/>
            universe must be filled with living things in all its parts, since <lb/>
            every one of'its primary and elementary portions contains its <lb/>
            appropriate animals and such as are consistent with its nature ; <lb/>
            -the earth containing terrestrial animals, the sea and the <lb/>
            rivers containing aquatic animals, and the fire such as are born <lb/>
            in the fire (but it is said, that such as these last are found <lb/>
            chiefly in Macedonia), and the heaven containing the stars; <lb/>
            for these also are entire souls pervading the universe, being <lb/>
            unadulterated and divine, inasmuch as they move in a circle, <lb/>
            which is the kind of motion most akin to the mind, for every <lb/>
            one of them is the parent mind.</p>
          <p>It is therefore necessary that the air also should be full of <lb/>
            living beings. And these beings are invisible to us, inasmuch <lb/>
            as the air itself is not visible to mortal sight. But it does not <lb/>
            follow, because our sight is incapable of perceiving the forms <lb/>
            of souls, that for that reason there are no souls in the air ; but <lb/>
            it follows of necessity that they must be comprehended by the <lb/>
            mind, in order that like may be contemplated by like. Since <lb/>
            what shall we say? Must we not say that these animals <lb/>
            which are terrestrial or aquatic live in air and spirit? What? <lb/>
            Are not pestilential afflictions accustomed to exist when the <lb/>
            air is tainted or corrupted, as if that were the cause of all such <lb/>
            assuming vitality ? Again, when the air is free from all taint <lb/>
            and innocent, such as it is especially wont to be when the north <lb/>
            wind prevails, does not the imbibing of a purer air tend to a <lb/>
            more vigorous and more lasting duration of life ? It is then <lb/>
            natural that that medium by which all other animals, whether <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="332"/>
            aquatic or terrestrial, are vivified should itself be empty and <lb/>
            destitute of souls ? On the contrary, even if all other animals <lb/>
            were barren, the air by itself would be bound to be productive <lb/>
            of life, having received from the great Creator the seeds of <lb/>
            vitality by his especial favour.</p>
          <p>III. Some souls, therefore, have descended into bodies, and <lb/>
            others have not thought worthy to approach any one of the <lb/>
            portions of the earth ; and these, when hallowed and sur. <lb/>
            rounded by the ministrations of the father, the Creator has <lb/>
            been accustomed to employ, as hand-maidens and servants in <lb/>
            the administration of mortal affairs. And they having de­ <lb/>
            scended into the body as into a river, at one time are carried <lb/>
            away and swallowed up by the voracity of a most violent whirl­ <lb/>
            pool ; and, at another time, striving with all their power to <lb/>
            resist its impetuosity, they at first swim on the top of it, and <lb/>
            afterwards fly back to the place from which they started.</p>
          <p>These, then, are the souls of those who have been taught <lb/>
            some kind of sublime philosophy, meditating, from beginning <lb/>
            to end, on dying as to the life of the body, in order to obtain an <lb/>
            inheritance of the incorporeal and imperishable life, which is to <lb/>
            be enjoyed in the presence of the uncreate and everlasting <lb/>
            God. But those, which are swallowed up in the whirlpool, are <lb/>
            the souls of those other men who have disregarded wisdom, <lb/>
            giving themselves up to the pursuit of unstable things regu­ <lb/>
            lated by fortune alone, not one of which is referred to the most <lb/>
            excellent portion of us, the soul or the mind ; but all rather to <lb/>
            the dead corpse connected with us, that is to the body, or to <lb/>
            things which are even more lifeless than that, such as glory, <lb/>
            and money, and offices, and honours, and all other things <lb/>
            which, by those who do not keep their eyes fixed on what is <lb/>
            really beautiful, are fashioned and endowed with apparent <lb/>
            vitality by the deceit of vain opinion.</p>
          <p>IV. If, therefore, you consider that souls, and demons, and <lb/>
            angels are things differing indeed in name, but one and iden­ <lb/>
            tical in reality, you will then be able to discard that most <lb/>
            heavy burden, superstition. But as men in general speak of <lb/>
            good and evil demons, and in like manner of good and evil <lb/>
            souls, so also do they speak of angels, looking upon some as <lb/>
            worthy of a good appellation, and calling them ambassadors of <lb/>
            man to God, and of God to man, and sacred and holy on <lb/>
            account of this blameless and most excellent office; others, <lb/>
             <pb n="333"/>
            again, you will not err if you look upon as unholy and unworthy <lb/>
            of any address. And the expression used by the writer of the <lb/>
            psalms, in the following verse, testifies to the truth of my <lb/>
            assertion, for he says, " He sent upon them the fury of His <lb/>
            wrath, anger, and rage, and affliction, and he sent evil angels <lb/>
            among them."* These are the wicked who, assuming the <lb/>
            name of angels, not being acquainted with the daughters of <lb/>
            right reason, that is with the sciences and the virtues, but <lb/>
            which pursue the mortal descendants of mortal men, that is <lb/>
            the pleasures, which can confer no genuine beauty, which is <lb/>
            perceived by the intellect alone, but only a bastard sort of <lb/>
            elegance of form, by means of which the outward sense is <lb/>
            beguiled; and they do not all take all the daughters in mar­ <lb/>
            riage, but some of them have selected some of that innumerable <lb/>
            company to be their wives ; some choosing them by the sight, <lb/>
            and others by the ear, others again being influenced by the <lb/>
            sense of taste, or by the belly, and some even by the pleasures <lb/>
            below the belly; many also have laid hold of those the abode <lb/>
            of which is fixed at a great distance, putting in action various <lb/>
            desires among one another. For, of necessity, the choices of <lb/>
            all the various pleasures are various, since different pleasures <lb/>
            are established in different places.</p>
          <p>V. And, in all such matters, it is impossible for the spirit of <lb/>
            God to remain and to pass all its time, as the law-giver him­ <lb/>
            self shows. " For," says Moses, " the Lord said, My spirit <lb/>
            shall not remain among men for ever, because they are flesh, "† <lb/>
            For, at times, it does remain ; but it does not remain for ever <lb/>
            and ever among the greater part of us ; for who is so destitute <lb/>
            of reason or so lifeless as never, either voluntarily or involunta­ <lb/>
            rily, to conceive a notion of the all good God. For, very often, <lb/>
            even over the most polluted and accursed beings, there hovers <lb/>
            a sudden appearance of the good, but they are unable to take <lb/>
            firm hold of it and to keep it among them ; for, almost imme­ <lb/>
            diately, it quits its former place and departs, rejecting those <lb/>
            inhabitants who come over to it, and who live in defiance of law <lb/>
            and justice, to whom it never would have come if it had not <lb/>
            been for the sake of convicting those who choose what is dis­ <lb/>
            graceful instead of what is good.</p>
          <p>But the spirit of God is spoken of in one manner as being <lb/>
            air flowing upon the earth, bringing a third element in addition <note type="footnote"> * Psalm lxxvii. 49. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis vi. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="334"/>
            to water. In reference to which. Moses says, in his account <lb/>
            of the creation of the world, " The spirit of God moved upon <lb/>
            the face of the waters."* Since the air, as it is very light, is <lb/>
            raised and borne aloft, having water, as it were, for its founda­ <lb/>
            tion ; and, in another manner, unalloyed knowledge is said to <lb/>
            be so, which every wise man naturally partakes of. And <lb/>
            Moses shows us this, when speaking of the creator and maker <lb/>
            of the holy work of the creation, in these words : " And God <lb/>
            summoned Bezaleel, and filled him with his Holy Spirit, <lb/>
            and with wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge, to be <lb/>
            able to devise every work."† So that, what the spirit of God <lb/>
            is, is very definitively described in these words.</p>
          <p>VI. Such also is the spirit of Moses, which came upon the <lb/>
            seventy elders, for the sake of making them differ from, and <lb/>
            be superior to the rest of the Israelites, who could not possibly <lb/>
            be elders in real truth, unless they had partaken of that all­ <lb/>
            wise spirit. For it is said, " I will take of my spirit which is <lb/>
            upon thee, and I will pour it upon the seventy elders." ‡ But <lb/>
            think not that thus this taking away, could be by means of <lb/>
            cutting off or separation; but it is here, as is the case in an <lb/>
            operation effected by fire, which can light ten thousand torches, <lb/>
            without itself being diminished the least atom, or ceasing to <lb/>
            remain as it was before. Something like this also is the <lb/>
            nature of knowledge. For though it has made all its pupils, <lb/>
            and all who have become acquainted with it, learned, still it is <lb/>
            in no degree diminished itself, but very often it even becomes <lb/>
            improved, just as, they say, that fountains sometimes are by <lb/>
            being drained dry ; for, it is said, that they sometimes become <lb/>
            sweeter by such a process.</p>
          <p>For continual association with others, engendering diligence <lb/>
            and practice, gradually works out entire perfection. If, then, <lb/>
            the individual spirit of Moses, or of any other creature, was about <lb/>
            to be distributed to so great a multitude of pupils, then, if it <lb/>
            were divided into such a number of small portions, it would be <lb/>
            diminished. But now, the spirit which is upon him is the wise, <lb/>
            the divine, the indivisible, the undistributable, the good spirit, <lb/>
            the spirit which is everywhere diffused, so as to fill the uni­ <lb/>
            verse, which, while it benefits others, is not injured by having <lb/>
            a participation in it given to another, and if added to some­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis i. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxi 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xi. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="335"/>
            thing else, either as to its understanding, or its knowledge, or <lb/>
            its wisdom.</p>
          <p>VII. On which account, it is possible that the spirit of God <lb/>
            may remain in the soul, but that it should remain for ever is <lb/>
            impossible, as we have said. And why need we wonder ? <lb/>
            since there is no other thing whatever, the possession of <lb/>
            which, is stable and lasting ; but mortal affairs are continually <lb/>
            wavering in the scale, and inclining first to one side, and then <lb/>
            to the other, and liable at different times to different changes. <lb/>
            And the greatest cause of our ignorance is the flesh, and our <lb/>
            inseparable connection with the flesh. And this, Moses repre­ <lb/>
            sents God as admitting, where he says that, " Because they are <lb/>
            flesh," the spirit of God cannot abide in them. And yet marriage <lb/>
            and the rearing of children, and the furnishing of necessary <lb/>
            things, and ingloriousness conjoined with a want of money and <lb/>
            business, both private and public, and a countless number of <lb/>
            other things cause wisdom to waste away, before it begins to <lb/>
            flourish vigorously. But there is nothing which is so great a <lb/>
            hindrance to its growth as the fleshly nature. For that, as if <lb/>
            it were the principal and most solid foundation of folly and <lb/>
            ignorance, is laid down firmly, and then each of the afore­ <lb/>
            named evils is built up upon it.</p>
          <p>For those souls which are devoid of flesh and of the body, <lb/>
            remaining undisturbed in the theatre of the universe, occu­ <lb/>
            pied in seeing and hearing divine things, of which an insatiable <lb/>
            desire has seized them, enjoy a pleasure to which no one <lb/>
            offers any interruption. But those which bear the heavy <lb/>
            burden of the flesh, being weighed down and oppressed by it, <lb/>
            are unable to look upwards to the revolutions of the heaven, <lb/>
            but being dragged downwards, have their necks <unclear>forcibly</unclear> <lb/>
            pressed to the ground like so many quadrupeds.</p>
          <p>VIII. In reference to which fact, the lawgiver having <lb/>
            determined to put an end to all illegal and illegitimate asso­ <lb/>
            ciations and unions, begins his denunciations in the following <lb/>
            manner: " Man shall not come near to any one who is akin <lb/>
            to his own flesh, to uncover his nakedness : I am the Lord."* <lb/>
            How could any one more forcibly exhort man to despise the <lb/>
            flesh and what is akin to the flesh than in this way ? And <lb/>
            indeed he does not only exhort us to abandon such things, but <lb/>
            he shows positively that he who is really a man will never <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xviii. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="336"/>
            come of his own accord to those pleasures which are dear to <lb/>
            and connected with the body, but will always be meditating to <lb/>
            alienate himself from them entirely. For the saying, "man, <lb/>
            man," not once but twice, is a sign that what is here meant is <lb/>
            not the mail composed of body and soul, but him only who is <lb/>
            possessed of virtue. For such an one is really a true man, <lb/>
            whom some one of the ancient philosophers having lighted a <lb/>
            lantern at midday, went in search of, and told those who asked <lb/>
            him that he was seeking a man. And as for the prohibition <lb/>
            against every man coming near to any one who is akin to his <lb/>
            own flesh, this is induced by necessary reasons. For there <lb/>
            are some things which we should admit, such for instance as <lb/>
            those useful things, by the employment of which we may be <lb/>
            able to live in freedom from disease and in good health ; and <lb/>
            there are other things which should be rejected, by which, <lb/>
            when the appetites become inflamed, they burn up all goodness <lb/>
            in one vast conflagration.</p>
          <p>Let not then our appetites rush eagerly in pursuit of all the <lb/>
            things that are pleasant to the flesh, for the pleasures are often <lb/>
            untameable, when like dogs they fawn upon us, and all of a <lb/>
            sudden, change and bite us, inflicting incurable wounds. So <lb/>
            that by cleaving to frugality, which is a friend to virtue, in <lb/>
            preference to the pleasures akin to the body, we shall defeat <lb/>
            the numerous and infinite multitude of irreconcilable enemies. <lb/>
            And if any occasion should seek to compel us to take more <lb/>
            than what is moderate or sufficient, let us not yield; for the <lb/>
            scripture saith, " He shall come near to him to uncover his <lb/>
            nakedness."</p>
          <p>IX. And what is meant by this, it is worth while to explain. <lb/>
            It has often happened, that some who have not been them­ <lb/>
            selves providers of wealth, have nevertheless had unlimited <lb/>
            abundance. And others, who have not been eager in the <lb/>
            pursuit of glory have been thought worthy of public praises and <lb/>
            honours. Others again, who have not expected to acquire <lb/>
            even a little strength, have arrived at the greatest vigour <lb/>
            and activity. Now, let all these men learn not to cleave in <lb/>
            their minds to any one of these qualities ; that is to say, not to <lb/>
            admire them and grasp at them in an immoderate degree, <lb/>
            looking upon them all, that is to say on riches, on glory, and on <lb/>
            bodily strength, not only not as intrinsically good, but as the <lb/>
            greatest of evils. For to misers, the pursuit of money is ap­ <lb/>
             <pb n="337"/>
            propriate, and the pursuit of glory is so to ambitious men, and <lb/>
            the acquisition of bodily strength is so to men fond of athletic <lb/>
            and of gymnastic exercises. For that which is the better part <lb/>
            of them, namely, the soul, they have abandoned as a slave to <lb/>
            those things which are inferior to themselves, namely, to inani­ <lb/>
            mate things.</p>
          <p>But as many as are masters of themselves show that all <lb/>
            that brilliant prosperity, which is an object of so much con­ <lb/>
            tention, is in subordination to the mind, which is the prin­ <lb/>
            cipal part of them, receiving it when it comes, so as to make <lb/>
            a good use of it, but not pursuing it if it keeps aloof, as being <lb/>
            able to be happy even without it. But he who pursues it <lb/>
            eagerly and follows upon its track, fills philosophy with base <lb/>
            opinions ; on which account he is said to uncover its nakedness, <lb/>
            for how can there be any concealment or ignorance of the <lb/>
            reproaches to which those men are justly exposed, who profess <lb/>
            indeed to be wise men, but who make a traffic of wisdom, and <lb/>
            bargain for the sale of it, as they say men do 'in the market, <lb/>
            who put up their wares for sale, sometimes for a slight gain, <lb/>
            sometimes for sweet and caressing speeches, and sometimes <lb/>
            for insecure hopes, founded on no sure ground, and sometimes <lb/>
            even for promises which are in no respect better than dreams.</p>
          <p>X. And the sentence which follows, “I am the Lord," is <lb/>
            uttered with great beauty and with most excessive propriety, <lb/>
            " for," says the Lord, " oppose, my good man, the good of the <lb/>
            flesh to that of the soul, and of the whole man ;” therefore the <lb/>
            pleasure of the flesh is irrational, but the pleasure of the soul <lb/>
            and of the whole man is the mind of the universe, namely <lb/>
            God; and the comparison is an admirable one, and one <lb/>
            difficult to be instituted, so as for any one to be deceived by <lb/>
            the close similitude, unless any one will say that living things <lb/>
            are in reality the same as lifeless things, rational things the <lb/>
            same as irrational things; well adapted the same as those <lb/>
            ill adapted ; odd numbers identical with even ones ; light with <lb/>
            darkness, and day with night; and in short every thing that is <lb/>
            contrary the same as its contrary.</p>
          <p>And yet even although these things have some kind of union <lb/>
            and connection together by reason of their being created, still <lb/>
            God is not in any respect like the very best of created beings, <lb/>
            inasmuch as these have been born, and are liable to suf­ <note type="footnote"> z </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="338"/>
            fering; but he is uncreated, and always acting not suffering. <lb/>
            Now it is well not to desert the ranks of God, in which it <lb/>
            follows inevitably that all who are arrayed must be most ex­ <lb/>
            cellent, and it would be shameful to quit those ranks, to fly <lb/>
            to unmanly and effeminate pleasure, which injures its friends <lb/>
            and benefits its enemies, for its nature is a very singular one; <lb/>
            for all those to whom it chooses to give a share of its special <lb/>
            advantages, it at once chastises and injures ; and those whom <lb/>
            it thinks fit to deprive of its good things, it benefits in the <lb/>
            greatest possible degree, for it injures them when it gives, but <lb/>
            it benefits them when it takes away.</p>
          <p>If therefore, 0 my soul, any one of the temptations of <lb/>
            pleasure invites you, turn yourself away, and directing your <lb/>
            views towards another point, look at the genuine beauty of <lb/>
            virtue, and having surveyed it, remain, until a desire for it <lb/>
            has sunk into you, and draws you to it, like a magnet, and <lb/>
            immediately leads you and attaches you to that which has <lb/>
            become the object of your desire.</p>
          <p>XII. And the expression, "I am the Lord," must be <lb/>
            listened to, not only as if it were equivalent to, "I am the <lb/>
            perfect, and incorruptible, and true good," with which if any one <lb/>
            is surrounded he will reject all that is imperfect, and corrupt­ <lb/>
            ible, and attached to the flesh; but also as equivalent to, <lb/>
            "I am the ruler, and the king, and the master." And it is not <lb/>
            safe for subjects to do wrong in the presence of their rulers, <lb/>
            nor for slaves to err before their masters ; for when the <lb/>
            punishers are near, those whose nature is not quick at sub­ <lb/>
            mitting to admonitions are held in restraint and order by <lb/>
            fear; for God, having filled everything with himself, is near at <lb/>
            hand, so that he is looking over everything and standing by, <lb/>
            we being filled with a great and holy reverence, or if not with <lb/>
            that, at all events, having a prudent fear of the might of his <lb/>
            authority, and of the fearful nature of his punishment, which <lb/>
            cannot be avoided, whenever he determines to exert his <lb/>
            punishing power, shall desist from doing wrong. In order <lb/>
            that the divine spirit of wisdom may not be inclined to quit <lb/>
            our neighbourhood and depart, but that it may remain a very <lb/>
            long time with us, as it did also with the wise Moses; for <lb/>
            Moses is a being of the most tranquil habits, either stand­ <lb/>
            ing still or sitting still, and not at all disposed by nature <lb/>
            to subject himself to turns and changes; for the scripture says, <lb/>
             <pb n="339"/>
            “Moses and the ark did not move,"* inasmuch as the wise<lb/>
            man cannot depart from virtue, or inasmuch as virtue is not <lb/>
            liable to move, nor is the virtuous man inclined to changes, <lb/>
            but each of these things is established on the sure fondation <lb/>
            of right reason.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            And again, the scripture saith in another passage, "But stand thou here with me."† For this is an oracle of God, <lb/>
            which was given to the prophet, and his station was to be one <lb/>
            of unmoved tranquility by God, who always stands immov <lb/>
            ably; for it is indispensable, that all things wich are placed <lb/>
            by the side of him must be kept straight by such an undevi­ <lb/>
            excessive pride, named Jethro, seems to me, that <lb/>
            excessive pride, named Jethro, marvelling at his unvarying <lb/>
            and always equal choice of what was wise, a choice which <lb/>
            always looked at the same things in the same way, was per­ <lb/>
            plexed, and put a question to him in tfis form Why dost<lb/>
            thou sit by thyself?"‡ For any one who considers the con-<lb/>
            tinual war raging among men in the middle of peace and <lb/>
            existing, not merely among nations and contries, and cities, <lb/>
            but also among private houses, or I might rather say, between <lb/>
            every individual man and the inexpressible and heavy storms <lb/>
            which agitate the souls of men, which, by their evident im-s <lb/>
            petuosity, throw into confusion all the affairs of life, may very <lb/>
            naturally wonder, if in such a storm, any one can enjoy tran- <lb/>
            quillity, and can feel a calm in'such a billowy state of the <lb/>
            stormy sea.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            You see that even the high priest, that is to say, reason, who might at all times remain and reside in the holy dwell-<lb/>
            ing of God has not free permission to approach them at all <lb/>
            times, but only once in each year; for whatever is associated<lb/>
            with reason by utterance is not firm, because it is of a twofold <lb/>
            nature. But because safest conduct is to contemlate the living<lb/>
            <lb/>
            God by the soul alone, without utterance of any voice,because<lb/>
            he exists according to the indivisible unit.</p>
          <p>XII. As, therefore, among men in general, that is to say, <lb/>
            among those who propose to themselves many objects in life, <lb/>
            the divine spirit does not remain even though it may abide<lb/>
            among them for a very short time, but it remains among one<lb/>
            species of men alone, namely, among those who, having put off <lb/>
            all the rhings of creation, and the inmost veil and covering<lb/>
            <note type="footnote">* Numbers xiv. 44.</note><note type="footnote">†Deut. v 3l. ‡ Exodus xviii. 14.</note><lb/>
            <note type="footnote"> z 2 </note> <pb n="340"/>
            </p>
          <p>of false opinion, come to God in their unconcealed and naked <lb/>
            . minds. Thus also Moses, having fixed his tent outside of the <lb/>
            tabernacle and outside of all the corporeal army,* that is to <lb/>
            say, having established his mind so that it should not move, <lb/>
            begins to worship God, and having entered into the darkness, <lb/>
            that invisible country, remains there, performing the most <lb/>
            sacred mysteries; and he becomes, not merely an initiated <lb/>
            man, but also an hierophant of mysteries and a teacher of <lb/>
            divine things, which he will explain to those whose ears are <lb/>
            purified; therefore the divine spirit is always standing by <lb/>
            him, conducting him in every right way: but from other men, <lb/>
            as I have said before, it very soon separates itself, and com­ <lb/>
            pletes their life in the number of a hundred and twenty years.</p>
          <p>For God says, "their days shall be an hundred and twenty <lb/>
            years ;"t but Moses, when he had arrived at that number of <lb/>
            years, departed from mortal life to another. How, then, can it he <lb/>
            natural for men who are guilty to live an equal length of time <lb/>
            with the all-wise prophet? for the present, it will be sufficient <lb/>
            to say this, that things which bear the same name are not in <lb/>
            all cases alike, but very often they are distinct in their whole <lb/>
            genus ; and also that which is bad may have equal numbers and <lb/>
            times with what is good, since they are represented as twofold, <lb/>
            but still they have their respective powers, distinct from one <lb/>
            another, and as remote and different as possible.</p>
          <p>And we shall hereafter institute a more exact discussion of <lb/>
            this period of a hundred and twenty years, which we will how­ <lb/>
            ever postpone, till we come to an examination of the whole life <lb/>
            of the prophet, when we have become fit to be initiated in it, but <lb/>
            at present we will discuss what comes next in order.</p>
          <p>XIII. " And there were giants on the earth in those days."t <lb/>
            Perhaps some one may here think, that the lawgiver is speaking <lb/>
            enigmatically and alluding to the fables handed down by the <lb/>
            poets about giants, though he is a man as far removed as pos­ <lb/>
            sible from any invention of fables, and one who thinks fit only <lb/>
            to walk in the paths of truth itself; in consequence of which <lb/>
            principle, he has banished from the constitution, which he has <lb/>
            established, those celebrated and beautiful arts of statuary and <lb/>
            painting, because they, falsely imitating the nature of the truth, <lb/>
            contrive deceits and snares, in order, through the medium of the <lb/>
            eyes, to beguile the souls which are liable to be easily won over. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deut. xxiv. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis vi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="341"/>
            Therefore he utters no fable whatever respecting the giants ; <lb/>
            but he wishes to set this fact before your eyes, that some men <lb/>
            are born of the earth, and some are born of heaven, and some <lb/>
            are born of God: those are born of the earth, who are hunters <lb/>
            after the pleasures of the body, devoting themselves to the en­ <lb/>
            joyment and fruition of them, and being eager to provide them­ <lb/>
            selves with all things that tend to each of them. Those again <lb/>
            are born of heaven who are men of skill and science and devoted <lb/>
            to learning; for the heavenly portion of us is our mind, and the <lb/>
            mind of every one of those persons who are born of heaven <lb/>
            studies the encyclical branches of education and every other art <lb/>
            of every description, sharpening, and exercising, and practising <lb/>
            itself, and rendering itself acute in all those matters which are <lb/>
            the objects of intellect.</p>
          <p>Lastly, those who are born of God are priests and prophets, <lb/>
            who have not thought fit to mix themselves up in the constitu­ <lb/>
            tions of this world, and to become cosmopolites, but who having <lb/>
            raised themselves above all the objects of the mere outward <lb/>
            senses, have departed and fixed their views on that world which <lb/>
            is perceptible only by the intellect, and have settled there, being <lb/>
            inscribed in the state of incorruptible incorporeal ideas.</p>
          <p>XIV. Accordingly, Abraham, as long as he was abiding in <lb/>
            the laud of the Chaldæans, that is to say, in opinion, before he <lb/>
            received his new name, and while lie was still called Abram, <lb/>
            was a man born of heaven, investigating the sublime nature of <lb/>
            things on high, and all that took place in these regions, and <lb/>
            the causes of them, and studying everything of that kind in <lb/>
            the true spirit of philosophy; on which account he received an <lb/>
            appellation corresponding to the pursuits to which he devoted <lb/>
            himself: for the name Abram, being interpreted, signifies <lb/>
            the sublime father, and is a name very fitting for the paternal <lb/>
            mind, which in every direction contemplates sublime and hea­ <lb/>
            venly things : for the mind is the father of our composite being, <lb/>
            reaching as high as the sky and even farther.</p>
          <p>But when he became improved, and was about to have his <lb/>
            name changed, he then became a man born of God, according <lb/>
            to the oracle which was delivered to him, " I am thy God, take <lb/>
            care that thou art approved before me, and be thou blameless."* <lb/>
            But if the Gcd of the world, being the only God, is also by <lb/>
            especial favour the peculiar God of this individual man, then <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xvii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="342"/>
            of necessity the man must also be a man of God ; for the name <lb/>
            Abraham, being interpreted, signifies, " the elect father of <lb/>
            sound," the reason of the good man : for he is chosen out of all, <lb/>
            and purified, and the father of the voice by which we speak; <lb/>
            and being such a character as this, he is assigned to the one <lb/>
            only God, whose minister he becomes, and so makes the path <lb/>
            of his whole life straight, using in real truth the royal road, the <lb/>
            road of the only king who governs all things, turning aside and <lb/>
            deviating neither to the left hand nor to the right.</p>
          <p>XV. But the sons of earth removing their minds from con­ <lb/>
            templation, and becoming deserters so as to fly to the lifeless <lb/>
            and immovable nature of the flesh, " for they two became one <lb/>
            flesh,"* as the lawgiver says, adulterated the excellent coinage, <lb/>
            and abandoned the better rank which had been allotted to them <lb/>
            as their own, and deserted to the worse rank, which was con­ <lb/>
            trary to their original nature, Nimrod being the first to set the <lb/>
            example of this desertion ; for the lawgiver says, " that this man <lb/>
            began to be a giant upon the earth :"t and the name Nimrod, <lb/>
            being interpreted, means, desertion; for it was not enough for <lb/>
            the thoroughly miserable soul to stand on neither side, but <lb/>
            having gone over to its enemies, it took up arms against its <lb/>
            friends, and resisted them, and made open war upon them; in <lb/>
            reference to which fact it is that, Moses calls the seat of Nim­ <lb/>
            rod's kingdom Babylon, and the interpretation of the word <lb/>
            Babylon is "change;" a thing nearly akin to desertion, <lb/>
            the name, too, being akin to the name, and the one action to <lb/>
            the other; for the first step of every deserter is a change and <lb/>
            alteration of mind, and it would be consistent in the truth to <lb/>
            say that, according to the most holy Moses, the bad man, as <lb/>
            being one destitute of a home and of a city, without any settled <lb/>
            habitation, and a fugitive, is naturally a deserter also; but the <lb/>
            good man is the firmest of allies.</p>
          <p>Having said thus much at present, and dwelt sufficiently on <lb/>
            the subject of the giants, we will now proceed to what comes <lb/>
            next in our subject, which is this. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 24. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis x. 29 is the passage supposed to be alluded to; but as <lb/>
            translated in the bible it only says " He was a mighty hunter before <lb/>

          <p>I. " AND after this," says Moses, " it came to pass that the <lb/>
            angels of God went in unto the daughters of men, and they <lb/>
            bore children unto them." * It is worth while, therefore, <lb/>
            to consider what is meant by the expression, "And after this." <lb/>
            It is therefore a reference to something that has been said <lb/>
            before, for the purpose of explaining it more clearly; and a <lb/>
            mention of the divine spirit has already been made, as he has <lb/>
            already stated, that it is very difficult for it to remain through­ <lb/>
            out all ages in the soul, which is divisible into many parts, and <lb/>
            which assumes many forms, and is clothed with a most heavy <lb/>
            burden, namely its bulk of flesh; after this spirit, therefore, <lb/>
            the angels of God go in unto the daughters of men. For as <lb/>
            long as the pure rays of wisdom shine forth in the soul, by <lb/>
            means of which the wise man sees God and his powers, no one <lb/>
            of those who bring false news ever enters into the reason, but <lb/>
            all such are kept at a distance outside of the sacred thresh­ <lb/>
            hold.</p>
          <p>But when the light of the intellect is dimmed and over­ <lb/>
            shadowed, then the companions of darkness having become <lb/>
            victorious, associate themselves with the dissolute and <lb/>
            effeminate passions which the prophet calls the daughters of <lb/>
            men, and they bear children to them and not to God. For the <lb/>
            appropriate progeny of God are the perfect virtues, but that <lb/>
            offspring which is akin to the wicked, is unregulated wicked­ <lb/>
            ness. But learn thou, if thou wilt, 0 my mind, not to bear <lb/>
            children to thyself, after the example of that perfect man <lb/>
            Abraham, who offered up to God " The beloved and only <lb/>
            legitimate offspring of his soul," t the most conspicuous image <lb/>
            of self-taught wisdom, by name Isaac ; and who gave him up <lb/>
            with all cheerfulness to be a necessary and fitting offering to <lb/>
            God. (, Having bound,"‡ as the scripture says, this new <lb/>
            kind of victim, either because he, having once tasted of the <lb/>
            divine inspiration, did not condescend any longer to tread on <lb/>
            any mortal truth, or because he saw that the creature was <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxii. 2, </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="344"/>
            unstable and moveable, while he recognised the unhesitating <lb/>
            firmness existing in the living God, on whom he is said to <lb/>
            have believed.*</p>
          <p>II. His disciple and successor was Hannah. The gift of <lb/>
            the wisdom of God, for the interpretation of the name is her <lb/>
            grace. For when she had become pregnant, having received <lb/>
            the divine seed, and after she had completed the time of her <lb/>
            labour, she brought forth, in the manner appointed by the <lb/>
            arrangement of God, a son, whom she called Samuel ; and the <lb/>
            name Samuel being interpreted, means " appointed by God." <lb/>
            She therefore having received him restores him to the giver; <lb/>
            not looking upon anything as a good belonging to herself which <lb/>
            is not divine grace. For in the first book of Kings,! she speaks <lb/>
            in this manner: " I give him unto thee freely," the expres­ <lb/>
            sion here used being equivalent to, "I give him unto thee whom <lb/>
            thou hast given to me." According to that most sacred scrip­ <lb/>
            ture of Moses, " My gifts and my offerings, and my first fruits, <lb/>
            ye shall observe to offer unto me." ‡ For to what other being <lb/>
            should one bring gifts of gratitude except to God ? and what <lb/>
            offerings can one bring unto him except of those things which <lb/>
            have been given to us by him? For it is not possible for us <lb/>
            to have an abundance of anything else.</p>
          <p>And he has no need of any of those things which he enjoins <lb/>
            men to offer unto him, but he bids us bring unto him the <lb/>
            things which are his own, through the excess of his beneficence <lb/>
            to our race. For we, studying to conduct ourselves with grati­ <lb/>
            tude to him, and to show him all honours, should purify our­ <lb/>
            selves from sin, washing off all things that can stain our life in <lb/>
            words, or appearance, or actions. For it is foolishness to <lb/>
            imagine, that it is unlawful to enter into temples, unless a man <lb/>
            has first washed his body and made that look bright, but that <lb/>
            one may attempt to sacrifice and to pray with a mind still pol­ <lb/>
            luted and disordered. And yet temples are made of stones <lb/>
            and timber, mere lifeless materials, and it is not possible for <lb/>
            the body, if it is devoid of life by its own nature, to touch things <lb/>
            devoid of life, without using ablutions and purifying ceremonies <lb/>
            of holiness ; and shall any one endure to approach God without <lb/>
            being purified as to his soul, shall any one while impure come <lb/>
            near to the purest of all beings, and this too without having <lb/>
            any intention of repenting? Let him, indeed who, in addition <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xv. 6. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Samuel i. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xxviii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="345"/>
            to having committed no new crimes, has also endeavoured to <lb/>
            wash off his old misdeeds, come cheerfully before him ; but <lb/>
            let the man who is without any such preparation, and who is <lb/>
            impure, keep aloof. For he will never escape the notice of <lb/>
            him who can look into the recesses of the heart, and who <lb/>
            walketh in its most secret places.</p>
          <p>III. Now the most evident sign of a soul devoted to God is <lb/>
            that song in which that expression occurs, " She that was <lb/>
            barren has borne seven children, and she that had many <lb/>
            children has become weak." * And yet she who is speaking <lb/>
            is in reality only the mother of one son, namely, of Samuel. <lb/>
            How then does she say that she has borne seven children, <lb/>
            unless indeed any one thinks that the unit is in its strictest <lb/>
            nature identical with the number seven, not only in number, <lb/>
            but also in the harmony of the universe, and in the reasonings <lb/>
            of the soul which is devoted to virtue ? For he who was <lb/>
            devoted to the one God, that is Samuel, and who had no con­ <lb/>
            nection whatever with any other being, is adorned according <lb/>
            to that essence which is single and the real unit; and this is <lb/>
            the constitution of the number seven, that is to say, of the <lb/>
            soul that rests in God, and which no longer concerns itself <lb/>
            about any mortal employment, when it has quitted the number <lb/>
            six which it allotted to those who were not able to attain to the <lb/>
            first rank, but who of necessity contented themselves with <lb/>
            arriving at the second.</p>
          <p>It is therefore not incredible that the barren woman, not <lb/>
            being one who is incapable of becoming fruitful, but one who <lb/>
            is still vigorous and fresh, striving for the chief reward in the <lb/>
            arena of fortitude, patience, and perseverance, may bring forth <lb/>
            a seven, equal in honour to the unit, of which numbers, nature <lb/>
            is very productive and prolific. And she says, that " she that <lb/>
            had many children has become weak," speaking accurately and <lb/>
            very plainly. For when the soul, although only one, brings <lb/>
            forth many children when separated from the one, it then <lb/>
            naturally becomes infinite in number , and then being weighed <lb/>
            down and overwhelmed by the multitude of children who depend <lb/>
            upon it, (and the greatest part of them are premature and <lb/>
            abortive), it becomes weak. For it brings forth the desire of <lb/>
            forms and colours, as gratified by the eyes, and the pleasures <lb/>
            arising from sound, as gratified by the ears. It is pregnant <note type="footnote"> * 1 Samuel ii. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="346"/>
            also of the pleasures of the belly and of the parts beneath the <lb/>
            belly, so that, as many children are attached to it, it becomes <lb/>
            exhausted by bearing this heavy burden, and drops its hands <lb/>
            from weakness, and faints away. And in this way it comes to <lb/>
            pass that all those things are subdued which bring forth perish­ <lb/>
            able children to themselves, who are likewise perishable.</p>
          <p>IV. But some persons, through their self-love, have incurred <lb/>
            not only defeat but even death also. At all events Onan, <lb/>
            " knowing that the seed should not be his,"* did not desist <lb/>
            from injuring the rational principle, which is the best thing in <lb/>
            kind of all existing things, until he himself met with utter <lb/>
            destruction. And this, too, very properly and deservedly; for <lb/>
            if some men do all things for the sake of themselves alone, <lb/>
            not with a view to the honour of their parents, or the proper <lb/>
            regulation of their children, or the salvation of their country, <lb/>
            or the guardianship of the laws, or the preservation of good <lb/>
            morals, or with a view to the due performance of any public or <lb/>
            private duty, or of a proper celebration of sacred rites, or the <lb/>
            pious worship due to the gods, they will be deservedly misera­ <lb/>
            ble. For the sake of one of the objects which I have men­ <lb/>
            tioned, it is glorious even to quit life itself. But these men <lb/>
            say that, unless they are likely to gain some pleasure by the <lb/>
            pursuit of them, they would disregard the whole lot of them­ <lb/>
            glorious objects as they are.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the incorruptible God banishes the wicked expo­ <lb/>
            sition of unnatural opinion, which is named Onan. And alto­ <lb/>
            gether these persons are to be detested who beget children for <lb/>
            themselves, that is to say, who, pursuing their own private <lb/>
            advantage alone, disregard all other objects, as if they had <lb/>
            been born for themselves alone, and not for ten thousand other <lb/>
            persons also, for their fathers, and their mothers, and their <lb/>
            wives, and their children, and their country, and for all man­ <lb/>
            kind. And if we must go further and add any thing to this <lb/>
            enumeration, we may say for heaven, and earth, and the whole <lb/>
            universe, and for the sciences, and for the virtues, and for the <lb/>
            Father and Ruler of all; to every one of which a man ought <lb/>
            to pay what is due to the best of his power, not looking upon <lb/>
            all the world as an addition to himself, but on himself as an <lb/>
            addition to the rest of the world. <note type="footnote"> It Genesis xxxviii. 9. </note></p><pb n="347"/>
            
          <p>V. However, we have said enough on this head; let us now <lb/>
            connect what follows with it :­</p>
          <p>" The Lord God, therefore," says Moses, " seeing that the <lb/>
            wickedness of man was multiplied upon the earth, and that <lb/>
            every one of them was carefully studying wickedness in his <lb/>
            heart all his days; God considered in his mind that he had <lb/>
            made man upon the earth, and he thought upon it; and God <lb/>
            said, I will destroy man whom I have made from off the face <lb/>
            of the earth."✽ Perhaps some very wicked persons will sus­ <lb/>
            pect that the lawgiver is here speaking enigmatically, when he <lb/>
            says that the Creator repented of having created man, when <lb/>
            he beheld their wickedness; on which account he determined <lb/>
            to destroy the whole race. But let those who adopt such <lb/>
            opinions as these know, that they are making light of and <lb/>
            extenuating the offences of these men of old time, by reason of <lb/>
            their own excessive impiety ; for what can be a greater act of <lb/>
            wickedness than to think that the unchangeable God can be <lb/>
            changed? And this, too, while some persons think that even <lb/>
            those who are really men do never hesitate in their opinions, <lb/>
            for that those, who have studied philosophy in a sincere and <lb/>
            pure spirit, have derived as the greatest good arising from their <lb/>
            knowledge, the absence of any inclination to change with the <lb/>
            changes of affairs, and the disposition, with all immovable <lb/>
            firmness and sure stability, to labour at every thing that it <lb/>
            becomes them to pursue.</p>
          <p>VI. And it seems good to the lawgiver that the perfect <lb/>
            man should should desire tranquillity; for it was said to the <lb/>
            wise man in the character of God, " But stand thou here with <lb/>
            me,"t this expression showing the unchangeable and unaltera­ <lb/>
            ble nature of the mind which is firmly established in <lb/>
            the right way; for it is really marvellous when any one <lb/>
            touches the soul, like a lyre tuned in musical principles, not <lb/>
            with sharp and flat sounds, but with an accurate knowledge of <lb/>
            contrary tones, and employing only the best, not sounding <lb/>
            any too loudly, nor on the other hand letting any be too weak, <lb/>
            so as to impair the harmony of the virtues and of those things <lb/>
            which are good by nature, and when he, preserving it in an <lb/>
            equal condition plays and sings melodiously; for this instru­ <lb/>
            ment nature has made to be the most perfect of all, and to be <lb/>
            the model of all instruments made by the hand. And if this <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy v. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="348"/>
            be properly tuned, it will utter the most exquisite of all sym­ <lb/>
            phonies, which consists not in the combination and tones of a <lb/>
            melodious voice, but in a harmonious agreement of all the <lb/>
            actions in life; therefore, as the soul of man can allay the <lb/>
            excessive storm and swell of the sea, which the violent and <lb/>
            irresistible gale of wickedess has suddenly raised, by the gentle <lb/>
            breezes of knowledge and wisdom, and having mitigated its <lb/>
            swelling and boisterous fury, enjoys tranquillity resting in an <lb/>
            unruffled calm. Do you doubt whether the imperishable, <lb/>
            and everlasting, and blessed God, the Being endowed with <lb/>
            all the virtues, and with all perfection, and with all <lb/>
            happiness is unchangeable in his counsels, and whether he <lb/>
            abides by the designs which he originally formed, without <lb/>
            changing any of them. Facility of change is indeed an <lb/>
            attribute of man, which is of necessity incidental to their <lb/>
            nature by reason of its external want of firmness ; as in this <lb/>
            way, for instance :-often when we have chosen friends, and <lb/>
            have lived some short time with them, without having any <lb/>
            thing to accuse them of, we then turn away from them, so as to <lb/>
            place ourselves in the rank of enemies, or at least of strangers <lb/>
            to them; now this conduct shows the facility and levity of <lb/>
            ourselves, who are unable steadily to adhere to the professions <lb/>
            which we originally made; but God is not so easily sated or <lb/>
            wearied.</p>
          <p>Again there are times when we determine to abide by the <lb/>
            same judgment that we have formed; but those who join us <lb/>
            do not equally abide by theirs, so that our opinions of neces­ <lb/>
            sity change as well as theirs ; for it is impossible for us, who <lb/>
            are but men, to foresee all the contingencies of future events, <lb/>
            or to anticipate the opinions of others ; but to God, as dwelling <lb/>
            in pure light, all things are visible; for he penetrating into <lb/>
            the very recesses of the soul, is able to see, with the most <lb/>
            perfect certainty, what is invisible to others, and being possess­ <lb/>
            ed of prescience and of providence, his own peculiar attributes, <lb/>
            he allows nothing to abuse its liberty, and to stray out of the <lb/>
            reach of his comprehension, since with him, there is no un­ <lb/>
            certanty even in the future, for there is nothing uncertain nor <lb/>
            even future to God.</p>
          <p>It is plain therefore that the creator of all created things, <lb/>
            and the maker of all the things that have ever been made, <lb/>
            and the governor of all the things which are subject to <lb/>
             <pb n="349"/>
            government, must of necessity be a being of universal know­ <lb/>
            ledge ; and be is in truth the father, and creator, and governor <lb/>
            of all things in heaven and in the whole world ; and indeed <lb/>
            future events are overshadowed by the distance of future <lb/>
            time, which is sometimes a short and sometimes a long interval. <lb/>
            But God is the creator of time also; for he is the father of <lb/>
            its father, and the father of time is the world, which made <lb/>
            its own mother the creation of time, so that time stands <lb/>
            towards God in the relation of a grandson : for this world is <lb/>
            a younger son of God, inasmuch as it is perceptible by the <lb/>
            outward sense ; for the only son he speaks of as older than <lb/>
            the world, is idea,* and this is not perceptible by the intellect; <lb/>
            but having thought the other worthy of the rights of pri­ <lb/>
            mogeniture, he has decided that it shall remain with him; <lb/>
            therefore, this younger son, perceptible, by the external senses <lb/>
            being set in motion, has caused the nature of time to shine <lb/>
            forth, and to become conspicuous, so that there is nothing <lb/>
            future to God, who has the very boundaries of time subject to <lb/>
            him ; for their life is not time, but the beautiful model of <lb/>
            time, eternity ; and in eternity nothing is past and nothing is <lb/>
            future, but everything is present only.</p>
          <p>VII. Having therefore now sufficiently discussed the ques­ <lb/>
            tion of the living God never knowing repentance, it comes <lb/>
            next in order for us to explain what is the meaning of the <lb/>
            expression, " God considered that he had made man upon the <lb/>
            earth, and he thought within himself." Then the creator of the <lb/>
            world, having attached to himself the two most lasting powers <lb/>
            of cogitation and deliberation-the one being a conception <lb/>
            conceived within his own breast, and the other the discussion <lb/>
            of such conception-and since he continually employs them for <lb/>
            the contemplation of his own works, those things which do <lb/>
            not leave their appointed station he praises for their obedience, <lb/>
            but those which change their place he pursues with the <lb/>
            punishment appointed for deserters ; for some bodies he has <lb/>
            endowed with habit, others with nature, others with soul, and <lb/>
            some with rational soul; for instance, he has bound stones and <lb/>
            beams, which are torn from their kindred materials, with the <lb/>
            most powerful bond of habit; and this habit is the inclination <lb/>
            of the spirit to return to itself; for it begins at the middle and <note type="footnote"> * T have followed Mangey, who proposes to read <foreign xml:lang="grc">ίδέαν</foreign> here but the <lb/>
            reading in the text is <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὐὄένα</foreign>. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="350"/>
            proceeds onwards towards the extremities, and then when it <lb/>
            has touched the extreme boundary, it turns back again, until <lb/>
            it has again arrived at the same place from which it originally <lb/>
            started. This is the continued unalterable course, up and <lb/>
            down, of habit, which runners, imitating in their triennial <lb/>
            festivals, in those great common spectacles of all men, display <lb/>
            as a brilliant achievement, and a worthy subject of rivalry <lb/>
            and contention.</p>
          <p>VIII. And he has given to plants a nature which he has <lb/>
            combined of as many powers as possible, that is of the <lb/>
            nutritive, and the changeable, and the forming power; for <lb/>
            they are nourished when they have need of nourishment; and <lb/>
            a proof of this is that those plants which are not irrigated <lb/>
            waste away and are dried up, as on the other hand those which <lb/>
            have water supplied to them do visibly grow, for those which <lb/>
            for a time were mere creepers on the ground, by reason of <lb/>
            their shortness, suddenly spring up and become very long <lb/>
            branches. And why need I speak of the changes which they <lb/>
            undergo ? for at the time of the winter solstice then: leaves <lb/>
            wither and fall to the ground; and the eyes, as they are called <lb/>
            by the agricultural labourers, which appear on the young shoots, <lb/>
            close up like the eyes of animals, and all the mouths which <lb/>
            are calculated to send forth young buds, are bound up; their <lb/>
            internal nature being at that time confined and quiet, in order <lb/>
            that, when it has taken breath, like a wrestler who has gone <lb/>
            through a little preliminary exercise, and having again collected <lb/>
            its appropriate strength, it may return again to its customary <lb/>
            operations.</p>
          <p>And this happens at' the seasons of both spring and sum­ <lb/>
            mer, for then their nature, waking as it were out of a deep <lb/>
            sleep, opens its eyes, and expands and widens its previously <lb/>
            closed mouth; and then it brings forth all those things of <lb/>
            which it was pregnant, leaves, and young shoots, and tendrils, <lb/>
            and feelers, and fruit on all its branches ; and then when <lb/>
            these things have come to perfection it affords nourishment <lb/>
            and food to them, as a mother does to her child by some <lb/>
            invisible passages which are similar in principle to the breasts <lb/>
            in women, and it never ceases to nourish them until the fruit <lb/>
            be come to complete ripeness; and that which is thoroughly <lb/>
            ripe is then perfected, when, even if no one gathers it, it of <lb/>
            its own accord hastens to separate itself from its kindred <lb/>
             <pb n="351"/>
            branch, inasmuch as it no longer stands in need of nourish­ <lb/>
            ment from its parent, being able, if it should meet with a <lb/>
            fitting soil, itself to sow and beget offspring resembling its <lb/>
            own parents.</p>
          <p>IX. And the Creator has made the soul to differ from nature <lb/>
            in these things-in the outward sense, and imagination, and <lb/>
            impetuosity ; for plants are destitute of impetuosity and devoid <lb/>
            of imagination, and without any participation in the outward <lb/>
            sense. But every animal partakes of all these qualities above- <lb/>
            mentioned, all together. Now the outward sense, as indeed <lb/>
            its name shows, in some degree is a kind of insertion, placing <lb/>
            the things that are made apparent to it in the mind; for in the <lb/>
            mind, since that is the greatest store-house and receptacle for <lb/>
            all things, is everything placed and treasured up which comes <lb/>
            under the operation of the sense of seeing or hearing, or the <lb/>
            other organs of the outward senses. And imagination is an <lb/>
            impression of figures in the soul; for the things which each of <lb/>
            the outward senses has brought in, like a ring or a seal, on <lb/>
            them it imprints its own character. And the mind, being like <lb/>
            wax, having received the impression, keeps it carefully in itself <lb/>
            until forgetfulness, the enemy of memory, has smoothed off the <lb/>
            edges of the impression, or else has rendered it dim, or perhaps <lb/>
            has completely effaced it.</p>
          <p>And that which has been visible and has been impressed <lb/>
            upon the soul at times affects the soul in a way consistent with <lb/>
            itself, and at other times in a different way; and this passion <lb/>
            to which it is subject is called appetite, which philosophers who <lb/>
            define such things say is the first motion of the soul. In such <lb/>
            important points are animals superior to plants.</p>
          <p>Let us now see in what man is superior to the rest of the <lb/>
            animal creation.</p>
          <p>X. Man, then, has received this one extraordinary gift, in­ <lb/>
            tellect, which is accustomed to comprehend the nature of all <lb/>
            bodies and of all things at the same time ; for, as in the body, <lb/>
            the sight is the most important faculty, and since in the universe <lb/>
            the nature of light is the most pre-eminent thing, in the same <lb/>
            manner that part of us which is entitled to the highest rank is <lb/>
            the mind. For the mind is the sight of the soul, shining <lb/>
            transcendently with its own rays, by which the great and dense <lb/>
            darkness which ignorance of things sheds around is dissipated. <lb/>
            This species of soul is not composed of the same elements as <lb/>
             <pb n="352"/>
            those of which the other kinds were made, but it has received <lb/>
            a purer and more excellent essence of which the divine natures <lb/>
            were formed; on which account the intellect naturally appears <lb/>
            to be the only thing in us which is imperishable, for that is <lb/>
            the only quality in us which the Father, who created us, thought <lb/>
            deserving of freedom; and, unloosing the bonds of necessity, <lb/>
            he let it go unrestrained, bestowing on it that most admirable <lb/>
            gift and most connected with himself, the power, namely, of <lb/>
            spontaneous will, as far as he was able to receive it; for the <lb/>
            irrational animals, in whose soul there is not that especial gift <lb/>
            tending to freedom, namely, mind, are put under the yoke and <lb/>
            have bridles put in their mouths, and so are given unto men to <lb/>
            be their slaves, as servants are given to their masters. But <lb/>
            man, who has had bestowed on him a voluntary and self-impel­ <lb/>
            ling intellect, and who for the most part puts forth his energies <lb/>
            in accordance with deliberate purpose, very properly receives <lb/>
            blame for the offences which he designedly commits, and praise <lb/>
            for the good actions which he intentionally performs. For, in <lb/>
            the case of other plants and other animals, we cannot call either <lb/>
            the good that is caused by them deserving of praise, nor the <lb/>
            evil that they do deserving of blame ; for all their motions in <lb/>
            either direction, and all their changes, have no design about <lb/>
            them, but are involuntary. But the soul of man, being the <lb/>
            only one which has received from God the power of voluntary <lb/>
            motion, and which in this respect has been made-to resemble <lb/>
            God, and being as far as possible emancipated from the autho­ <lb/>
            rity of that grievous and severe mistress, necessity, may rightly <lb/>
            be visited with reproach if she does not pay due honour to the <lb/>
            being who has emancipated her. And therefore, in such a case, <lb/>
            she will most deservedly suffer the implacable punishment <lb/>
            denounced against slavish and ungrateful minds.</p>
          <p>So that God " considered" and thought within himself, not <lb/>
            now for the first time, but long ago, and with great steadiness <lb/>
            and resolution, " that he had made man;" that is to say, he <lb/>
            considered within himself what kind of being he had made <lb/>
            him. For he had made him free from all bondage or restraint, <lb/>
            able to exert his energies in accordance with his own will and <lb/>
            deliberate purpose, on this account: that so knowing what <lb/>
            things were good and what, on the contrary, were evil, and <lb/>
            having arrived at a proper comprehension of what is honour­ <lb/>
            able and what is disgraceful, and apprehending what things <lb/>
             <pb n="353"/>
            are just and what unjust, and, in short, what things flow from <lb/>
            virtue and what from wickedness, he might exercise a choice <lb/>
            of the better objects and an avoidance of their opposites ; and <lb/>
            this is the meaning of the oracle recorded in Deuteronomy, <lb/>
            " Behold, I have put before thy face life and death; good and <lb/>
            evil. Do thou choose life."✽ Therefore he teaches us by this <lb/>
            sentence both that men have a knowledge of good and of the <lb/>
            contrary, evil, and that it is their duty to choose the better in <lb/>
            preference to the worse, preserving reason within themselves <lb/>
            as an incorruptible judge, to be guided by the arguments which <lb/>
            sound sense suggests, and to reject those which are brought <lb/>
            forward by the contrary power.</p>
          <p>XI. Having now therefore explained these matters suffi­ <lb/>
            ciently, let us pass on to what comes next.</p>
          <p>And this is what follows : "I will destroy," says God, " the <lb/>
            man whom I have made from off the face of the earth, from <lb/>
            man to beast, from creeping things to the fowls of the air, be­ <lb/>
            cause I have considered and repent that I have made them." † <lb/>
            Now, some persons, when they hear the expressions which I <lb/>
            have just cited, imagine that the living God is here giving away <lb/>
            to anger and passion ; but God is utterly inaccessible to any <lb/>
            passion whatever. For it is the peculiar property of human <lb/>
            weakness to be disquieted by any such feelings, but God has <lb/>
            neither the irrational passions of the soul, nor are the parts <lb/>
            and limits of the body in the least belonging to him. But, <lb/>
            nevertheless, such things are spoken of with reference to God <lb/>
            by the great lawgiver in an introductory sort of way, for the <lb/>
            sake of admonishing those persons who could not be corrected <lb/>
            otherwise. For of all the laws which are couched in the form <lb/>
            of injunction or prohibition, and such alone are properly speak­ <lb/>
            ing laws; there are two principal positions laid down with <lb/>
            respect to the great cause of all things: one, that God is <lb/>
            not as a man; the other, that God is as a man. ‡ But the <lb/>
            first of these assertions is confirmed by the most certain truth, <lb/>
            while the latter is introduced for the instruction of the many. <lb/>
            In reference to which, it is said concerning them, " as a man <lb/>
            would instruct his son." § And this is said for the sake of <lb/>
            instruction and admonition, and not because he is really such <lb/>
            by nature. For of men some are attached to the service of the <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxx. 15. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Numbers xxiii. 19. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Genesis vi. 7. </note><note type="footnote"> § Deuteronomy i. 31. </note> <note type="footnote"> A A </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="354"/>
            soul, and others to that of the body; now the companions of <lb/>
            the soul, being able to associate with incorporeal natures, ap­ <lb/>
            preciable only by the intellect, do not compare the living God to <lb/>
            any species of created beings ; but, dissociating it with any idea <lb/>
            of distinctive qualities (for this is what most especially con­ <lb/>
            tributes to his happiness and to his consummate felicity, to <lb/>
            comprehend his naked existence without any connection with <lb/>
            figure or character), they, I say, are content with the bare con­ <lb/>
            ception of his existence, and do not attempt to invest him with <lb/>
            any form.</p>
          <p>But those who enter into agreements and alliances with the <lb/>
            body, being unable to throw off the robes of the flesh, and to <lb/>
            behold that nature, which alone of all natures has no need of <lb/>
            anything, but is sufficient for itself, and simple, and unalloyed, <lb/>
            and incapable of being compared with anything else, from the <lb/>
            same notions of the cause of all things that they do of them­ <lb/>
            selves ; not considering that in the case of a being who exists <lb/>
            through a concurrence of many faculties, he has need of many <lb/>
            parts in order to supply the necessities of each of those facul­ <lb/>
            ties.</p>
          <p>XII. But God, inasmuch as he is uncreated, and the Being <lb/>
            who has brought all other things to creation, stood in need of <lb/>
            none of those things which are usually added to creatures. <lb/>
            For what are we to say ? Shall we say, if he is possessed of <lb/>
            the different organic parts, that he has feet for the sake of <lb/>
            walking ? But where is he to walk who fills all places at once <lb/>
            with his presence ? And to whom is he to go, when there is <lb/>
            no one of equal honour with himself? And why is he to walk? <lb/>
            It cannot be out of any regard for his health as we do. Again, <lb/>
            are we to say that he has hands for the purpose of giving and <lb/>
            taking? he never receives anything from any one. For in <lb/>
            addition to the fact of his wanting nothing he actually has <lb/>
            everything; and when he gives, he employs reason as the <lb/>
            minister of his gifts, by whose agency also he created the <lb/>
            world.</p>
          <p>Once more, he had no need of eyes, the organs without <lb/>
            which there can be no comprehension of the light perceptible <lb/>
            by the outward senses; but the light perceptible by the out­ <lb/>
            ward senses is a created light; and even before the creation <lb/>
            God saw, using himself as light. And why need we mention <lb/>
            the organs of luxury ? For if he has these organs, then he is <lb/>
             <pb n="355"/>
            fed, and when he has satisfied himself he leaves off eating, and <lb/>
            after he has left eating he wants food again; and I need not <lb/>
            enumerate other particulars which are the necessary conse­ <lb/>
            quences of this; for these are the fabulous inventions of im­ <lb/>
            pious men, who represent God, in word indeed only as endued <lb/>
            with human form, but in fact as influenced by human pas­ <lb/>
            sions.</p>
          <p>XIII. Why, then, does Moses speak of the Uncreate as <lb/>
            having feet and hands, and as coming in and as going out ? <lb/>
            And why does he speak of him as clothed in armour for the pur­ <lb/>
            pose of repelling his enemies ? For he does speak of him as <lb/>
            girding himself with a sword, and as using arrows, and winds, <lb/>
            and destructive fire. And the poets say that the whirlwind and <lb/>
            the thunderbolt, mentioning them under other names, are the <lb/>
            weapons of the Cause of all things. Moreover, speaking of <lb/>
            him as they would of men, they add jealousy, anger, passion, <lb/>
            and other feelings like these. But to those who ask questions <lb/>
            on these subjects, one may answer, "My good men ! A man <lb/>
            who would establish the most excellent system of laws, ought <lb/>
            to keep one end constantly in view, namely, to do good to all <lb/>
            who come within his reach." Those, therefore, who have <lb/>
            received a fortunate disposition, and an education in all re­ <lb/>
            spects blameless, finding the path of life which proceeds in this <lb/>
            direction plain and straight, take truth with them as the com­ <lb/>
            panion of their journey; by which they are initiated in the <lb/>
            true mysteries relating to the living God, and therefore they <lb/>
            never attribute any of the properties of created beings to him.</p>
          <p>Now to these disciples, that principal assertion in the sacred <lb/>
            oracles is especially well adapted, that " God is not as man," <lb/>
            but neither is he as heaven, nor as the world; for these <lb/>
            species are endued with distinctive qualities, and they come <lb/>
            under the perception of the outward senses. But he is not <lb/>
            even comprehensible by the intellect, except merely as to <lb/>
            his essence; for his existence, indeed, is a fact which we do <lb/>
            comprehend concerning him, but beyond the fact of his exist­ <lb/>
            ence, we can understand nothing.</p>
          <p>XIV. But those who have received a'duller and more <lb/>
            sluggish nature, and who have been wrongly brought up as <lb/>
            children, and who are unable to see acutely, stand in need of <lb/>
            physicians for law-givers, who may be able to devise an appro­ <lb/>
            priate remedy for the existing complaint, since a severe master <note type="footnote">A A 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="356"/>
            is a beneficial thing for untractable and foolish servants ; for <lb/>
            they, fearing his inflictions and his threats, are chastened by <lb/>
            fear, in spite of themselves. Let, therefore, all such men <lb/>
            learn false terrors, by! which they may be benefited if they <lb/>
            cannot be led into the right way by truth. For in the case of <lb/>
            men who are afflicted with dangerous illnesses, the most legiti­ <lb/>
            mate physicians do not venture to tell them the truth, <lb/>
            knowing that by such conduct they will be rendered more <lb/>
            desponding, and so that the disease will not be cured; but <lb/>
            that by contrary language and comfort, they will bear the dis­ <lb/>
            ease which presses upon them more easily, and the illness will <lb/>
            be more likely to be allayed. For what man in his senses <lb/>
            would say to a patient under his care, " My good man, you <lb/>
            shall have the knife applied to you, and cautery, and your <lb/>
            limbs shall be amputated," even if such things were absolutely <lb/>
            necessary to be endured ? No man on earth would say so. <lb/>
            For if he did, his patient would sink in his heart before the <lb/>
            operations could be performed, and so receiving another dis­ <lb/>
            ease in his soul, more grievous than that already existing in <lb/>
            his body, he would resolutely renounce the cure; but if, on <lb/>
            the other hand, through the deceit of the physician he is led <lb/>
            to form a contrary expectation, he will submit to everything <lb/>
            with a patient spirit, even though the means of his salvation <lb/>
            may may be most painful.</p>
          <p>Therefore the lawgiver, being a most admirable physician <lb/>
            of the passions and diseases of the soul, has proposed to him­ <lb/>
            self one task and one end, namely, to eradicate the diseases <lb/>
            of the mind by the roots, so that there may not be a single one <lb/>
            left behind to put forth any shoot of incurable distemper. In <lb/>
            this way, then, he hoped to be. able to eradicate it, if he were <lb/>
            to represent the Cause of all things as indulging in threats and <lb/>
            indignation, and implacable anger, and, moreover, as employ­ <lb/>
            ing defensive arms to ward off attacks, and to chastise the <lb/>
            wicked; for the fool alone is corrected by such means : and <lb/>
            therefore it is that it appears to me that with these two prin­ <lb/>
            cipal assertions above mentioned, namely, that God is as a <lb/>
            man and that God is not as a man, are connected two other <lb/>
            principles consequent upon and connected with them, namely, <lb/>
            that of fear and that of love; for I see that all the exhort­ <lb/>
            ations of the laws to piety, are referred either to the love or <lb/>
            to the fear of the living God. To those, therefore, who do not <lb/>
             <pb n="357"/>
            attribute either the parts or the passions of men to the living <lb/>
            God, but who, as becomes the majesty of God, honour him in <lb/>
            himself, and by himself alone, to love him is most natural ; <lb/>
            but to the others, it is most appropriate to fear him.</p>
          <p>XV. Such, then, are the things which it was proper to pre­ <lb/>
            mise before we entered upon the following investigation :—</p>
          <p>But we must now go back again to the original considera­ <lb/>
            tion, according to which we were in doubt what the meaning <lb/>
            is which is concealed under the expression, " I was indignant <lb/>
            that I had made them." Perhaps Moses here means to show, <lb/>
            that bad men are made so by the anger of God, but good men <lb/>
            by his grace; for immediately afterwards he proceeds to add, <lb/>
            but " Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." But anger, <lb/>
            which is a passion peculiar to man, is here spoken of with <lb/>
            especial felicity, but still more metaphorically than the real <lb/>
            truth, in order to the explanation of a matter which is ex­ <lb/>
            tremely necessary, namely, to show that everything that we <lb/>
            do through anger, or fear, or pain, or grief, or any other <lb/>
            passion, is confessedly faulty and open to reproach; but all <lb/>
            that we do in accordance with right reason and knowledge is <lb/>
            praiseworthy.</p>
          <p>You see now what great caution he uses in speaking here, <lb/>
            when he says, " I was indignant that I had made them," not <lb/>
            reversing the order of the words so as to say, " Because I had <lb/>
            made them I was indignant;" for the latter expression would <lb/>
            have become a person who repented of what he had done, an <lb/>
            idea which is inconsistent with the nature of God, which fore­ <lb/>
            sees everything. But the other doctrine is a general one, <lb/>
            being the expression of a man who means to explain by it <lb/>
            that anger is the fountain of all sins, and reason the source of <lb/>
            all good actions. But God, remembering his own perfect good­ <lb/>
            ness in every particular, even if the whole or the greater part <lb/>
            of mankind fall off from him by reason of the abundance and <lb/>
            extravagance of their sins, stretching forth his right hand, his <lb/>
            hand of salvation, supports man and raises him up, not per <lb/>
            mitting the whole race to be utterly destroyed and to perish <lb/>
            everlastingly.</p>
          <p>XVI. On which account God now says, that Noah found <lb/>
            grace in his sight, when all the rest of mankind appearing <lb/>
            ungrateful were about to receive punishment, in order that he <lb/>
            might mingle saving mercy with judgment against sinners. <lb/>
             <pb n="358"/>
            As the psalmist has said somewhere, " My song shall be of <lb/>
            mercy and judgment."* For if God were to choose to judge <lb/>
            the race of mankind without mercy, he would pass on them a <lb/>
            sentence of condemnation; since there has never been a <lb/>
            single man who, by his own unassisted power, has run the <lb/>
            whole course of his life, from the beginning to the end, with­ <lb/>
            out stumbling; but since some men have fallen into voluntary. <lb/>
            and some into involuntary sins, that therefore the human race <lb/>
            might still subsist, even though many of the subordinate mem­ <lb/>
            bers of it go to destruction. God mingles mercy with his <lb/>
            justice, which he exercises towards the good actions of even <lb/>
            the unworthy; and he not only pities them while judging, but <lb/>
            judges them while pitying them, for mercy is older than jus­ <lb/>
            tice in his sight, inasmuch as he knew the man who deserved <lb/>
            punishment, not after he had passed sentence on him, but also <lb/>
            before sentence.</p>
          <p>XVII. On which account he says in another passage, " The <lb/>
            cup is in the hand of the Lord; full of the mixture of un­ <lb/>
            mixed wine ;"t and yet that which is mixed is not unmixed ; <lb/>
            but these words are spoken in a sense in the strictest accord­ <lb/>
            ance with natural philosophy, and in one perfectly consistent <lb/>
            with what has been said before; for God exerts his power in <lb/>
            an untempered degree towards himself, but in a mixed cha­ <lb/>
            racter towards his creatures; for it is impossible for a mortal <lb/>
            nature to endure his power unmitigated. Do you think that <lb/>
            you would be unable to look at the unmodified light of the <lb/>
            sun ? If you were to try to do so, your sight would be extin­ <lb/>
            guished by the brilliancy of his rays, and be wholly blinded by <lb/>
            a close approach to that luminary, before it could perceive <lb/>
            anything, and yet the sun is only one of the works of God, <lb/>
            a portion of the heaven, a fragment of compressed æther, <lb/>
            but you are nevertheless able to gaze upon those uncreated <lb/>
            powers which exist around him, and emit the most dazzling <lb/>
            light, without any veil or modification.</p>
          <p>As, therefore, the sun extends his rays from heaven to the <lb/>
            boundaries of the earth, tempering and dissolving the exceed­ <lb/>
            ing violence of the heat that is in them by cool air, for he <lb/>
            mixes his rays with that, in order that that portion of them <lb/>
            which gives light being separated from that portion which <lb/>
            gives heat, he may remit somewhat of his power of burning, <note type="footnote"> * Psalm c. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Psalm lxxv. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="359"/>
            but retain the power by which he gives light, and so be re­ <lb/>
            ceived with welcome, when meeting that kindred and friendly <lb/>
            light which is situated in the eyes of man ; for the meeting of <lb/>
            these two lights in the same place, coming from an opposite <lb/>
            direction, and the reception of the one by the other, is what <lb/>
            causes that comprehension which we arrive at by our faculty <lb/>
            of sight: but what mortal could possibly receive in this man­ <lb/>
            ner the knowledge, and wisdom, and prudence, and justice, <lb/>
            and all the other virtues of God, in an unalloyed state ? The <lb/>
            whole heaven, the whole world, could not do so.</p>
          <p>Therefore the Creator, knowing the way in which he exceeded <lb/>
            in all things that were most excellent, and the inherent natural <lb/>
            weakness of created beings, even though they boast loudly, does <lb/>
            not think either to benefit them or to chastise them to the <lb/>
            extremity of his power, but only as far as he sees that those <lb/>
            who are to be the objects of his benefits or of his chastisements <lb/>
            have power to receive either. If, then, we are able to drink of <lb/>
            and to enjoy a gentle and moderate mixture of his powers, we <lb/>
            might receive sufficient happiness therefrom, than which the <lb/>
            race of man ought not to seek to receive any more complete <lb/>
            enjoyment.</p>
          <p>We have now explained what the mixed and unmixed powers <lb/>
            and what those really supreme faculties are which exist in the <lb/>
            living God alone.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And similar to what has been previously said, is that <lb/>
            passage which occurs in another place, " God spake once, and <lb/>
            twice I have also heard the same."* The expression " once " <lb/>
            resembles the unmixed power, for the unmixed power is the <lb/>
            unit, and the unit is the unmixed power; but the " twice " <lb/>
            resembles the mixed power, for neither one' nor the other is a <lb/>
            simple thing, inasmuch as it admits of combination or of divi­ <lb/>
            sion. God, therefore, utters unmixed units : for the word <lb/>
            which he utters is not a beating of the air, being absolutely <lb/>
            mingled with nothing else whatever, but it is incorporeal and <lb/>
            naked, in no respect different from the unit. But we hear by <lb/>
            the number two ; for the breath being sent from the dominant <lb/>
            part of us through the artery called the trachea, is formed in <lb/>
            the mouth by the tongue, as by a kind of workman, and being <lb/>
            borne outward, and mingled with its kindred air, and having <lb/>
            struck it thus harmoniously, completes the mixture of the two <note type="footnote"> * Paalm lxi. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="360"/>
            powers; for that which sounds together by a combination of <lb/>
            different noises is at first adapted to a divisible duad, having <lb/>
            one sharp and one flat tone : very beautifully, therefore, did he <lb/>
            oppose one just reason to the multitude of unjust reasons, less <lb/>
            indeed in number, but superior in power, in order that the <lb/>
            worse of the two might not, like a'weight put in a scale, weigh <lb/>
            down the other ; but that, by the power of the weight of the <lb/>
            better one in the opposite scale it might have its lightness <lb/>
            detected, and so be weakened.</p>
          <p>XIX. But what is the meaning of the sentence, "Noah <lb/>
            found grace in the sight of the Lord God ?" Let us now con­ <lb/>
            sider this : of those who find anything, some are finding what <lb/>
            they formerly had and have lost; and some are discovering <lb/>
            what they never had before, and now possess for the first time. <lb/>
            Accordingly, those men who occupy themselves with the inves­ <lb/>
            tigation of appropriate names, are accustomed to call the latter <lb/>
            kind finding (<foreign xml:lang="grc">εὕϱεσις</foreign>), and the former kind re-finding (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀνεύϱεσις</foreign>). <lb/>
            Of the former species we have a conspicuous example afforded <lb/>
            us in the injunctions given about the great vow.* Now a vow <lb/>
            is a request for good things from God; and the spirit of the <lb/>
            great vow is to believe that God himself is the cause of good <lb/>
            things from himself, without anyone else ever co-operating with <lb/>
            him, of the things which may appear to be beneficial, neither <lb/>
            the earth as fruitful, nor the rain as helping to promote the <lb/>
            growth of seeds and plants, nor the air as calculated to nourish <lb/>
            mail, nor agriculture as the cause of production, nor the skill <lb/>
            of the physician as the cause of health, nor marriage as the <lb/>
            cause of the procreation of children : for all these things receive <lb/>
            changes and alterations through the power of God, to such a <lb/>
            decree and in such a way as often to have effects contrary to <lb/>
            their usual ones. Moses, therefore says, that this man is " holy <lb/>
            who nourishes the hair of his head the meaning of which is, <lb/>
            that he is holy who promotes the growth in the principal por­ <lb/>
            tion of himself of the principal shoots of the doctrines of virtue, <lb/>
            and who in a manner prides himself and takes delight in these <lb/>
            doctrines : but sometimes he loses them, a sort of whirlwind, as <lb/>
            it were, suddenly darting down upon the soul, and carrying off <lb/>
            everything that was good out of it; and this whirlwind is an <lb/>
            involuntary change, which pollutes the mind in a moment. <lb/>
            which Moses calls death. But nevertheless, when he has <note type="footnote"> * Numbers vi. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Numbers vi. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="361"/>
            afterwards got rid of this and become purified, he recovers and <lb/>
            recollects again, what for a time, he had forgotten, and finds <lb/>
            what he had lost, so that the days of his former change are not <lb/>
            included in the computation, either because such change is a <lb/>
            matter which cannot be reduced to calculation, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            is inconsistent with right reason and has no partnership with <lb/>
            prudence, or because it does not deserve to be taken into cal­ <lb/>
            culation; "for of such things," some ancient writer says, <lb/>
            " there is no account nor calculation taken."*</p>
          <p>XX. And we have often met with such things as previously <lb/>
            we had never seen even in a dream ; like a husbandman whom <lb/>
            some persons say while digging a hole for the purpose of plant­ <lb/>
            ing some fruit-bearing tree, found a treasure, meeting with <lb/>
            good fortune which he had never hoped for. Therefore Jacob, <lb/>
            the wrestler with God, when his father asked him the manner <lb/>
            in which he had acquired this knowledge, saying, " How didst <lb/>
            thou find this so quickly, my son ?" answered and said, " Be­ <lb/>
            cause the Lord my God brought it before me."t For when <lb/>
            God bestows on any one the treasures of his own wisdom with­ <lb/>
            out any toil or labour, then we, without having expected such <lb/>
            things, suddenly perceive that we have found a treasure of per­ <lb/>
            feet happiness.</p>
          <p>And it often happens to those who seek with great labour, <lb/>
            that they miss that for which they are seeking; while others, <lb/>
            who are seeking without any diligence, find with great ease <lb/>
            even things that they never thought of finding. For those <lb/>
            who are dull and slow in their souls, like men bereft of their <lb/>
            eyesight, find the labour which they devote to the contempla­ <lb/>
            tion of objects of science useless and wasted; while others, <lb/>
            through the richness of their natural endowments, find out im­ <lb/>
            measurable things without any investigation at all, by the help <lb/>
            of felicitous and well directed conjectures ; so that it would <lb/>
            seem that they attain their objects not in consequence of any <lb/>
            labour of their own, but because the things themselves do of <lb/>
            their own accord come to meet them and hasten to present <lb/>
            themselves to their view, and so give them the most accurate <lb/>
            comprehension of them. <note type="footnote"> * Alluding probably to Theocritus here, who says­ <lb/>
            "<foreign xml:lang="grc">Αμμες δ' οὕτε λόγου τίνος ἄξιοι</foreign>, ova' <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀρίθμητοι</foreign>.—xiv.17. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 20. </note> <pb n="362"/>

            and beautiful cities, which they had not built; houses full of <lb/>
            good things, which they had not filled ; cisterns cut out of the <lb/>
            solid rock, which they had not hewn; vineyards and olive <lb/>
            gardens, which they had not planted.*" Now, by cities and <lb/>
            houses, he here symbolically sketches out the generic and spe­ <lb/>
            cific virtues; for genus resembles a city, because it is marked <lb/>
            out in larger circumferences, and because it is common to <lb/>
            many individuals; and species resembles a house, because it is <lb/>
            more contracted and avoids community; and cisterns prepared <lb/>
            before-hand intimate the rewards which fall to the lot of some <lb/>
            for their labour, while they are given spontaneously to others, <lb/>
            being channels of heavenly and wholesome waters and well <lb/>
            prepared treasures for the preservation of the virtues before­ <lb/>
            mentioned, by means of which joy is shed over the perfect <lb/>
            heart, irradiating it all over with the light of truth. Again, <lb/>
            when Moses speaks of the vineyards, he means them as an <lb/>
            emblem of cheerfulness, and the olive gardens as a symbol of <lb/>
            light.</p>
          <p>Happy, therefore, are they who, suffering something like <lb/>
            those persons who awoke up out of deep sleep, on a sudden, <lb/>
            without any labour or exertion on their part, behold the world <lb/>
            before them; and miserable are they to whom it happens to be <lb/>
            eagerly contentious for objects to which they are not fitted by <lb/>
            nature, being full of a contentious spirit, which is the most <lb/>
            grievous of diseases. For, in addition to failing in the object <lb/>
            which they are desirous of attaining, they do further incur great <lb/>
            disgrace with no slight injury, like ships which are attempting <lb/>
            to make their way by sea against opposing winds; for they, in <lb/>
            addition to being unable to proceed in their course towards the <lb/>
            point to which they are hastening, are very often upset with <lb/>
            their crews and their cargoes, and so cause pain to their friends <lb/>
            and pleasure to their enemies.</p>
          <p>XXII. Therefore the law says that some persons, having <lb/>
            made a violent effort, went up to the mountain, " And the <lb/>
            Amorites came forth who dwell on that mountain, and wounded <lb/>
            them, as bees might have done, and pursued them from Seir <lb/>
            even to Hormah."t For it follows of necessity that those <lb/>
            persons who, being by nature unfitted for the comprehension <lb/>
            of arts, if by making violent efforts they do something in them, <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy vi. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy i. 43. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="363"/>
            not only fail of attaining their end, but also incur disgrace; <lb/>
            and those who voluntarily, but still without any deliberate con­ <lb/>
            sent of their mind, do something that they ought to do, putting <lb/>
            a sort of constraint on their own voluntary principle, do not <lb/>
            succeed, but are wounded and harassed by their own con­ <lb/>
            sciences.</p>
          <p>So also those who restore deposits of small value in the hope <lb/>
            of having larger deposits entrusted to them, which they may be <lb/>
            able to appropriate, you would call men of good faith ; and yet <lb/>
            even when they are restoring the deposits, they put a great <lb/>
            constraint on their natural faithlessness, by which it is to be <lb/>
            hoped, they will be unceasingly tormented.</p>
          <p>And do not all those who offer but a spurious kind of worship <lb/>
            to the only wise God, putting on a profession of a rigid life like <lb/>
            a dress on a magnificent stage, merely with the object of <lb/>
            making a display before the assembled spectators, having im­ <lb/>
            posture rather than piety in their souls, do not they, I say, <lb/>
            stretch themselves on the rack as it were, and torment them­ <lb/>
            selves, compelling even the truth itself to assume a false ap­ <lb/>
            pearance. Therefore, they being for a brief period over­ <lb/>
            shadowed with the emblems of superstition, which is the great <lb/>
            hindrance to holiness, and a great injury to those who have it <lb/>
            and to those who associate with it; after that again stripping <lb/>
            off their disguise, display their naked hypocrisy. And then <lb/>
            like men, convicted of being aliens, they are looked upon as <lb/>
            enemies, having entered themselves as citizens of that noblest <lb/>
            of cities-virtue, while they have really no connection with it. <lb/>
            For whatever is violent (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βίαιον</foreign>) is also of short duration, as <lb/>
            its very name imports, since it closely resembles short (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βαιὸν</foreign>). <lb/>
            And the ancients used the two words (<foreign xml:lang="grc">βαιὸν</foreign>) and (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὀλιγοχϱόνιον</foreign>) <lb/>
            of short duration as synonymous.</p>
          <p>XXIII. We must now consider the question which is meant <lb/>
            by " Noah found grace in the sight of the Lord God." ✽ Is <lb/>
            the meaning of what is here expressed this, that he received <lb/>
            grace, or that he was accounted worthy of grace ? The former <lb/>
            idea it is not natural for us to entertain ; for what was given <lb/>
            to him beyond what was given to all, as one may say, not only <lb/>
            to all concrete natures only, but to all elementary and simple <lb/>
            natures which have been accounted worthy of divine grace? <lb/>
            But the second interpretation has a reason in it which is not <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="364"/>
            altogether inconsistent, that the cause of all things, judges <lb/>
            those persons worthy of his gifts, who do not corrupt the divine <lb/>
            impression which has been stamped upon them, namely, the <lb/>
            most sacred mind, with disgraceful practices; still perhaps even <lb/>
            this is not the true meaning of the words. For what kind of <lb/>
            person must he be who would be accounted before God to be <lb/>
            worthy of his grace ? I indeed think that the whole world put <lb/>
            together could scarcely attain to such a pitch, and yet the world <lb/>
            is the first, and greatest, and most perfect of all the works of <lb/>
            God. May it not then perhaps be better to understand this <lb/>
            expression as meaning that the virtuous man being fond of <lb/>
            investigating things, and eager for learning, amid all the dif­ <lb/>
            ferent things that he has investigated, has found this one most <lb/>
            certain fact, that all things that exist, the earth, the water, the <lb/>
            air, the fire, the sun, the stars, the heaven, all animals and <lb/>
            plants whatever, are the grace of God.</p>
          <p>But God has given nothing to himself, for he has no need <lb/>
            of anything ; but he has given the world to the world, and its <lb/>
            parts he has bestowed on themselves and on one another, and <lb/>
            also on the universe, and without having judged anything to <lb/>
            be worthy of grace, (for he gives all his good things without <lb/>
            grudging to the universe and to its parts), he merely has regard <lb/>
            to his own everlasting goodness, thinking the doing good to be <lb/>
            a line of conduct suitable to his own happy and blessed nature ; <lb/>
            so that if any one were to ask me, what was the cause of the <lb/>
            creation of the world, having learnt from Moses, I should <lb/>
            answer, that the goodness of the living God, being the most im­ <lb/>
            portant of his graces, is in itself the cause.</p>
          <p>XXIV. But here we must observe that Moses says, that <lb/>
            " Noah pleased " the powers of the living God, " the Lord and <lb/>
            God," but that he tells us that Moses himself pleased the <lb/>
            Being who is attended by those powers as his body guard, and <lb/>
            who, without them, is conceived only according to his essence. <lb/>
            For it is said here, speaking in the person of God, " Because <lb/>
            thou hast found grace in my sight," * pointing out himself <lb/>
            instead of any one else whatever. Thus, therefore, he who <lb/>
            exists himself by himself alone, thinks the exceeding wisdom <lb/>
            which is found in Moses worthy of grace, and that other wis­ <lb/>
            dom which was formed on the model of his, he considers of an <lb/>
            inferior class, and more a wisdom of species, as consisting of <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 17. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="365"/>
            subordinate powers, according to which he is both Lord and <lb/>
            God, and ruler and benefactor.</p>
          <p>But another mind attached to the body and the slave of the <lb/>
            passions, having been sold as slave to the chief cook,* that <lb/>
            is to say to the pleasure of our compound being, and being <lb/>
            castrated and mutilated of all the masculine and generative <lb/>
            parts of the soul, being afflicted with a want of all good <lb/>
            practices, and being incapable of receiving the divine voice, <lb/>
            being also separated and cut off from the sacred assembly, in <lb/>
            which conferences and discussions about virtue are continually <lb/>
            being brought up, is conducted into the prison of the passions, <lb/>
            and finds grace, (a grace more inglorious than clishonour), with <lb/>
            the keeper of the prison.†</p>
          <p>For these men are properly called prisoners, not those who <lb/>
            after they have been condemned at the judgment seat by the <lb/>
            legitimate magistrates, or by judges formally appointed, are <lb/>
            led away by the officers into the place appointed for malefactors; <lb/>
            but those in whom nature has condemned the disposition of <lb/>
            their souls, men who are full of intemperance, and cowardice, <lb/>
            and injustice, and impiety, and innumerable other evils; but <lb/>
            the steward, and keeper, and guardian of these men, is the <lb/>
            keeper of the prison, a composition and combination of all <lb/>
            kinds of various wickednesses, united together into one mass, <lb/>
            to please whom is the greatest of punishments.</p>
          <p>But some people who do not perceive this, being deceived <lb/>
            with respect to what is injurious to such a degree, as to look <lb/>
            upon it as advantageous, come to him with great joy, and <lb/>
            offer themselves as his body-guards, that being accounted <lb/>
            faithful by him, they may become his lieutenants and successors <lb/>
            in the guardianship of involuntary and voluntary offences; <lb/>
            but do thou, 0 my soul, thinking such an office and magistracy <lb/>
            as that, more grievous than the most laborious slavery, adopt, <lb/>
            as far as you can, an unrestrained, and unconfined, and free <lb/>
            system of life, and if you are caught by the baits of passion, <lb/>
            endure rather to be a prisoner yourself, than the keeper of a <lb/>
            prison ; for then if you suffer distress, and groan aloud, you <lb/>
            will obtain pity; but if you give yourself up to ambition of <lb/>
            great posts, and to a covetousness of honour, you will receive <lb/>
            that pleasant and greatest evil of being keeper of the prison, <lb/>
            by which you will be influenced the whole of your life. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxix 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxix. 21. </note> <pb n="366"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXV. Reject therefore with all your might all idea of <lb/>
            pleasing the keepers of the prison ; but on the contrary, with <lb/>
            all your ability and all your earnestness, labour to please him <lb/>
            who is the cause of all things ; and if you are unable to do so, <lb/>
            (for the greatness of his dignity is exceeding high), at all events <lb/>
            advance, without ever turning back, towards his powers, and <lb/>
            present yourself to them as their suppliant, until they admit­ <lb/>
            ting the continual assiduity and sincerity of your service, place <lb/>
            you in the ranks of those who have pleased them, as they did <lb/>
            Noah, of whose descendants Moses has made a most admirable <lb/>
            and novel catalogue ; for he says, " These are the generations <lb/>
            of Noah: Noah was a just man, being perfect in his gene­ <lb/>
            ration, and Noah pleased God"; for the descendants of the <lb/>
            compound being were naturally compound beings also them­ <lb/>
            selves ; for horses do of necessity beget horses, and lions beget <lb/>
            lions, bulls become the parents of bulls, and so too men beget <lb/>
            men; but such things are not the appropriate offspring of a <lb/>
            good mind; the progeny of that are the virtues before <lb/>
            mentioned, namely the being a man, the being just, the being <lb/>
            perfect, the pleasing God, which last particular, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            is the crowning one, and as it were the boundary of perfect <lb/>
            happiness, is enumerated last of all.</p>
          <p>But there is one kind of creation, which is a sort of con­ <lb/>
            ducting and travelling from that which does not exist to <lb/>
            existence. This is the one which plants, and animals do of <lb/>
            necessity use; and there is another kind, which is a transition <lb/>
            and change from a better genus to a worse species, which Moses <lb/>
            mentions when he says, "These are the generations of Jacob ; <lb/>
            Joseph when he was seventeen years of age, was keeping the <lb/>
            sheep with his brethren, being a youth with the sons of Billah, <lb/>
            and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives. "t For <lb/>
            when this reason inclined to meditation and devoted to <lb/>
            learning, was driven down from its more divine speculations, <lb/>
            human and mortal opinions, then Joseph, the companion of <lb/>
            the body, and of all the things which pertain to the body was <lb/>
            born, being still but a youth, even though in the lapse of <lb/>
            time he may become greyheaded, as being one who never <lb/>
            listened to any older discourse or opinions, which the com­ <lb/>
            panions of Moses acquired as the most useful possessions for <lb/>
            themselves and their disciples. On this account it seems to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxvii. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="367"/>
            me that Moses wishing to describe his figure and to give a <lb/>
            more accurate idea of his appearance, so as to make it known, <lb/>
            introduced him as tending his father's sheep, not in the com­ <lb/>
            pany of any one of his father's legitimate sons, but with his <lb/>
            illegitimate brethren, who, being the sons of concubines, derive <lb/>
            their name from the inferior sex, that of the women, and not <lb/>
            from the superior sex, that, namely of the man ; for they here <lb/>
            are called the sons of Jacob's wives, Billah and Zilpah, and <lb/>
            not the sons of their father Israel.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And one may here very fitly raise the question for <lb/>
            what reason it was that after mentioning the perfection of Noah <lb/>
            in virtue, he then immediately adds that " the earth was become <lb/>
            corrupt in the sight of God, and was filled with wickedness."* <lb/>
            But perhaps it is not difficult to arrive at a solution of this <lb/>
            doubt, for any one who is not exceedingly ignorant of all in­ <lb/>
            struction. We must say therefore, that when an incorruptible <lb/>
            species arises in the soul, the mortal part is immediately de­ <lb/>
            stroyed ; for the birth of virtuous studies is the death of dis­ <lb/>
            graceful ones, since also when light shines forth darkness dis­ <lb/>
            appears. On this account, in the law of leprosy, it is most <lb/>
            expressly enjoined that " If the living skin arise in the leper, he <lb/>
            shall be polluted ;"t and further ratifying this same injunction, <lb/>
            and as it were setting a seal to it, he adds, " and the flesh <lb/>
            which is sound shall pollute him," delivering this injunction in <lb/>
            opposition to what is natural or usual: for all men think the <lb/>
            things that are sick the pollution of those that are in health, <lb/>
            and those that are dead the pollution of the living, and not, on <lb/>
            the contrary, that the healthy and the living are the pollution <lb/>
            of the sick and of the dead, but rather, they account them their <lb/>
            salvation. But the lawgiver being full of the most modern <lb/>
            wisdom in everything, has this peculiarity in his expositions, <lb/>
            that he teaches that the healthy and the living are the causes <lb/>
            of our not being pure from pollution; for the healthy and living <lb/>
            complexion in the soul is truly conviction which rises up against <lb/>
            it: when this conviction rises up, it makes a catalogue of all <lb/>
            the offences of the soul, and reproaching it with them, and <lb/>
            looking sternly at it, it is scarcely able to be stopped in its <lb/>
            attacks upon it; and the soul being convicted recognises all its <lb/>
            actions by which it has offended against right reason, and per­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis vi. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xiii. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="368"/>
            ceives that it is foolish, and intemperate, and unjust, and fall <lb/>
            of pollutions.</p>
          <p>XXVII. On which account Moses also establishes a most <lb/>
            extraordinary law, in which he enjoins that " the man who is <lb/>
            in part leprous shall be accounted impure, but that he who is <lb/>
            wholly, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head over­ <lb/>
            whelmed with leprosy, shall be considered pure ;"* for any one <lb/>
            else, I apprehend, reasoning from probability, would say the <lb/>
            exact contrary, and would think that the leprosy which was <lb/>
            contracted, and which extended over only a small portion of <lb/>
            the body, was less impure, but that the leprosy which was dif. <lb/>
            fused, so as to spread over the whole body was more impure : <lb/>
            but Moses here, as it appears to me, uses this symbolical ex­ <lb/>
            pression to intimate this most undeniable truth, that uninten­ <lb/>
            tional misdeeds, even if they be of the greatest enormity, are <lb/>
            not deserving of blame, and are pure, inasmuch as they have <lb/>
            not conscience, that terrible accuser, to testify against them: <lb/>
            but that intentional offences, even if they do not extend over a <lb/>
            wide surface, being convicted by the judge who passes sentence <lb/>
            against the soul, are rightly accounted unholy, and polluted, <lb/>
            and impure.</p>
          <p>This leprosy, therefore, being of a twofold character, and <lb/>
            putting forth two complexions, signifies voluntary depravity; <lb/>
            for the soul, though it has healthy, and vivifying, and right <lb/>
            reason in itself, does not use it for the preservation of its good <lb/>
            things, but surrendering itself to persons unskilled in naviga­ <lb/>
            tion, it overturns the whole bark of life, which might have <lb/>
            been saved in calm fine weather; but when it changes so as to <lb/>
            assume one uniform white appearance, it displays an involun­ <lb/>
            tary change; since the mind, entirely deprived of the power <lb/>
            of reasoning, not having left in it one single seed to beget <lb/>
            understanding, like a man in a mist or in deep darkness, sees <lb/>
            nothing that ought to be done; but, like a blind man, fall­ <lb/>
            ing without seeing his way before him into all kinds of error, <lb/>
            endures continual falls and disasters one after another, in spite <lb/>
            of all its efforts.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. And like this is the injunction given respecting <lb/>
            the house in which it happens that leprosy often arises; for <lb/>
            Moses says that, " If there be a taint of leprosy in the house, <lb/>
            the owner shall come, and shall tell it to the priest, saying <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xiii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="369"/>
            there is something like a taint of leprosy has been seen by me <lb/>
            in my bouse,"* and presently he adds, "And the priest shall <lb/>
            command him to dismantle his house, before the priest enters <lb/>
            into the house to see it, and all the things that are in the house <lb/>
            shall not be impure ; and after that the priest shall enter the <lb/>
            house to examine it." Therefore, before the priest enters <lb/>
            in, the things in the house are pure ; but after he has entered <lb/>
            inn from that time forth they are all impure. And yet the <lb/>
            contrary would have been natural, that when a man thoroughly <lb/>
            purified and perfect, who is in the habit of offering up prayers <lb/>
            and purifications, and sacrifices for all the people come into a <lb/>
            house, all that is therein would be improved by his presence, <lb/>
            and would become pure from having been impure ; but now <lb/>
            they do not even remain in the same condition as before, <lb/>
            but they are brought into a worse state by the arrival of the <lb/>
            priest.</p>
          <p>But whether this is consistent with the literal and obvious <lb/>
            order of the words, those men may inquire who are in the habit <lb/>
            of, and fond of pursuing such Investigations ; but we must affirm <lb/>
            distinctly, that no one thing can be more consistent with another <lb/>
            than the fact, that when the priest enters in, all the things in the <lb/>
            house should be polluted ; for as long as the divine word has not <lb/>
            come to our souls as to a hearth of hospitality, all its actions <lb/>
            are blameless ; for the overseer, or the father, or the teacher, <lb/>
            or whatever else it may be fit to entitle the priest, by whom <lb/>
            alone it is possible for it to be admonished and chastened, is <lb/>
            at a distance: and those persons are to be pardoned who do <lb/>
            wrong from inexperience, out of ignorance what they ought <lb/>
            to do: for they do not look upon their deeds in the light of <lb/>
            sins, but even sometimes they believe that they are doing right <lb/>
            in cases in which they are erring greatly; but when the real <lb/>
            priest, conviction, enters our hearts, like a most pure ray of <lb/>
            light, then we think that the designs which we have cherished <lb/>
            within our souls are not pure, and we see that our actions are <lb/>
            liable to blame, and deserving of reproach, though we did them <lb/>
            through ignorance of what was right. All these things, there­ <lb/>
            fore, the priest, that is to say, conviction, pollutes, and orders <lb/>
            that they should be taken away and stripped off, in order that <lb/>
            he may see the abode of the soul pure,! and, if there are an' <lb/>
            diseases in it, that he may heal them. <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xiv. 35. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Ibid. </note> <lb/>

            </p>
          <p>XXIX. And the woman who met the prophet,* in the book <lb/>
            of Kings, resembles this fact: " And she is a widow;" not <lb/>
            meaning by that, as we generally use the word, a woman when <lb/>
            she is bereft of her husband, but that she is so, from being free <lb/>
            from those passions which corrupt and destroy the soul, as <lb/>
            Thamar is represented by Moses. For she also being a widow, <lb/>
            was commanded to sit down in the house of the father, <lb/>
            the only Saviour;† on whose account, having forsaken for <lb/>
            ever the company and society of men, she is at a distance <lb/>
            from and widowhood of all human pleasures, and receives a <lb/>
            divine seed ; and being filled with the seeds of virtue, she con­ <lb/>
            ceives, and is in travail of virtuous actions. And when she <lb/>
            has brought them forth, she carries off the prize against her <lb/>
            adversaries, and is enrolled as victorious, bearing the palm as <lb/>
            the emblem of her victory.</p>
          <p>For the name Thamar, being interpreted, means the palm- <lb/>
            tree. And every soul that is beginning to be widowed and <lb/>
            devoid of evils, says to the prophet, " 0, man of God ! hast <lb/>
            thou come to me to remind me of my iniquity and of my <lb/>
            sin? " ‡ For he being inspired, and entering into the soul, <lb/>
            and being filled with heavenly love, and being amazingly ex­ <lb/>
            cited by the intolerable stimulus of heaven-inflicted frenzy, <lb/>
            works in the soul a recollection of its ancient iniquities and <lb/>
            offences : not in order that it may commit such again,- but <lb/>
            that, greatly lamenting and bitterly bewailing its former error, <lb/>
            it may hate its own offspring, and reject them with aversion, <lb/>
            and may follow the admonitions of the word of God, the inter­ <lb/>
            preter and prophet of his will. For the men of old used to <lb/>
            call the prophets sometimes men of God, and sometimes <lb/>
            seers,§ affixing appropriate and becoming names to their <lb/>
            enthusiasm, and inspiration, and to the foreknowledge of affairs <lb/>
            which they enjoyed.</p>
          <p>XXX. Very properly, therefore, the most sacred Moses says <lb/>
            that, the earth was corrupted at that time when the virtues of <lb/>
            the just Noah were made manifest: " And the whole earth," <lb/>
            says he, " was corrupted, because all flesh had corrupted his <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐτου̃</foreign>) way upon the earth." || Now to some persons this <lb/>
            expression will seem to have been incorrectly used, and that <lb/>
            the consistency with the context, and the truth of the fact will <note type="footnote"> * 1 Kings xvii. 10 </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxxviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ I Kings xvii 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> § 1 Samuel ix. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> || Genesis vi. 12. </note> <lb/>
            <pb n="371"/>
            <lb/>
            require that we should read rather that, " All flesh had cor- <lb/>
            rupted its (<foreign xml:lang="grc">αὺτῆς</foreign>) way upon the earth." For it does not agree<lb/>
            with the feminine noun "flesh" (<foreign xml:lang="grc">τη̃ σαϱϰὶ</foreign>), if we subjoin not agree a<lb/>
            masculine case, the word <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὺτοῦ</foreign> in connection with it. But<lb/>
            perhaps, Moses as does mean here to speak of the alone<lb/>
            as corrupting his way upon the earth, so that he deserves to be<lb/>
            considered to have erred in the expression wich he has used,<lb/>
            but rather to speak of the things of the flech, wich is cor-<lb/>
            rupted, and of that otehr being whose way the flesh endeavours<lb/>
            to injure and to corrupt</p>
          <p>So that we should explain this expression thus:—All flesh<lb/>
            corrupted the perfect way of the everlasting and incorruptible<lb/>
            being wich conducts to God. And know that this way is<lb/>
            wisdom. For the mind being guided by wisdom, while the<lb/>
            road is straight and level and easy, proceeds along it to the<lb/>
            end: and the end of this road is the knowledge and under-<lb/>
            stading of God. But every companion of the flesh hates and<lb/>
            repudiates, and endeavours to corrupt this way; for there is no<lb/>
            one thing so much at variance with another, as knowledge is<lb/>
            at variance with the pleasure of the flesh. According, the<lb/>
            earthly Edom is always fighting with those who wish to pro-<lb/>
            ceed by this road, wich is the royal road for those who partake<lb/>
            of the faculty of seeing who are called Israel; for the inter-<lb/>
            pretation of the name Edom, is "earthly," and he labours with<lb/>
            all earnestness, and by every means in his power, and by<lb/>
            threats, to hinder them from this road, and to make it pathless<lb/>
            and impracticable foe ever.</p>
          <p><lb/>
            XXXI. Therefor the ambassadors who are sent speak as<lb/>
            follows:—" We will pass on through thy land; we will not<lb/>
            pass through thy fields nor through thy vineyards: we will not<lb/>
            drink water from thy cistern; we will proceed by the royal<lb/>
            road; we will not turn aside out of the way, to the right hand,<lb/>
            nor to the left, until we have passed over thy borders. But<lb/>
            Edom answered and said,. Thou shalt not pass through my<lb/>
            land: and if thou dost, I will comme against thee in battle<lb/>
            to meet thee. And the childre of Israel said unto him.<lb/>
            We will pass by thy mountain; but if I or my cattle drink<lb/>
            of thy water, I will pay thee the price thereof. But it is<lb/>
            of no consequence, we will pass by thy mountain. And he<lb/>
            said," Thou shalt not pass through my land."* <note type="footnote"> * Nlumbers xx. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> B B 2 </note> <pb n="372"/>
            </p>
          <p>It is said of some man of old time, that when he saw a <lb/>
            sumptuous procession properly equipped passing by, he looked <lb/>
            towards one of his acquaintances and said, " My friends, see <lb/>
            how many things there are of which I have no need," in a very <lb/>
            few words uttering what was truly a great and heavenly boast. <lb/>
            What dost thou say ? Were you crowned as conqueror in the <lb/>
            Olympic games in opposition to all the wealth arrayed against <lb/>
            you; and were you so to that degree there that you took <lb/>
            nothing from thence for your enjoyment or for your use ? It <lb/>
            is a marvellous statement, but the sentiment is more admirable <lb/>
            still, which advanced to such a degree of strength, as to be able <lb/>
            without any extraordinary exertion, nevertheless to carry off <lb/>
            the victory by force.</p>
          <p>XXXII. But it is not allowed to one man alone to boast <lb/>
            before Moses who has been instructed in the highest perfection <lb/>
            of wisdom, but it belongs to the whole of a most populous <lb/>
            nation. And this is the proof of that fact. The soul of every <lb/>
            one of his friends felt confidence and was bold towards the king <lb/>
            of all the apparent good things, the earthly Edom ; for in fact <lb/>
            all earthly good things are good only in appearance ; they then <lb/>
            I say were bold, so as to say, “ I will now pass by thy land." <lb/>
            Oh, the magnanimous and sublime promise! Tell me, will <lb/>
            ye be able to surmount, to pass by, to run past all these things <lb/>
            which on earth appear to be and are believed to be good ? <lb/>
            And is there nothing which will be able to check and restrain <lb/>
            your forward advance by the power with which it resists you ? <lb/>
            And when you have beheld all the treasures of riches one after <lb/>
            another, and all full, will ye turn from them with aversion, <lb/>
            and avert your eyes from them ? And will ye look down upon the <lb/>
            dignities of your ancestors, and on those which come to your­ <lb/>
            selves from your father and your mother, and on their nobility <lb/>
            which is so celebrated in the mouths of the multitude ? And <lb/>
            will ye forsake the glory for which men are ready to barter <lb/>
            everything, leaving it behind as if it were something most <lb/>
            utterly valueless ? What more shall I say ? Will ye dis­ <lb/>
            regard the health of the body, and the accurate perfection of <lb/>
            the outward senses, and beauty, which is an object of contention <lb/>
            to many, and strength such as no one can oppose, and all those <lb/>
            other things by which the house or the tomb of the soul, or <lb/>
            whatever else one ought to call it is adorned, will ye, I say, <lb/>
            disregard all these things, so far as not to class any one of <lb/>
             <pb n="373"/>
            them among good things? These are mighty deeds of bold­ <lb/>
            ness for a heavenly and celestial soul, which has utterly for­ <lb/>
            saken the regions of earth, and which has been drawn up on <lb/>
            high, and has its abode among the divine natures. For being <lb/>
            filled with the sight of. the genuine and incorruptible good <lb/>
            things, it very naturally repudiates those which only last a day <lb/>
            and are spurious.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. What is the advantage then of passing over all <lb/>
            the mortal advantages of mortal man, and passing them by too, <lb/>
            not in accordance with right reason, but as some do through <lb/>
            their hesitation, or sluggishness, or inexperience ; for everything <lb/>
            is not honoured everywhere, but different things are esteemed <lb/>
            by different persons. On this account, iloses wishing to teach <lb/>
            further, that they had become by correctness of reason inclined <lb/>
            to despise what was said, adds to the words, " I will pass by," <lb/>
            the further description, “ through your land." For this is ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly necessary, that when surrounded by an abundance of <lb/>
            those things which are usually accounted advantages, we should <lb/>
            avoid being taken prisoners by any of the toils which are spread <lb/>
            by each separate pleasure ; and that like fire, we should be able <lb/>
            at one onset to break through their attacks which are so con­ <lb/>
            tinually armed against us.</p>
          <p>The Israelites say then that they will pass by this way, but <lb/>
            that they will not pass any longer through the fields and vine­ <lb/>
            yards ; for it would be doting simplicity to pass by all the <lb/>
            plants in the soul worthy of cultivation and producing eatable <lb/>
            fruit, that is to say virtuous discourses and praiseworthy actions. <lb/>
            For it would be proper rather to remain, and to gather the fruit, <lb/>
            and to feed on it to satiety. For nothing is more beautiful than <lb/>
            an insatiable cheerfulness amid perfect virtues, of which cheer­ <lb/>
            fulness, the aforesaid vineyards are the symbol. But we, on <lb/>
            whom God pours and showers his fountains of good things from <lb/>
            above, we drank from that cistern, and we were seeking scanty <lb/>
            moisture beneath the earth, while the heaven was raining upon <lb/>
            us, from above without ceasing, the more excellent food of nectar <lb/>
            and ambrosia, far better than that celebrated in the fables of <lb/>
            the poets.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Moreover, should we while draining draughts <lb/>
            stored up by the contrivance of men through distrust, seek a <lb/>
            refuge and place of escape, where the Saviour of the universe <lb/>
            has opened to us his heavenly treasury for our use and enjoy­ <lb/>
             <pb n="374"/>
            ment? For Moses, the hierophant, prays that " the Lord may <lb/>
            open to us his good treasure, his heavenly one, to give us his <lb/>
            rain,”* and the prayers of the man who loves God are sure to <lb/>
            obtain a hearing. And what does he say who neither thinks <lb/>
            the heaven, or the rain, or a cistern, or in fact anything what­ <lb/>
            ever in all creation sufficient to nourish him, but who goes <lb/>
            beyond all these things, and relating what he has suffered, says, <lb/>
            " The God who has nourished me from my youth up.”† Does <lb/>
            not this man appear to you not to think all the collections of <lb/>
            water under the earth put together worthy even of looking at ? <lb/>
            Nor therefore would he drink out of a cistern to whom God <lb/>
            gives draughts of unmixed wine; at one time, by the ministrations <lb/>
            of some angel whom he has thought worthy to act as cup- <lb/>
            bearer, and at another time by his own means, placing no one <lb/>
            between the giver and the receiver.</p>
          <p>Let us then, without any delay, attempt to proceed by the <lb/>
            royal road, since we think fit to pass by all earthly things ; and <lb/>
            the royal road is that of which there is no private individual <lb/>
            in the world who is master, but he alone who is also the only <lb/>
            true king. And this is, as I said a little while ago, wisdom, <lb/>
            by which alone suppliant souls can find a way of escaping to <lb/>
            the uncreate God ; for it is natural that one who goes without <lb/>
            any hindrance along the royal road, will never feel weariness <lb/>
            before he meets with the king.</p>
          <p>But, then, those who have come near to him recognise his <lb/>
            blessedness and their own deficiency ; for Abraham, when he <lb/>
            had placed himself very near to God, immediately perceived <lb/>
            that he was but dust and ashes. ‡ And let them turn away out <lb/>
            of the royal road, neither to the right hand nor to the left, but <lb/>
            let them advance along the middle of it; for any deviation in <lb/>
            either direction is blameable, as that on the one side has a ten­ <lb/>
            dency to excess and that on the other side to deficiency; for <lb/>
            the right hand is, in this instance, no less blameable than the <lb/>
            left hand. In the case of those who live according to impulse, <lb/>
            the right hand is temerity and the left hand cowardice. As <lb/>
            regards those who are illiberal in the management of money, or <lb/>
            the right hand stands stinginess, and on the left hand extrava­ <lb/>
            gant prodigality ; and those men, who are very subtle in calcu­ <lb/>
            lating, judge craftiness to be desirable and simplicity to be a <lb/>
            thing to be shunned. Again, some persons incline towards <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xxviii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlviii. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xviii. 27. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="375"/>
            superstition as being placed on the right hand, and flee from <lb/>
            impiety as a thing to be avoided on the left.</p>
          <p>XXXV. But that we may not, through deviating from the <lb/>
            right road, be compelled to yield to one of two rival faults, let <lb/>
            us desire and pray to be able to proceed straight along the <lb/>
            middle of the road. Now, the middle between temerity and <lb/>
            cowardice, is courage ; the mean between profuse extravagance <lb/>
            and illiberal stinginess, is temperance; that between crafty <lb/>
            unscrupulousness and folly, is prudence; and the proper path <lb/>
            between superstition and impiety, is piety. These lie in the <lb/>
            middle between the deviations on either side, and are all roads <lb/>
            easily travelled, and level, and plain, which we must walk upon <lb/>
            not with our bodily organs, but with the motions of a soul con­ <lb/>
            tinually desiring what is best.</p>
          <p>At this, the earthly Edom, being excessively indignant (for <lb/>
            he is afraid of the overthrow and confusion of his own doctrines), <lb/>
            will threaten us with irreconcilable wars, if we attempt to force <lb/>
            our way along it, cutting down and clearing away continually <lb/>
            as we advance the fruitful trees of his soul, which he planted <lb/>
            for the destruction of wisdom, but has not gathered the fruit <lb/>
            thereof; for he says, " Thou shalt not pass by me ; and if thou <lb/>
            dost, I will come forth in battle against thee to meet thee." <lb/>
            But let us regard none of his threats, but make answer that we <lb/>
            will pass by his mountain; that is to say, we being accustomed <lb/>
            to associate with high and sublime powers and to investigate <lb/>
            everything according to its true definition, and being used to <lb/>
            inquire into the reason of everything whatever, of every kind, <lb/>
            by means of which the knowledge is attained of what anything <lb/>
            is, hold in utter contempt everything which is external and <lb/>
            which affects the body alone; for such things are lowly and <lb/>
            grovelling in the ground, dear indeed to you, but hated by us, <lb/>
            for which reason we will not have anything to do with any one <lb/>
            of them. For if, as the proverb says, we only touch this with <lb/>
            the tip of our finger, we shall be giving honour and dignity to <lb/>
            yon ; for then you will give yourself airs and will boast, as if we <lb/>
            who are lovers of virtue had been brought over to you by the <lb/>
            allurements of pleasure.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. " For if," says Israel, " I and my cattle drink of <lb/>
            thy water, I will pay you a price for it." Not meaning by that <lb/>
            such price as is spoken of by the poets, money of silver or gold, <lb/>
            or anything else ; such among dealers is accustomed to be given <lb/>
             <pb n="376"/>
            to those who sell wares in exchange for their wares, but the <lb/>
            price will be the honour which he now claims; for, in reality, <lb/>
            every intemperate, or unjust, or cowardly man, when he sees <lb/>
            anyone who is more austere cither avoiding labour, or subdued <lb/>
            by gain, or yielding to any one of the allurements of pleasure, <lb/>
            rejoices and exults, and thinks that he himself has received <lb/>
            honour. And, moreover, going on in his rejoicing and display­ <lb/>
            ing his exultation to the multitude, he begins to philosophise <lb/>
            about his own errors as very unavoidable and not useless, saying <lb/>
            that if they were not of such a character, that respectable man, <lb/>
            so and so, would never have indulged in them.</p>
          <p>Let us, then, say to every wicked man, if we drink of thy <lb/>
            water, if we touch anything, whatever that is yours, owing to an <lb/>
            indiscreet impetuosity, we shall be giving you honour, and accept­ <lb/>
            ance, instead of dishonour and rejection (for these are what you <lb/>
            deserve to receive); and, in truth, the matters about which you <lb/>
            are anxious are absolutely nothing. Do you think that anything <lb/>
            mortal has any real being and existence, and that it is not rather <lb/>
            something borne up and suspended by the rope of some false and <lb/>
            untrustworthy opinion, resting on empty air, and in no respect <lb/>
            differing from deceitful dreams? And if you are unwilling to <lb/>
            contemplate the fortunes of particular men, think upon the <lb/>
            changes, whether for the better or for the worse, of whole <lb/>
            countries and nations.</p>
          <p>At one time Greece was flourishing, but the Macedonians <lb/>
            took away the power of that land ; then, in turn, Macedonia <lb/>
            became mighty, but that, being divided into small portions be­ <lb/>
            came weak, until at last it was entirely extinguished. Before <lb/>
            the time of the Macedonians the Persians prospered, but one <lb/>
            day overthrew their exceeding and extensive prosperity. And <lb/>
            now the Parthians are more powerful than the Persians, who a <lb/>
            little while ago were their masters, ever were; and those who <lb/>
            were their subjects are now masters. Once, and for a very <lb/>
            long time, Egypt was a mighty empire, but its great dominion <lb/>
            and glory have passed away like a cloud. What has become <lb/>
            of the Ethiopians, and of Carthage, and of the kingdoms of <lb/>
            Libya ? Where now are the kings of Pontus ? What has be­ <lb/>
            come of Europe and Asia, and, in short, of the whole of the <lb/>
            inhabited world ? Is it not tossed up and down and agitated <lb/>
            like- a ship that is tossed by the sea, at one time enjoying a <lb/>
            fair wind and at another time being forced to battle against <lb/>
             <pb n="377"/>
            contrary gales ? For the divine Word brings round its opera­ <lb/>
            tions in a circle, which the common multitude of men call <lb/>
            fortune. And then, as it continually flows on among cities, and <lb/>
            nations, and countries, it overturns existing arrangements and <lb/>
            gives to one person what. has previously belonged to another, <lb/>
            changing the affairs of individuals only in point of time, in <lb/>
            order that the whole world may become, as it were, one city, <lb/>
            and enjoy the most excellent of constitutions, a democracy.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. No one, therefore, of all the objects of human <lb/>
            anxiety or of human labour, is of any importance or value ; but <lb/>
            every such thing is a mere shadow or breath, disappearing be­ <lb/>
            fore it can get any firm footing ; for it comes and then again it <lb/>
            departs, like the ebbing tide. For the sea, in its ebb and flow, <lb/>
            is at one time borne forwards with great violence, and roaring, <lb/>
            and noise, and overflowing its bounds makes a lake of what <lb/>
            has previously been dry land ; and, at another time, it recedes <lb/>
            and makes a large portion of what has been sea, dry land. In <lb/>
            the same manner, at times, prosperity overflows a mighty and <lb/>
            populous nation, but afterwards turns the impetuosity of its <lb/>
            stream in the opposite direction, and does not leave even the <lb/>
            slightest drop, so as to suffer no trace whatever to remain of <lb/>
            its former richness. But it is not everybody who receives the <lb/>
            complete and full meaning of these events, but only those re­ <lb/>
            ceive it who are accustomed always to proceed in accordance <lb/>
            with true and solid reason and limitation ; for we find the same <lb/>
            men saying both these things, " All the affairs of the created <lb/>
            world are absolutely nothing;" and, "We will go by thy <lb/>
            mountain." For it is impossible for one who is not in the <lb/>
            habit of using high and mountainous roads to repudiate all <lb/>
            mortal affairs, and to turn aside and change his paths for what <lb/>
            is immortal.</p>
          <p>Therefore the earthly Edom thinks it right to blockade the <lb/>
            heavenly and royal road of virtue, and the divine reason block­ <lb/>
            ades his road, and that of all who follow his opinions ; among <lb/>
            whom we must enroll Balaam, for he also is a child of the <lb/>
            earth, and not a shoot of heaven, and a proof of this is, that <lb/>
            he, being influenced by omens and false prophecies, not even <lb/>
            when the eye of his. soul, which had been closed, recovered its <lb/>
            sight, and " saw the angel of God standing against him in the <lb/>
            way;"* not even then did he turn back and desist from doing <note type="footnote"> it Numbers xxii. 31. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="378"/>
            wrong, but giving way to a mighty torrent of folly, he was <lb/>
            washed away and swallowed up by it.</p>
          <p>For then the diseases of the soul are truly not only difficult <lb/>
            of cure, but even utterly incurable, when, though conviction is <lb/>
            present to us (and this is the word of God, coming as his angel <lb/>
            and as our guide, and removing the obstacles before our feet, <lb/>
            so that we may travel without stumbling along the level road), <lb/>
            we nevertheless prefer our own indiscreet opinions, to the ex­ <lb/>
            planations and injunctions which he is accustomed to address <lb/>
            to us for our admonition, and for the chastening and regu­ <lb/>
            lating of our whole life. On this account he who is not per­ <lb/>
            suaded by, and who shows no respect to, conviction, when it <lb/>
            thus opposes him, will, in his turn, incur destruction with the <lb/>
            wounded,* whom the passions have wounded and overthrown; <lb/>
            and his calamity will be a most sufficient lesson for all those <lb/>
            who are not utterly impure, to endeavour to keep the judge, <lb/>
            that is within them, favourable to them, and he will be so if <lb/>
            they do not reverse what has been rightly decided by him.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE TILLING OF THE EARTH BY NOAH.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. " AND Noah began to be a husbandman ; and he planted <lb/>
            a vineyard, and he drank of the wine, and he was drunk in his <lb/>
            house.”† The generality of men not understanding the nature <lb/>
            of things, do also of necessity err with respect to the compo­ <lb/>
            sition of names ; for those who consider affairs anatomically, as <lb/>
            it were, are easily able to affix appropriate names to things, but <lb/>
            those who look at them in a confused and irregular way are in­ <lb/>
            capable of such accuracy. But Moses, through the exceeding <lb/>
            abundance of his knowledge of all things, was accustomed to <lb/>
            affix the most felicitous and expressive appellations to them. <lb/>
            Accordingly, in many passages of the law, we shall find this <lb/>
            opinion, which we have expressed, confirmed by the fact, and <lb/>
            not least in the passage which we have cited at the beginning <lb/>
            of this treatise, in which the just Noah is represented as a hus­ <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxxi. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ix. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="379"/>
            banaian. For what roan is there who is at all hasty in form­ <lb/>
            ing an opinion, who would not think that the being a husband <lb/>
            man (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωγία</foreign>), and the occupying one's self in cultivating the <lb/>
            ground <foreign xml:lang="grc">γη̃ς ἐγασία</foreign>), were the same thing? And yet in real <lb/>
            truth, not only are these things not the same, but they are even <lb/>
            very much separated from one another, so as to be opposed to, <lb/>
            and at variance with one another.</p>
          <p>For a man without any skill may labour at taking care of the <lb/>
            land; but if a man is called a husbandman, he, from his mere <lb/>
            name, is believed to be no unskilful man, but a farmer of expe­ <lb/>
            rience, inasmuch as his name (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωγὸς</foreign>) has been derived from <lb/>
            agricultural skill (<foreign xml:lang="grc">γεωιϰὴ τέχνη</foreign>), of which he is the namesake. <lb/>
            And besides all this, we must likewise consider this other point, <lb/>
            that the tiller of the ground (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ γη̃ς ἐγάτης</foreign>) looks only to one <lb/>
            end, namely, to his wages ; for he is altogether a hireling, and <lb/>
            has no care whatever to till the land well. But the husband­ <lb/>
            man (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ὁ γεωγὸς</foreign>) would be glad also to contribute something of <lb/>
            his own, and to spend in addition some of his private resources <lb/>
            for the sake of improving the soil, and of avoiding blame from <lb/>
            those who understand the business ; for his desire is to derive <lb/>
            his revenues every year not from any other source, but from <lb/>
            his agricultural labours, when they have been brought into a <lb/>
            productive state. He therefore occupies himself with improving <lb/>
            the character of wild trees, and making them fruitful, and with <lb/>
            further improving the character of fruitful trees by his care, and <lb/>
            with reducing by pruning those branches which through super­ <lb/>
            fluity of nourishment are too luxuriant, and with inducing those <lb/>
            which are contracted and crowded to grow by the extension of <lb/>
            their young shoots. Moreover, those trees which are of good <lb/>
            sorts, and which make many shoots, he propagates by extend­ <lb/>
            ing them under the earth in ditches of no very great depth, and <lb/>
            those which do not produce good fruit he endeavours to improve <lb/>
            by the insertion of other kinds into their roots, connecting them <lb/>
            by the most natural union.</p>
          <p>For the same thing happens likewise in the case of men, that <lb/>
            they firmly unite into their own family adopted sons, who are <lb/>
            unconnected with them in blood, but whom they make their <lb/>
            own on account of their virtues. The husbandman, therefore, <lb/>
            takes up innumerable shoots, with their roots entire, which have <lb/>
            by natural process become barren, as far as bearing fruit is <lb/>
            concerned, and which even do great injury to those plants which <lb/>
             <pb n="380"/>
            do bear by reason of their being planted near them. Such, <lb/>
            then, is the art which is applied to those plants which grow out <lb/>
            of the ground. And now let us turn our consideration to the <lb/>
            husbandry of the soul in its turn.</p>
          <p>II. First of all, therefore, the husbandman is not anxious to <lb/>
            plant or to sow anything that is unproductive, but only all such <lb/>
            things as are worth cultivation, and as bear fruit, which will <lb/>
            bring a yearly produce to their master man. For nature has <lb/>
            pointed him out as the master of all trees and animals, and all <lb/>
            other things whatever which are perishable ; and what can man <lb/>
            be but the kind that is in every one of us, which is accustomed <lb/>
            to reap the advantage from all that is sown or planted ? But <lb/>
            since milk is the food of infants, but cakes made of wheat are <lb/>
            the food of fullgrown men, so also the soul must have a milk­ <lb/>
            like nourishment in its age of childhood, namely, the elemen­ <lb/>
            tary instruction of encyclical science. But the perfect food <lb/>
            which is fit for men consists of explanations dictated by pru­ <lb/>
            dence, and temperance, and every virtue.</p>
          <p>For these things being sown and implanted in the mind will <lb/>
            bring forth most advantageous fruit, namely, good and praise­ <lb/>
            worthy actions. By means of this 'husbandry, all the trees <lb/>
            of the passions and vices, which shoot forth and grow up to a <lb/>
            height, bringing forth pernicious fruits, are rooted up, and cut <lb/>
            down, and cleared away, so that not even the smallest frag­ <lb/>
            ment of them is left, from which any new shoots of evil actions <lb/>
            can subsequently spring up. And if, besides, there are any <lb/>
            trees which produce no fruit at all, neither good nor bad, the <lb/>
            husbandman will cut them down too, but still he will not suffer <lb/>
            them to be completely destroyed, but he will apply them to <lb/>
            some appropriate use, making them into stakes and fixing <lb/>
            them as pales all round his homestead, or using them as a <lb/>
            fence for a city to serve instead of a wall.</p>
          <p>III. For Moses says, “ Every tree which bringeth not <lb/>
            forth fruit good to eat thou shalt cut down ; and thou shalt <lb/>
            make it into stakes against the city which shall make war <lb/>
            upon thee.”* And these trees are likened to those powers <lb/>
            developed in words alone, which have nothing in them but <lb/>
            mere speculation, among which we must class medical science, <lb/>
            when unconnected with practice, by which it is natural that <lb/>
            such persons may be cured, and also the oratorical and hireling <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xx. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="381"/>
            species of rhetoric, which is conversant not about the discovery <lb/>
            of the truth, but solely about the means of deceiving the <lb/>
            hearers by plausible persuasion ; and in the same class we <lb/>
            must place all those parts of dialectics and geometry which <lb/>
            have no connection with a proper regulation of the character <lb/>
            or morals, but which only sharpen the mind, not suffering it <lb/>
            to exercise a dull apprehension towards each question which is <lb/>
            raised and submitted to it, but always to dissect the question <lb/>
            and divide it, so as to distinguish the peculiar character of <lb/>
            each thing from the common qualities of the whole genus.</p>
          <p>At all events, men say, that the ancients compared the <lb/>
            principles of philosophy, as being threefold, to a field ; likening <lb/>
            natural philosophy to trees and plants, and moral philosophy <lb/>
            to fruits, for the sake of which the plants are planted ; and <lb/>
            logical philosophy to the hedge or fence : for as the wall, which <lb/>
            is erected around, is the guardian of the plants and of the <lb/>
            fruit which are in the field, keeping off all those who wish to <lb/>
            do them injury and to destroy them, in the same manner, the <lb/>
            logical part of philosophy is the strongest possible sort of <lb/>
            protection to the other two parts, the moral and the natural <lb/>
            philosophy ; for when it simplifies twofold and ambiguous <lb/>
            expressions, and when it solves specious plausibilities entangled <lb/>
            in sophisms, and utterly destroys seductive deceits, the <lb/>
            greatest allurement and ruin to the soul, by means of its own <lb/>
            expressive and clear language, and its unambiguous demon­ <lb/>
            stations, it makes the whole mind smooth like wax, and ready <lb/>
            to receive all the innocent and very praiseworthy impressions <lb/>
            of sound natural and moral philosophy.</p>
          <p>IV. These then are the professions and promises made by <lb/>
            the husbandry of the soul, " I will cut down all the trees of <lb/>
            folly, and intemperance, and injustice, and cowardice; and I <lb/>
            will eradicate all the plants of pleasure, and appetite, and anger, <lb/>
            and passion, and of all similar affections, even if they have <lb/>
            raised their heads as high as heaven. And I will burn out <lb/>
            their roots, darting down the attack of flame to the very founda­ <lb/>
            tions of the earth, so that no portion, nay, no trace, or shadow <lb/>
            whatever, of such things shall be left; and I will destroy these <lb/>
            things, and I will implant in those souls which are of a child­ <lb/>
            like age, young shoots, whose fruit shall nourish them. And <lb/>
            those shoots are as follows: the practice of writing and <lb/>
            reading with facility; an accurate study and investigation of <lb/>
             <pb n="382"/>
            the works of wise poets; geometry, and a careful study of <lb/>
            rhetorical speeches, and the whole course of encyclical edu­ <lb/>
            cation. And in those souls which have arrived at the age of <lb/>
            puberty or. of manhood, I will implant things which are even <lb/>
            better and more perfect, namely, the tree of prudence, the tree <lb/>
            of courage, the tree of temperance, the tree of justice, the tree <lb/>
            of every respective virtue. And if there be any tree belonging <lb/>
            to what is called the wild class, which does not bear eatable <lb/>
            fruit, but which is able to be a fence to and a protector of that <lb/>
            which is eatable, that also I will manage, not for its own sake, <lb/>
            but because it is calculated by nature to be of use to what is <lb/>
            necessary and very useful.</p>
          <p>V. Therefore, the allwise Moses attributes to the just man a <lb/>
            knowledge of the husbandry of the soul, as an act consistent <lb/>
            with his character, and thoroughly suited to him, saying, <lb/>
            " Noah began to be a husbandman." But to the unjust man <lb/>
            he attributes the task of tilling the ground, which is an em­ <lb/>
            ployment bearing the heaviest burdens without any knowledge. <lb/>
            For "Cain," says he, “was a tiller of the ground;" and a <lb/>
            little afterwards, when he is detected in having contracted the <lb/>
            pollution of fratricide, it is said, " Cursed art thou by the <lb/>
            earth, which opened her mouth to receive the word of thy <lb/>
            brother from thy hand, with which thou tillest the earth, and <lb/>
            it shall not put forth its strength to give unto thee." How <lb/>
            then could any one show more manifestly, that the lawgiver <lb/>
            looks upon the wicked man as a tiller of the earth, and not as <lb/>
            a husbandman, than by such language as we here see used ? <lb/>
            We must not indeed suppose that what is here said, is <lb/>
            said of a man who is able to work by his hands or by his feet, <lb/>
            or by any other of the powers of his body, or of any mountain <lb/>
            land, or of any champaign country, but that is applicable to <lb/>
            the powers existing in every one of us; for it happens that the <lb/>
            soul of the wicked man is not concerned about any thing else <lb/>
            except about his earthly body, and about all the pleasures of <lb/>
            that body.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the general crowd of men, travelling over the <lb/>
            different climates of the earth and penetrating to its furthest <lb/>
            boundaries, and traversing the seas, and investigating the <lb/>
            things that lie hid in the recesses of the ocean, and leaving <lb/>
            no single part of the whole universe unexplored, is continually <lb/>
            providing from every quarter the means by which it can in­ <lb/>
             <pb n="383"/>
            crease pleasure. For as fishermen let down their nets at times <lb/>
            to the most extraordinary depths, comprehending a vast surface <lb/>
            of the sea in their circle, in order to catch the greatest possible <lb/>
            number of fish enclosed within their nets, like people shut up <lb/>
            within the walls of a besieged city ; so in the same manner the <lb/>
            greatest part of men having extended their universal nets to <lb/>
            take everything, as the poets somewhere say, not only over the <lb/>
            parts of the sea, but also over the whole nature of earth, and <lb/>
            air, and water, seek to catch everything from every quarter for <lb/>
            the enjoyment and attainment of pleasure. For they dig <lb/>
            mines in the earth, and they sail across the seas, and they <lb/>
            achieve every other work both of peace and war, providing un­ <lb/>
            bounded materials for pleasure, as for their queen, being utterly <lb/>
            uninitiated in that husbandry of the soul which sows and <lb/>
            plants the virtues and reaps their fruit, which is a happy <lb/>
            life.</p>
          <p>But they labouring to procure, and reducing to a system <lb/>
            those things which are pleasant to the flesh, cultivate with all <lb/>
            imaginable care that composite mass, that carefully fashioned <lb/>
            statue, the narrow house of the soul, which, from its birth to <lb/>
            its death it can never lay aside, but which it is compelled to <lb/>
            bear till the day of its death, burdensome as it is.</p>
          <p>VI. We have now therefore explained, in what respect, the <lb/>
            occupation of tilling the ground differs from husbandry, and a <lb/>
            tiller of the ground from a husbandman. And we must now <lb/>
            consider whether there are not some other species akin to <lb/>
            these already mentioned, but which, through the common <lb/>
            names borne by them and others, conceal the real difference <lb/>
            which exists between them. At least there are two which we <lb/>
            have discovered by investigation, concerning which we will say <lb/>
            what is fitting, if it is in our power.</p>
          <p>Therefore, as we found a tiller of the earth and a husband­ <lb/>
            man, though there did not appear to be any difference between <lb/>
            them (till we came to investigate the allegorical meaning con­ <lb/>
            cealed under each name), nevertheless very far removed from <lb/>
            one another in fact, such also shall we find to be the case with <lb/>
            a shepherd and a keeper of sheep. For the lawgiver some­ <lb/>
            times speaks of the occupation of a shepherd, and sometimes <lb/>
            of that of a keeper of sheep. And those who do not examine <lb/>
            expressions with any excessive accuracy, will perhaps fancy <lb/>
            that these two appellations are synonimous terms for the same <lb/>
             <pb n="384"/>
            employment. They are, however, in reality the names of <lb/>
            things which are widely different in the meaning affixed to <lb/>
            their concealed ideas. For if it is customary to give both the <lb/>
            names of shepherd and keeper of sheep to those who have the <lb/>
            management of flocks, still they do not give these names to <lb/>
            that reason which is the superintendant of the flock of the <lb/>
            soul; for a man who is but an indifferent manager of a flock <lb/>
            is called a keeper of sheep, but a good and faithful one is <lb/>
            called a shepherd, and in what way we will proceed to show <lb/>
            immediately.</p>
          <p>VII. Nature has made cattle akin to every individual among <lb/>
            us, the soul putting forth two young branches as from one <lb/>
            root; one of which being entire and undivided, and being left <lb/>
            in its integrity is called the mind; but the other part is sepa­ <lb/>
            rated by six divisions into seven natures, five outward senses, <lb/>
            and two other organs, the organs of speech, and that of gene­ <lb/>
            ration. But all this multitude of external senses and organs <lb/>
            being destitute of reason is compared to a sheep, but since it <lb/>
            is composed of many parts, it of necessity stands in need of a <lb/>
            governor by the unvarying law of nature. Whenever there­ <lb/>
            fore a man who is ignorant how to govern, and at the same <lb/>
            time wealthy, rises up and appoints himself governor, he be­ <lb/>
            comes the cause of innumerable evils to the flocks, for he <lb/>
            supplies all necessary things in superabundance, and the flock <lb/>
            beingimmoderately glutted with them becomes insolent through <lb/>
            the superfluity of food ; for insolence is the genuine offspring <lb/>
            of satiety. Accordingly, they become insolent and exult, and <lb/>
            shake off all restraint, and being scattered in small divisions <lb/>
            they break the appointed order of the Lord. But he who, for <lb/>
            a while, was then governor, being deserted by the flock under <lb/>
            his orders, appears stripped of his authority, and runs about <lb/>
            earnestly endeavouring, if possible, to collect the scattered <lb/>
            flock together and to unite it again; but when he finds that <lb/>
            he is unable to do this he groans and weeps, blaming his own <lb/>
            remissness, and reproaching himself as the cause of all that <lb/>
            has happened.</p>
          <p>In this manner, also, the offspring of the outward senses, <lb/>
            when the mind is supine and indolent, being satiated in the <lb/>
            most unbounded degree with a superfluity of the pleasures of <lb/>
            the outward senses, toss their heads, and frisk about, and rove <lb/>
            about, at random, wherever they please ; the eyes being opened <lb/>
             <pb n="385"/>
            wide to embrace every object of sight, and hastening even to <lb/>
            feast themselves on objects which ought not to be looked at; <lb/>
            and the ears eagerly receiving every kind of voice, and never <lb/>
            being satisfied, but always thirsting for superfluity and the in­ <lb/>
            dulgence of vain curiosity, and sometimes even for such delights <lb/>
            as are but little suited to a free man.</p>
          <p>VIII. Since on what other account can we imagine, that in <lb/>
            every quarter of the habitable globe, the theatres are every day <lb/>
            filled with incalculable myriads of spectators ? For they, being <lb/>
            wholly under the dominion of sounds and sights, and allowing <lb/>
            their ears and their eyes to be carried away without any re­ <lb/>
            straint, go in pursuit of harp-players and singers to the harp, <lb/>
            and every description of effeminate and unmanly music ; and, <lb/>
            moreover, eagerly receiving dancers and every other kind of <lb/>
            actors, because they place themselves and move in all kinds of <lb/>
            effeminate positions and motions, they are continually by their <lb/>
            applause exciting the factions of the theatre, never thinking <lb/>
            either of the propriety of their own conduct or of that of the <lb/>
            general body of the citizens ; but, miserable as they are, up­ <lb/>
            setting all their own plan of life for the sake of their eyes and <lb/>
            ears.</p>
          <p>And there are others who are still more unfortunate and <lb/>
            miserable than these men, who have released their sense of <lb/>
            taste out of prison as it were ; and that sense, immediately <lb/>
            rushing, in an unrestrained manner, to every kind of meat and <lb/>
            drink, selects from the things that are already prepared, and <lb/>
            also cherishes an indiscriminate and insatiable hunger for what <lb/>
            is not present. So that, even if the channels of the belly are <lb/>
            filled, its ever unsatisfied appetites, raging and ravening <lb/>
            around, continue to look and stalk about in every direction, lest <lb/>
            there should any where be any fragment which has been over­ <lb/>
            looked, that it may swallow that up also like a devouring fire. <lb/>
            And this gluttony is followed by its usual natural attendant, an <lb/>
            eagerness for the connections of the sexes, which brings in its <lb/>
            train a strange frenzy, an unrestrainable madness and a most <lb/>
            grievous fury; for, when men are oppressed by the indulgence <lb/>
            of gluttony and delicate food, and by much unmixed wine and <lb/>
            drunkenness, they are no longer able to restrain themselves, <lb/>
            but hastening to amorous gratifications they revel and disturb <lb/>
            the doors, until they are at last able to rest when they have <lb/>
            drawn off the great violence of their passion. On which account <note type="footnote"> c c </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="386"/>
            nature, as it would seem, has placed the organs of such connec­ <lb/>
            tion beneath the belly, being previously aware that they do not <lb/>
            delight in hunger, but that they follow upon satiety and then <lb/>
            rise up to fulfil their peculiar operations.</p>
          <p>IX. Those, then, who permit the flock committed to their <lb/>
            charge to satiate themselves all at once with all the things <lb/>
            that they desire, we must call keepers of sheep; but those, on <lb/>
            the contrary, we should entitle shepherds, who supply their <lb/>
            flocks with only so much as is necessary and proper for them; <lb/>
            cutting off and utterly rejecting all superfluous and useless ex­ <lb/>
            travagance and abundance, which is not less injurious than <lb/>
            want and deficiency, and who guard with great prudence against <lb/>
            the possibility of the flock becoming diseased through their <lb/>
            want of care and indolence, praying that those diseases, which <lb/>
            at times are liable to attack flocks from external causes, may <lb/>
            not visit theirs. And they take equal care that it may not <lb/>
            straggle about at random and get scattered, holding out to them <lb/>
            as an object of fear one who will chastise those who never obey <lb/>
            reason, and inflicting continual punishment, moderate when <lb/>
            applied to those who err only in such a degree as admits of a <lb/>
            remedy, but very severe when laid upon those whose wicked­ <lb/>
            ness is uncurable; for though in its essence it may appear an <lb/>
            abominable thing, nevertheless punishment is the greatest good <lb/>
            to foolish persons, great as the remedies of the physician are to <lb/>
            those who are ill in the body.</p>
          <p>X. These, then, are the occupations of shepherds who prefer <lb/>
            those things which are useful, though mixed with unpleasant­ <lb/>
            ness, to those which are pleasant but pernicious. Thus, at all <lb/>
            events, the occupation of a shepherd has come to be considered a <lb/>
            respectable and profitable employment, so that the race of poets <lb/>
            has been accustomed to call kings the shepherds of the people ; <lb/>
            but the law giver gives this title to the wise, who are the only <lb/>
            real kings, for he represents them as rulers of all men of irra­ <lb/>
            tional passions, as of a flock of sheep. On this account he has <lb/>
            attributed to Jacob, the man who was made perfect by practice, <lb/>
            a skill in the science of a shepherd, saying: " For he is the <lb/>
            shepherd of Laban's sheep." * That is, of the sheep of the <lb/>
            foolish soul, which thinks only those things good which are the <lb/>
            objects of the outward senses and apparent to them, being <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxx. 36. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="387"/>
            deceived and enslaved by colours and shadows; for the name <lb/>
            Laban, being interpreted, means "whitening."</p>
          <p>He also attributes the same skill to the all-wise Moses,* for <lb/>
            he also is represented as the shepherd of the mind which em­ <lb/>
            braces pride in preference to truth, and which receives appear­ <lb/>
            ance rather than reality; for the interpretation of the name <lb/>
            Jethro is " superfluous," and superfluity is pride adopted for <lb/>
            the purpose of introducing error into correct life ; which is the <lb/>
            cause why different things are looked upon as right in different <lb/>
            cities, and not those principles which ought to be looked upon <lb/>
            as just everywhere, inasmuch as it never sees, not even in a <lb/>
            dream, the common and immovable principles of the justice of <lb/>
            nature. For, it is said, that " Moses was the shepherd of the <lb/>
            sheep of Jethro, the priest of Midian.” And this man himself <lb/>
            prays that the flock may not be left without a shepherd, mean­ <lb/>
            ing by the flock the whole multitude of the parts of the soul; <lb/>
            but that they may meet with a good shepherd, who will lead <lb/>
            them away from the nets of folly, and injustice, and all wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, and conduct them to the doctrines of learning and all <lb/>
            other virtue; for, says Moses, " Let the Lord the God of <lb/>
            spirits and of all flesh look down upon man and upon this <lb/>
            assembly."t And then, a little further on, he adds, " And <lb/>
            the assembly of the Lord shall not be like sheep who have no <lb/>
            shepherd."</p>
          <p>XI. But is it not well worth praying for, that the flock <lb/>
            which is akin to each individual of us, and of so much value, <lb/>
            may not be left without any superintendent or governor, so <lb/>
            that we may not, through being filled with a love of the worst <lb/>
            of all constitutions, an ochlocracy, which is a base copy of the <lb/>
            best form, democracy, pass our lives for ever amid tumults, and <lb/>
            disorders, and intestine seditions ? Certainly it is not anarchy <lb/>
            alone that is an evil, through being the parent of ochlocracy, <lb/>
            but also the insurrection of any lawless and violent force against <lb/>
            authority; for the tyrant who, by his own nature is hostile, is, <lb/>
            in the case of cities, a man, but in the case of the body and the <lb/>
            soul, and all transactions having reference to either, he is a mind <lb/>
            resembling the brute beasts, besieging the citadel of each in­ <lb/>
            dividual ; but not only are these dominations unprofitable, but <lb/>
            so also are the governments and authority of other persons, <lb/>
            who are very gentle, for gentleness is a line of conduct very <note type="footnote"> * Exodus iii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxvii. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> c c 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="388"/>
            likely to be despised, and injurious to both parties, both to the <lb/>
            rulers and the subjects. To the one from the disregard with <lb/>
            which their subjects treat them, so that they are unable to <lb/>
            manage any matter, whether of public or of their own private <lb/>
            business successfully, are sometimes even compelled to abdi­ <lb/>
            cate their authority; and to the others, because of their con­ <lb/>
            tinual disrespect to their governors, disregarding all persuasion, <lb/>
            so that they contract a habit of self-willed insolence, a pos­ <lb/>
            session of great evil. We must then think that one of these <lb/>
            classes of governors differs in no respect from keepers of sheep, <lb/>
            while the others resemble the sheep themselves, for the go­ <lb/>
            vernors persuade the governed to be luxurious, through the <lb/>
            extravagance of the supplies with which they provide them; <lb/>
            and the governed being unable to bear their satiety become <lb/>
            insolent; but what is really desirable is, that our mind should <lb/>
            govern all our conduct, like a goatherd, or a cowherd, or a <lb/>
            shepherd, or, in short, like any herdsman of any kind; <lb/>
            choosing in preference to what is pleasant that which is for <lb/>
            the advantage both of himself and of his flock.</p>
          <p>XII. But the providence of God is the principal and almost <lb/>
            the only cause that the divisions of the soul are not left <lb/>
            entirely without any governor, and that they have met with a <lb/>
            blameless and in all respects good shepherd. In consequence <lb/>
            of whose appointment it is impossible that the company of the <lb/>
            mind should become scattered ; for it will of necessity appear <lb/>
            in one and the same order, looking to the authority of its one <lb/>
            governor, since the heaviest burden of all is to be compelled <lb/>
            to obey a variety of rulers. Thus, indeed, being a shepherd is <lb/>
            a good thing, so that it is justly attributed, not only to kings, <lb/>
            and to wise men, and to souls who are perfectly purified, but <lb/>
            also to God, the ruler of all things ; and he who confirms this <lb/>
            is not any ordinary person, but a prophet, whom it is good to <lb/>
            believe, he namely who wrote the psalms; for he speaks thus, <lb/>
            "The Lord is my shepherd, and he shall cause me to lack <lb/>
            nothing and let every one in his turn say the same thing, <lb/>
            for it is very becoming to every man who loves God to study <lb/>
            such a song as this, but above all this world should sing it.</p>
          <p>For God, like a shepherd and a king, governs (as if they <lb/>
            were a flock of sheep) the earth, and the water, and the air, <lb/>
            and the fire, and all the plants, and living creatures that are in <note type="footnote"> * Psalm xxiii. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="389"/>
            them, whether mortal or divine; and lie regulates the nature <lb/>
            of the heaven, and the periodical revolutions of the sun and <lb/>
            moon, and the variations and harmonious movements of the <lb/>
            other stars, ruling them according to law and justice ; ap­ <lb/>
            pointing, as their immediate superintendent, his own right <lb/>
            reason, his first-born son, who is to receive the charge of <lb/>
            this sacred. company, as the lieutenant of the great king; for <lb/>
            it is said somewhere, "Behold, I am he! I will send my mes­ <lb/>
            senger before thy face, who shall keep thee in the road.”* <lb/>
            Let therefore all the world, the greatest and most perfect <lb/>
            flock of the living God, say, " The Lord is my shepherd, and <lb/>
            he shall cause me to lack nothing," and let every separate <lb/>
            individual say the same thing; not with the voice which <lb/>
            proceeds from his tongue and his mouth, extending only <lb/>
            through a scanty portion of the air, but with the wide spreading <lb/>
            voice of the mind, which reaches to the very extremities of <lb/>
            this universe; for it is impossible that there should be a <lb/>
            deficiency of anything that is necessary, where God presides, <lb/>
            who is in the habit of bestowing good things in all fulness and <lb/>
            completeness in all living beings.</p>
          <p>XIII. But there is a very beautiful encouragement to <lb/>
            equality contained in the song before mentioned; for in real <lb/>
            truth, the man who appears to have everything else, and yet <lb/>
            who is impatient under the authority of one master, is in­ <lb/>
            complete in his happiness, and is poor ; but if a soul is governed <lb/>
            by God, having that one and only thing on which all other <lb/>
            things depend, it is very naturally in no need of other <lb/>
            things, regarding not blind riches, but only such as are <lb/>
            endowed with real and acute sight, f All true disciples <lb/>
            have come to conceive an earnest and unalterable love for that; <lb/>
            and therefore laughing at the mere keeping of sheep, they <lb/>
            have directed their attention to the attainment of a shepherd's <lb/>
            knowledge; and a proof of this is to be found in the case of <lb/>
            Joseph, who was always studying that knowledge which is <lb/>
            conversant about the body and vain opinions, not being able to <lb/>
            rule and govern irrational nature (for it is customary for old <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxiii. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> t I have again followed Mangey. The text has ov <foreign xml:lang="grc">τυφλὸν πλου̃τον <lb/>

            men to be appointed to offices of irresponsible authority; but <lb/>
            this man is always young, even if after a lapse of time he <lb/>
            may come to support old age, which has at last reached him); <lb/>
            and being accustomed to nourish this and to lead it on to <lb/>
            growth, he expects to be able to persuade the lovers of virtue <lb/>
            to change and come over to him, in order, that in so changing <lb/>
            to irrational and inanimate objects, they may have no leisure <lb/>
            for applying themselves to the studies of a rational soul.</p>
          <p>For Moses represents Joseph as saying, " If the king," that <lb/>
            is to say, the mind, the king of the body, “ shall ask you, <lb/>
            What is your occupation ? answer, We are men, the keepers of <lb/>
            cattle.”* When they hear this they are naturally impatient, <lb/>
            not liking the idea, while they are rulers, of confessing that <lb/>
            they hold the rank of subordinates; for those who supply food <lb/>
            to the outward senses, through the abundance of the objects <lb/>
            perceptible only by them, become the slaves of those who are <lb/>
            nourished, like servants who pay to their mistresses a com­ <lb/>
            pulsory reverence every day; but those who preside over them <lb/>
            are rulers, and they bridle the vehement impetuosity with <lb/>
            which they are hurried on to luxury.</p>
          <p>At first therefore, although they do not hear what is said <lb/>
            with any pleasure, they will still keep silence, thinking it <lb/>
            unseemly to discuss the difference between the employment of <lb/>
            a keeper of cattle and a shepherd, before those who do not <lb/>
            understand it; but subsequently, when a contest about these <lb/>
            things arises, they will contend with all their power, and <lb/>
            will never desist till they have carried their point by main force, <lb/>
            having exhibited the liberality, and nobleness, and royal <lb/>
            character of their nature to the living God. Accordingly when <lb/>
            the king asks, " What is your occupation ?" they will answer <lb/>
            " We are shepherds, we and our fathers.</p>
          <p>XIV. Would they not then appear to boast as much of <lb/>
            their occupation as shepherds, as the king himself, who is <lb/>
            conversing with them, does of his mighty power and domin­ <lb/>
            ion? At least they are testifying their high opinion of the <lb/>
            profession of life which they have adopted, not in honour of <lb/>
            themselves alone, but of their father also, as being worthy of <lb/>
            all possible care and diligence; and yet, if the discussion had <lb/>
            been merely about the care of goats or sheep, perhaps they <lb/>
            would have been ashamed to make such an admission through <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlvi. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="391"/>
            desire to avoid dishonour; for such occupations are accounted <lb/>
            inglorious and mean among those who are loaded with great <lb/>
            prosperity, without being at the same time endowed with <lb/>
            prudence, and especially among kings. And the Egyptian <lb/>
            character is by nature most especially haughty and boastful <lb/>
            whenever so slight a breeze of prosperity does merely blow <lb/>
            upon it, so that men of that nation look upon the pursuits <lb/>
            of life and objects of ambition of ordinary men, as subjects for <lb/>
            laughter and downright ridicule.</p>
          <p>But since the matter before us, at present, is to consider the <lb/>
            rational and irrational powers in the soul, those persons will <lb/>
            naturally boast, who are persuaded that they are able to master <lb/>
            the irrational faculties, by taking the rational ones for their <lb/>
            allies. If therefore any envious or captious person should <lb/>
            blame us, and say, " How then have ye, who are devoted to <lb/>
            the employment of shepherds, and who profess to be occupied <lb/>
            in the care and management of the flocks which belong to you, <lb/>
            ever thought of approaching the country of the body and the <lb/>
            passions, namely Egypt ? and why have ye not turned your <lb/>
            voyage in another direction? You must say to him in reply, <lb/>
            with all freedom of speech, We have come hither as sojourn­ <lb/>
            ers, not as inhabitants." For in reality every soul of a wise <lb/>
            man has heaven for its country, and looks upon earth as a <lb/>
            strange land, and considers the house of wisdom his own home; <lb/>
            but the house of the body, a lodging-house, on which it pro­ <lb/>
            poses to sojourn for a while. Therefore since the mind, the <lb/>
            ruler of the flock, having taken the flock of the soul, using the <lb/>
            law of nature as its teacher, governs it consistently and <lb/>
            vigorously, rendering it worthy of approbation and great praise; <lb/>
            but when it manages it sluggishly and indulgently, with a <lb/>
            disregard of law, then it renders it blameable. Very naturally, <lb/>
            therefore, the one will assume the name of a lung, being <lb/>
            addressed as a shepherd, but the other will only have the title <lb/>
            of a confectioner, or of a baker, being called a keeper of sheep, <lb/>
            supplying the means of feasting and gluttonous eating to cattle <lb/>
            accustomed to gorge themselves to satiety.</p>
          <p>XV. I have now therefore explained, in no superficial manner, <lb/>
            in what way a husbandman differs from a tiller of the ground, <lb/>
            and a shepherd from a keeper of sheep. There is also a third <lb/>
            point, having some connection with what has already been <lb/>
            said, which we will now proceed to speak of. For I consider <lb/>
             <pb n="392"/>
            that a horseman and a rider differ; meaning by this state­ <lb/>
            ment, not merely that one man who is carried on a neighing <lb/>
            animal differs from another mail who is carried on a similar <lb/>
            beast, but the motion of the one is different from the motion of <lb/>
            the other; therefore the man who gets on a horse without any <lb/>
            skill in horsemanship, is correctly called a rider, and he has <lb/>
            given himself up to an irrational and restive animal, to such a <lb/>
            degree that it is absolutely inevitable that he must be carried <lb/>
            wherever the animal chooses to go, and if he fails to see <lb/>
            beforehand a chasm in the earth, or a deep pit, it has hap­ <lb/>
            pened before now that such a man, in consequence of the <lb/>
            impetuosity of his course, has been thrown headlong down a <lb/>
            precipice and dashed to pieces. But a horseman, on the other <lb/>
            hand, when he is about to mount, takes the bridle in his hand, <lb/>
            and then taking hold of the mane on the horse's neck, he leaps <lb/>
            on ; and though he appears to be carried by the horse, yet, if <lb/>
            one must tell the truth, he in reality guides the animal that <lb/>
            carries him, as a pilot guides a ship. For the pilot too, ap­ <lb/>
            pearing to be carried by the ship which he is managing, does in <lb/>
            real truth guide it, and conducts it to whatever harbour he is <lb/>
            himself desirous to hasten. While, therefore, the horse goes <lb/>
            on in obedience to the rein, the horseman pats the horse, as if <lb/>
            praising it; but when it goes on with too great impetuosity, <lb/>
            and is carried away beyond moderation, then he pulls it back <lb/>
            with force and vigour, so as to restrain its speed. But if the <lb/>
            horse continue to be disobedient, then he takes the whole <lb/>
            bridle, and pulls him back, and drags back his neck, so that <lb/>
            he is compelled to stop. And for all his restiveness and his <lb/>
            continued disregard of the rein, there are whips and spurs pre­ <lb/>
            pared, and all other instruments of punishment which have <lb/>
            been invented by horse-breakers. And it is not wonderful : <lb/>
            for when the horseman mounts, the art of horsemanship <lb/>
            mounts too ; so that there then being two parties borne by the <lb/>
            horse, and skilful in horsemanship, they will very naturally <lb/>
            get the better of one animal who is subjected to them, and who <lb/>
            is incapable of acquiring skill.</p>
          <p>XVI. Therefore now, leaving the consideration of these <lb/>
            neighing animals, and of the parties carried by them, investi­ <lb/>
            gate, if you will, the condition of your own soul. For in its <lb/>
            several parts you will find both horses and a rider in the <lb/>
            fashion of a charioteer, just as you do in external things.</p><pb n="393"/>
            
          <p>Now, the horses are appetite and passion,' the one being male <lb/>
            and the other female. On this account, the one giving itself <lb/>
            airs, wishes to be unrestrained and free, and holds its head <lb/>
            erect, as a male animal naturally does; and the other, not <lb/>
            being free, but of a slavish disposition, and rejoicing in all <lb/>
            kinds of crafty wickedness, devours the house, and destroys the <lb/>
            house, for she is female. And the rider and charioteer is one, <lb/>
            namely the mind. When, indeed, he mounts with prudence, <lb/>
            he is a charioteer ; but when he does so with folly, then he is <lb/>
            but a rider. For a fool, through ignorance, is unable to keep <lb/>
            hold of the reins ; but they, falling from his bands, drop on the <lb/>
            ground. And the animals, immediately that they have got the <lb/>
            better of the reins, run on in an ill-regulated and unrestrained <lb/>
            course. But the man who has mounted behind them, not <lb/>
            being able to take hold of anything by which he may steady <lb/>
            himself, falls, and lacerating his knees and his hands and his <lb/>
            face, like a miserable man as he is, he bitterly weeps over his <lb/>
            disaster; and after hanging by his feet to the chariot after <lb/>
            he has been overturned, he is suspended, with his face upwards, <lb/>
            lying on his back; and as the chariot proceeds, he is dragged <lb/>
            along, and injured in his head, and neck, and both his shoulders ; <lb/>
            and then, being hurried on in this direction and in that, and <lb/>
            being dashed against everything which lies in the way, he en­ <lb/>
            dures a most pitiable death.</p>
          <p>He then meets with an end, such as I have been describing ; <lb/>
            and the chariot, being lightened by his fall and bounding <lb/>
            along violently, when, at last, it is dashed to the ground in the <lb/>
            rebound, is easily broken to pieces, so that it can never again <lb/>
            be joined or fastened together. And the animals, being now <lb/>
            released from everything which could restrain them, proceed at <lb/>
            random, and are frantic, and do not cease galloping on, till <lb/>
            they are tripped up and fall, or till they are hurried over some <lb/>
            high precipice, and so are dashed to pieces and destroyed.</p>
          <p>XVII. In this manner, then, it seems that the whole <lb/>
            chariot of the soul is destroyed, with its passengers ; and all <lb/>
            through the carelessness or unskilfulness of the driver. But it <lb/>
            is desirable for them that such horses, and such drivers, and <lb/>
            riders, so wholly without skill, should be destroyed, in order <lb/>
            that the faculties of virtue may be roused ; for when folly has <lb/>
            fallen, it follows of necessity that wisdom must rise up. On <lb/>
            this account Moses, in his passages of exhortation, says, “ If <lb/>
             <pb n="394"/>
            thou gocst forth to battle against thy enemies, and if thou <lb/>
            seest numbers of horses, and riders, and people, be not afraid, <lb/>
            because the Lord thy God is with thee."* For we must <lb/>
            neglect anger and desire, and, in short, all the passions, and <lb/>
            indeed the whole company of reasonings, which are mounted <lb/>
            upon each of the passions as upon horses, even if they believe <lb/>
            that they can exert irresistible strength ; at least, all those <lb/>
            must do so who have the power of the great King holding a <lb/>
            shield over them, and in every place, and at every time, fight­ <lb/>
            ing in their defence. But the divine army is the body of <lb/>
            virtues, the champions of the souls that love God, whom it <lb/>
            becomes, when they see the adversary defeated, to sing a most <lb/>
            beautiful and becoming hymn to the God who giveth the vic­ <lb/>
            tory and the glorious triumph; and two choruses, the one <lb/>
            proceeding from the conclave of the men, and the other from <lb/>
            the company of the women, will stand up and sing in alternate <lb/>
            songs a melody responsive to one another's voices.</p>
          <p>And the chorus of men will have Moses for their leader; <lb/>
            and that of the women will be under the guidance of Miriam, <lb/>
            " the purified outward sense." t For it is just that hymns <lb/>
            and praises should be uttered in honour of God without any <lb/>
            delay, both in accordance with the suggestions of the intellect <lb/>
            and the perceptions of the outward senses, and that each in­ <lb/>
            strument should be struck in harmony, I mean those both of <lb/>
            the mind and of the outward sense, in gratitude and honour to <lb/>
            the holy Saviour. Accordingly, all the men sing the song on <lb/>
            the sea-shore, not indeed with a blind mind, but seeing sharply, <lb/>
            Moses being the leader of the song ; and women sing, who <lb/>
            are in good truth the most excellent of their sex, having been <lb/>
            enrolled in the lists of the republic of virtue, Miriam being <lb/>
            their leader.</p>
          <p>XVIII. And the same hymn is sung by both the choruses, <lb/>
            having a most admirable burden of the song which is beautiful <lb/>
            to be sung. And it is as follows: “ Let us sing unto the <lb/>
            Lord, for he has been glorified gloriously; the horse and his <lb/>
            rider hath he thrown into the sea.”‡ For no one, if he searches <lb/>
            ever so eagerly, can ever discover a more excellent victory than <lb/>
            that by which the most mighty army, four-footed, restive, and <lb/>
            proud as it was, of the passions and vices was overthrown. <lb/>
            For the vices are four in genus, and the passions likewise are <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xx. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xv. 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="395"/>
            equal in number. Moreover, the mind, which is the character <lb/>
            of them all, the one which hates virtue and loves the passions, <lb/>
            has fallen and perished-the mind, which delighted in pleasures <lb/>
            and appetites, and deeds of injustice and wickedness, and <lb/>
            likewise in acts of rapine and of covetousness.</p>
          <p>Very beautifully, therefore, does the lawgiver in his recom­ <lb/>
            mendations, teach us not to elect as a chief, a man who is a <lb/>
            breeder of horses, thinking that such a one is altogether <lb/>
            unsuited to exercise authority, inasmuch as he is in a frenzy <lb/>
            about pleasures and appetites, and intolerable loves, and rages <lb/>
            about like an unbridled and unmanageable horse. For he <lb/>
            speaks thus, " Thou shalt not be able to set over thyself a <lb/>
            mail that is a stranger, because he is not thy brother ; because <lb/>
            he will not multiply for himself his horses, and will not turn <lb/>
            his people towards Egypt." * Therefore, according to the <lb/>
            most holy Moses, no man that was a breeder of horses was <lb/>
            ever born fit for dominion; and yet some one perhaps may <lb/>
            say that power in cavalry is a great strength to the king, not <lb/>
            inferior either to infantry or to a naval force, but in many <lb/>
            places far more advantageous than either, and especially in <lb/>
            those cases in which one has need of swiftness of motion with­ <lb/>
            out delay, but prompt and energetic, when the times do not <lb/>
            admit of delay, but are at the very crisis of action, so that <lb/>
            those who arrive too late are very naturally not considered to <lb/>
            have been sluggish so much as to have been wholly useless, <lb/>
            the opportunity for action having passed by like a cloud.</p>
          <p>XIX. And we would say to these people: My good men, <lb/>
            the lawgiver is removing no protection whatever from the ruler, <lb/>
            nor is he in any respect mutilating the army of his power <lb/>
            which he has collected, by cutting off the force of cavalry <lb/>
            which is the most efficient part of his army; but he is <lb/>
            endeavouring to the best of his power to increase and <lb/>
            strengthen it, in order that his allies, contributing to its <lb/>
            strength and number, may most easily destroy their enemies. <lb/>
            For who else is equally skilful in marshalling and arraying <lb/>
            armies, and in distributing them in squadrons, and in appoint­ <lb/>
            ing captains of regiments and leaders of squadrons, and other <lb/>
            commanders of large and small bodies, and in displaying a <lb/>
            knowledge of all the other suggestions of tactics and strategy, <note type="footnote"> It Deuteronomy xvii. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="396"/>
            and in explaining the principles of the military art to those <lb/>
            who will avail themselves of them skilfully, through the great <lb/>
            superabundance of his knowledge of such matters ? But the <lb/>
            question is not now about his force of cavalry, which it is <lb/>
            necessary to collect around the rulers for the destruction of <lb/>
            their enemies and the protection of their friends; but con­ <lb/>
            cerning the irrational, and immoderate, and unmanageable im­ <lb/>
            petuosity of the soul, which it is desirable to check, lest it <lb/>
            should turn all its people towards Egypt, the country of the <lb/>
            body, and labour with all its might to render it devoted to <lb/>
            pleasure and to the passions, rather than to the service of <lb/>
            virtue and of God; since it follows inevitably that he who has <lb/>
            acquired a body of cavalry for himself, must, as he said him­ <lb/>
            self, proceed on the road which leads to Egypt.</p>
          <p>For when the wave rises high and dashes over each side of <lb/>
            the soul (looking upon it as a ship), that is to say, over the <lb/>
            mind and the outward sense, being lifted up by evident pas­ <lb/>
            sions and iniquities which blow fiercely upon it, so that the <lb/>
            soul leans on one side and is nearly over-balanced; then, as <lb/>
            is natural, the mind becoming water-logged, goes down, and <lb/>
            the deep in which it is sunk and overwhelmed is the body, <lb/>
            which is compared to Egypt.</p>
          <p>XX. Beware, therefore, never to occupy yourself in this <lb/>
            kind of horse-breeding, for they who pursue the other kind are <lb/>
            themselves also blameable, for how can they not be ? inasmuch <lb/>
            as by them irrational animals are exceedingly humoured, and <lb/>
            from their houses troops of well-fed horses continually go forth; <lb/>
            while to the men who conduct them, not a person is found <lb/>
            who ever gives the slightest contribution to relieve their wants, <lb/>
            nor any present to increase their superfluities. But, never­ <lb/>
            theless, they err in a lighter degree; for these men who breed <lb/>
            horses to contend for the prize, assert that by so doing they <lb/>
            are adorning the sacred games and the assemblies, which are <lb/>
            held in honour everywhere, and they affirm that they are the <lb/>
            causes not only of pleasure to the spectators, and of that kind <lb/>
            of delight which arises from beholding the spectacle, but that <lb/>
            they also give them an inducement to study and practise <lb/>
            praiseworthy pursuits. For they who attribute to animals a <lb/>
            desire for victory, using, out of their love of honour and rivalry <lb/>
            in excellence, a certain unceasing exhortation, and encourage­ <lb/>
            ment, and eagerness, enduring pleasant labours, will never <lb/>
             <pb n="397"/>
            desist from what is suitable and becoming to them, till they <lb/>
            attain the end that they desire.</p>
          <p>But these men seek pretexts to excuse themselves, while <lb/>
            doing wrong, but those who do wrong without excuse are they, <lb/>
            who would make the mind a rider, and mount him upon his <lb/>
            horse, though ignorant of the science of horsemanship, his <lb/>
            horse being that four-footed vice and passion ; but if after <lb/>
            having been taught the art of managing a chariot, you devote <lb/>
            greater pains and study to it, and think yourself at last com­ <lb/>
            petent and able to manage horses, mount, and take hold of the <lb/>
            reins. For thus, even if they are restive, you will not, by being <lb/>
            thrown out of the chariot, receive wounds difficult to be cured, <lb/>
            and also afford a subject of ridicule to all the spectators who <lb/>
            delight in mischief; nor, on the other hand, will you be over­ <lb/>
            whelmed by your enemies coming against you or running over <lb/>
            you from behind, since by your own speed you will outstrip and <lb/>
            leave behind those who are coming after you, and you will be <lb/>
            able to afford to disregard those who are coming towards you, <lb/>
            because of your skill in getting safely out of the way.</p>
          <p>XXI. It is not unnaturally, therefore, that Moses, singing <lb/>
            his song of triumph on the destruction of the riders, neverthe­ <lb/>
            less prays for complete safety for the horsemen; for these are <lb/>
            able, putting their bridles into the mouths of the irrational <lb/>
            powers, to check the impetuosity of their superabundant vio­ <lb/>
            lence. What then his prayer is must be told: he says, " Let <lb/>
            Dan be a serpent in the way, sitting in the path, biting the <lb/>
            heel of the horse; and the horseman shall fall backwards, <lb/>
            awaiting the salvation of the Lord."* But we must explain <lb/>
            what is the enigmatical meaning which he conceals under this <lb/>
            prayer, the name of Dan, being interpreted, means "judg­ <lb/>
            ment therefore he here likens that power of the soul which <lb/>
            investigates, and accurately examines, and distinguishes be­ <lb/>
            tween, and, in some degree, decides on each part of the soul, <lb/>
            to a dragon (and the dragon is an animal various in its move­ <lb/>
            ments, and exceedingly cunning, and ready to display its <lb/>
            courage, and very powerful to repel those who begin acts of <lb/>
            violence), but not to that friendly serpent, the counsellor of <lb/>
            life, which is wont to he called Eve in his national language, <lb/>
            but to the one made by Moses, of the material of brass, which, <lb/>
            when those who had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. IT. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="398"/>
            and who were at the point of death beheld, they are said to <lb/>
            have lived and not to have died.</p>
          <p>XXII. And these things thus expressed resemble visions <lb/>
            and prodigies; I mean the account of one dragon uttering the <lb/>
            voice of a man and pouring his sophistries into most innocent <lb/>
            dispositions, and deceiving the woman with plausible arguments <lb/>
            of persuasion; and of another becoming a cause of complete <lb/>
            safety to those who looked upon it. But, in the allegorical <lb/>
            explanations of these statements, all that bears a fabulous ap­ <lb/>
            pearance is got rid of in a moment, and the truth is discovered <lb/>
            in a most evident manner.</p>
          <p>The serpent, then, which appeared to the woman, that is to <lb/>
            life depending on the outward senses and on the flesh, we pro­ <lb/>
            nounce to have been pleasure, crawling forward with an indirect <lb/>
            motion, full of innumerable wiles, unable to raise itself up, ever <lb/>
            cast down on the ground, creeping only upon the good things <lb/>
            of the earth, seeking lurking places in the body, burying itself <lb/>
            in each of the outward senses as in pits or caverns, a plotter <lb/>
            against man, designing destruction to a being better than <lb/>
            itself, eager to kill with its poisonous but painless bite. But <lb/>
            the brazen serpent, made by Moses, we explain as being the <lb/>
            disposition opposite to pleasure, namely, patient endurance, on <lb/>
            which account it is that he is represented as having made it of <lb/>
            brass, which is a very strong material. He, then, who with <lb/>
            sound judgment contemplates the appearance of patient en­ <lb/>
            durance, even if he has been previously bitten by the allure­ <lb/>
            ments of pleasure, must inevitably live ; for the one holds over <lb/>
            his soul a death to be averted by no prayers, but self-restraint <lb/>
            proffers him health and preservation of life ; and temperance, <lb/>
            which repels evils, is a remedy and perfect antidote for intem­ <lb/>
            perance. And every wise man looks upon what is good as dear <lb/>
            to him, which is also altogether calculated to ensure his pre­ <lb/>
            servation.</p>
          <p>So that when Moses prays that it may happen to Dan, either <lb/>
            himself, to be that serpent (for the words may be understood <lb/>
            in either sense), he means a serpent closely resembling the <lb/>
            one which has been made by himself, but not like the one <lb/>
            which appeared to Eve, for then the prayer is an entreaty for <lb/>
            good things; therefore the character of patient endurance is <lb/>
            good, and capable of receiving immortality, which is the perfect <lb/>
            good. But the character of pleasure is evil, bringing in its <lb/>
             <pb n="399"/>
            train the greatest of all punishments, death. On which account <lb/>
            Moses says, "Let Dan become a serpent," and that not in any <lb/>
            other place rather than in the road. For the indulgences of <lb/>
            intemperance and gluttony, and whatever other vices the im­ <lb/>
            moderate and insatiable pleasures, when completely filled with <lb/>
            an abundance of all external things, produce and bring forth, <lb/>
            do not allow the soul to proceed onwards by the plain and <lb/>
            straight road, but compel it to fall into ravines and gulfs, until <lb/>
            they utterly destroy it; but those practices which adhere to <lb/>
            patience, and endurance, and moderation, and all other virtues, <lb/>
            keep the soul in the straight road, leaving no stumbling block <lb/>
            in the way, against which it can stumble and fall. Very na­ <lb/>
            turally, therefore, has Moses declared that temperance clings <lb/>
            to the right way, because it is plain that the contrary habit, in­ <lb/>
            temperance, is always straying from the road.:</p>
          <p>XXIII. And the expression, “ Sitting in the path," sug­ <lb/>
            gests some such meaning as this, as I persuade myself: a <lb/>
            path is a road calculated for riding horses and driving car­ <lb/>
            riages on, well beaten by men and beasts. This road they say <lb/>
            is very like pleasure, for almost from their earliest birth to <lb/>
            extreme old age men proceed and walk along it, and with <lb/>
            great indolence and easiness of temper spend all their lives in <lb/>
            it, and not men only, but every species of animal whatever; <lb/>
            for there is no single thing which is not attracted by the <lb/>
            allurements of pleasure, and which is not, at times, entangled <lb/>
            in its multifarious nets, from which it is very difficult to <lb/>
            escape. But the paths of prudence, and temperance, and the <lb/>
            other virtues, even though they may not be utterly untra­ <lb/>
            velled, are, at all events, not beaten much; for the number of <lb/>
            those who proceed by those roads, and who philosophise in a <lb/>
            genuine spirit, and who form associations with virtue alone, <lb/>
            disregarding, once for all, all other allurements, is very small. <lb/>
            Therefore he sits constantly in the road, and not once only, <lb/>
            who has an eagerness for, and a care for, patient endurances, <lb/>
            in order to watch from his ambush and attack pleasure, to <lb/>
            which men in general are accustomed, that fountain of ever­ <lb/>
            lasting evils, and so to keep it off, and to eradicate it from the <lb/>
            whole district of the soul. Then, as Moses says, proceeding <lb/>
            to the natural consequence of his position, he will of necessity <lb/>
            bite the heel of the horse; for it is the especial attribute of <lb/>
            patient endurance and temperance to shake and overturn the <lb/>
             <pb n="400"/>
            foundations of vice, which lifts its head on high, and of exerted, <lb/>
            and quickly-moved, and unmanageable passion.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Moses, therefore, represents the serpent that ap­ <lb/>
            peared to Eve as planning the death of man, for he records, <lb/>
            that God says in his curses, " He shall bruise thy head, and <lb/>
            thou shalt bruise his heel." But he represents the serpent of <lb/>
            Dan, which is the one which we are now discussing, as biting <lb/>
            the heel of the horse and not of the man, for the serpent of <lb/>
            Eve, being the symbol of pleasure, as has been already shown, <lb/>
            attacks man, that is to say, the reasoning power which is in <lb/>
            every one of us; for the enjoyment and free use of excessive <lb/>
            pleasure is the destruction of the mind; and the serpent of <lb/>
            Dan being a sort of image of vigorous virtue and of patient <lb/>
            endurance, will bite the horse, who is the emblem of passion <lb/>
            and wickedness, because temperance is occupied about the <lb/>
            overthrow and destruction of these things. Accordingly, when <lb/>
            they are bitten and when they have fallen, " the horseman <lb/>
            also," says Moses, " will fall;" and the meaning which he con­ <lb/>
            ceals under this enigmatical expression is such as this, that <lb/>
            we must think it an excellent thing and an object worthy of <lb/>
            all labour, that our mind shall not be mounted upon any one <lb/>
            of the passions or vices, but that whenever an attempt is made <lb/>
            by force to put it upon one of them, we must endeavour to leap <lb/>
            off and fall, for such falls produce the most glorious victories. <lb/>
            On which account one of the ancients, when challenged to a <lb/>
            contest of abuse, said, " I will never engage in such a contest <lb/>
            as that in which lie who wins is more dishonoured than he who <lb/>
            is defeated."</p>
          <p>XXV. Do you, therefore, my friend, never enter into a con­ <lb/>
            test of evil, and never contend for the pre-eminence in such <lb/>
            practices, but rather exert yourself with all your might to <lb/>
            escape from them. And if ever, being under the compulsion <lb/>
            of some power which is mightier than yourself, you are com­ <lb/>
            pelled to engage in such a strife, take care to be without delay <lb/>
            defeated ; for then you, being defeated, will be a glorious con­ <lb/>
            queror, and those who have gained the victory will have got <lb/>
            the worst. And do not ever entrust it to a herald to proclaim <lb/>
            the victory'of your rival or to the judge to crown ; but do you <lb/>
            go yourself and offer to him the acknowledgment of victory and <lb/>
            the palm, and crown him, if he will, and bind him with wreaths <lb/>
            of triumph, and proclaim him as conqueror yourself, pronounc­ <lb/>
            <pb n="401"/>
             <lb/>
            ing with a loud and piercing voice such a proclamation as this<lb/>
            <lb/>
            " O ye spectators, and ye who have offered prizes at these<lb/>
            games! In this contest which you have proposed to us of appe- <lb/>
            tite,and passion, and intemperance, and folly, and injustice, I <lb/>
            have been defeated, and , this man whom ye behold has gained <lb/>
            the victory. And he has gained it by such a superabundance <lb/>
            of excellence, that even we who might very naturally have<lb/>
            envied our conquerors, do not grudge him the triumph."</p>
          <p>Therefore, in all these unholy contest, surrender the prizes.<lb/>
            to others ; but, as for those which are really holy, study <lb/>
            yourself to gain the crown in them. And think not those con- <lb/>
            tests holy which the different cities propose in their triennial <lb/>
            festivals, when they build theatres and receive many myriads <lb/>
            of people; for in those he who has overthrown any one in<lb/>
            <lb/>
            wrestling, or who has cast him on his back or on his face upon <lb/>
            the ground, or he who is very skilful in wrestling or in the <lb/>
            pancratium, carries off the first prize, though he may be a man <lb/>
            who.has never abstained from any act of may violence or of<lb/>
            injustice.</p>
          <p>XXVI. There are some men, again, who, having armed <lb/>
            and strongly fortified both their hands in a most hard and<lb/>
            terrible manner, like iron, attack their adversaries, and batter<lb/>
            their heads and faces, and the other parts of their bodies<lb/>
            and whenever they are able to plant a blow, they infliet great <lb/>
            fractures, and then claim the decision in their favour, and <lb/>
            the crown of victory, by means of their merciles cruelty<lb/>
            But what man in his senses would not laugh at the other<lb/>
            competitions of runners, and candidates for the prize in the<lb/>
            pentathlum, to see men studying with all their energies to<lb/>
            leap the longest distance, and measuring spaces and distances,<lb/>
            and contending with one another in swiftuess of foot? men<lb/>
            whom, not only those more active animals, an antelope, or a<lb/>
            deer, but even the very smallest beasts, such as a dog, or a<lb/>
            hare, without making any extraordinary haste, would outrun,<lb/>
            though they were to exert themselves with all their speed,<lb/>
            and to put themselves out of breath.</p>
          <p>Of all these contests, then, there is not one which is truly <lb/>
            sacred; no, not though all the men in the world should<lb/>
            combine to bear witness in their favour, but they must be<lb/>
            convicted bear by witness of hearing false witness if they do <lb/>
            so: for they who admire these things have established laws <note type="footnote"> D D</note> <lb/>
             <pb n="402"/>
            against men who behave with insolent violence, and have <lb/>
            affixed punishments to assaults, and have appointed judges <lb/>
            to decide on every action of that kind. How, then, is it <lb/>
            natural for the same persons to be indignant at those who <lb/>
            insult and assault others privately, and to establish in their <lb/>
            cases punishments which cannot be avoided, but yet, in the <lb/>
            case of those who commit these assaults publicly, and in <lb/>
            assemblies of the people, and in theatres, to establish by law <lb/>
            that they shall receive crowns, and that proclamations shall <lb/>
            be made in their honour, and all sorts of other glorious <lb/>
            circumstances? For when two opposite opinions are esta­ <lb/>
            blished concerning any one thing, whether it be person or <lb/>
            action, it follows of necessity that one or other of them must <lb/>
            be wrong, and the other right, for it is impossible for them <lb/>
            both to be right: which of the two, then, will you praise <lb/>
            deservedly ? Will you not say that that sentence is right <lb/>
            which orders those who begin acts of violence to be punished ? <lb/>
            You would justly blame the contrary law, which commands <lb/>
            such persons to be honoured; that nothing sacred may be <lb/>
            blamed, every such thing must be altogether glorious.</p>
          <p>XXVII. Therefore the Olympian contest is the only one <lb/>
            that justly deserves to be called sacred ; meaning by this, not <lb/>
            that which the inhabitants of Elis celebrate, but that which <lb/>
            is instituted for the acquisition of the divine, and Olympian, <lb/>
            and genuine virtues. Now, as competitors in this contest, <lb/>
            all those have their names inscribed who are very weak in <lb/>
            their bodies, but very vigorous in their souls; and then, <lb/>
            having stripped off their clothes, and smeared themselves in <lb/>
            the dust, they do all those actions which belong to skill and <lb/>
            to power, omitting nothing which may conduce to their gaining <lb/>
            the victory. These men, therefore, get the better of their <lb/>
            adversaries: and then, again, they have a competition with <lb/>
            one another for the prize of pre-eminence, for they are not <lb/>
            all' victorious in the same manner, but all are worthy of <lb/>
            honour, having routed and overthrown most grievous and <lb/>
            formidable enemies ; and he who shows himself superior to <lb/>
            all the rest of these is most admirable, and we must not <lb/>
            envy him, when he gets the first prize of all the wrestlers. <lb/>
            And those who are thought worthy of the second or of the <lb/>
            third place, must not be cast down ; for these prizes are <lb/>
            proposed for the acquisition of virtue. But to those who are <lb/>
             <pb n="403"/>
            unable to attain to the very highest eminence, even the <lb/>
            acquisition of a moderate prize is serviceable. And it is even <lb/>
            said that such is more stable, since it avoids the envy which <lb/>
            always sticks to those who are excessively eminent.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is said in a way to convey much instruction, <lb/>
            " The horseman will fall," that if any one falls from vice, he <lb/>
            may be raised up by leaning on good things, and so may <lb/>
            stand upright again. And in a still more instructive manner <lb/>
            is that other expression used, which bids one not leap off in <lb/>
            front, but " fall backwards," since it is always advantageous to <lb/>
            be behind-hand in vice and passion ; for it is always good to <lb/>
            be beforehand in doing what is good, but to be slack in doing <lb/>
            what is disgraceful : and, on the other hand, it is good to <lb/>
            come close to the one, but to stand aloof from and to be as <lb/>
            far as possible removed from the other. And that man is <lb/>
            free from all disorder, to whom it happens to be removed at <lb/>
            a distance from the errors of passion. Accordingly, Moses <lb/>
            says that he is " awaiting the salvation which comes from <lb/>
            God,"* in order that, as far as he is removed from committing <lb/>
            iniquity, so far he may also advance in well-doing.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. Everything, then, that is requisite has now been <lb/>
            said on the subject of a horseman and a rider, and a keeper of <lb/>
            sheep and a shepherd, and a tiller of the ground and a husband­ <lb/>
            man ; and all the difference existing between each of these <lb/>
            pairs has been very accurately defined, as far as it was in our <lb/>
            power. It is time now to turn to what follows.</p>
          <p>Moses, then, introduces the man who is desirous of virtue as <lb/>
            not possessing a complete knowledge of the whole business of <lb/>
            a husbandman, but only as labouring with diligence at its prin­ <lb/>
            ciples and rudiments; for he says, " Noah began to be a <lb/>
            husbandman.”† And the beginning, as the proverb of the old <lb/>
            writers has it, is half of the whole ; as yet, therefore, he is half <lb/>
            of the distance removed from the end, and where the end is <lb/>
            not attained, it has been often injurious to many persons, to <lb/>
            have begun great enterprises. At all events, before now, some <lb/>
            persons whose minds were not right, through their thoughts <lb/>
            revolving in continued changes, have conceived a notion of <lb/>
            some good things, but have derived no advantage from it; for <lb/>
            it has happened that, as they did not attain the end which they <lb/>
            desired, they have been overwhelmed by the impetuosity of a <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis ix, 20. </note> <note type="footnote"> DD2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="404"/>
            number of adverse circumstances coming against them, and <lb/>
            so that good conception has been destroyed.</p>
          <p>XXIX. Was it not on this account that when Cain fancied <lb/>
            that he had offered up a blameless sacrifice, an oracle came <lb/>
            to him bidding him not to feel confidence as a man who had <lb/>
            presented a well approved offering ? for that he had not <lb/>
            sacrificed with holy and perfect victims.</p>
          <p>And the oracle is as follows : " If thou dost not bring thy <lb/>
            offering properly, and if thou dost not distribute it rightly.”* <lb/>
            What is right, then, here is the honour of God, and that <lb/>
            which is not properly distributed is not right. But let us <lb/>
            now examine what meaning is contained under this expres­ <lb/>
            sion.</p>
          <p>There are some persons who look upon piety as consisting <lb/>
            in the affirmation that all things have been made by God, <lb/>
            both what is good and the contrary; to whom we would say <lb/>
            that one portion of your opinion is praiseworthy, but the <lb/>
            other portion blameable. One portion is praiseworthy, be­ <lb/>
            cause it properly honours that which alone is worthy to <lb/>
            receive honour; but that portion is blameable, which docs <lb/>
            so without any discrimination or division. For it was not <lb/>
            proper to confuse and mingle everything together, nor to <lb/>
            declare God the cause of everything without distinction, but <lb/>
            to make a difference, and to pronounce him the cause only <lb/>
            of those things which are good ; for it is an absurdity to be <lb/>
            anxious about priests, taking care that they shall be perfect <lb/>
            in their bodies and free from all defect and mutilation, and <lb/>
            to be very particular about the animals which are offered in <lb/>
            sacrifice, to be sure that they have no defect of any kind <lb/>
            whatever, not even the most insignificant possible; and to <lb/>
            appoint men, and to say whom and how many ought to be <lb/>
            appointed for this business, whom some call inspectors of <lb/>
            blemishes, to take care that the victims may be brought to <lb/>
            the altar without any blemish or imperfection, and yet to <lb/>
            allow the opinions which are held concerning God to be in <lb/>
            confusion in the soul of each individual, and not to take care <lb/>
            that they are discriminated by the rule of right reason.</p>
          <p>XXX. Do you not see that the law pronounces the camel <lb/>
            to be an unclean beast, because it chews the cud and does <lb/>
            not part the hoof.† And yet, if we considered this sentence <note type="footnote"> * Genesis iv. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xi. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="405"/>
            as it is expressed in its literal sense, I do not see what <lb/>
            reason there is in it when it is interpreted ; but if we look at <lb/>
            it in its allegorical meaning, it is very clear and inevitable. <lb/>
            For as the animal which chews the cud, again masticates the <lb/>
            food which is put before it and devoured by it, when it again <lb/>
            rises up to its teeth, so also the soul of the man who is fond <lb/>
            of learning, when it has received any speculative opinions by <lb/>
            hearing them, does not abandon them to forgetfulness, but <lb/>
            quietly by itself revolves over every one of them again in its <lb/>
            mind in all tranquillity, and so comes to the recollection of <lb/>
            them all. But it is, not every memory which is good, but <lb/>
            only that which is exerted on good subjects, since it is a most <lb/>
            pernicious thing that what is bad should not be forgotten ; <lb/>
            on which account, with a view to perfection, it is necessary <lb/>
            that the hoofs should be parted, in order that so the faculty <lb/>
            of memory, being divided into two sections, the word which <lb/>
            flows through the mouth may divide the lips, as being things <lb/>
            which nature has made of a two-fold character, and may also <lb/>
            separate the advantageous species of memory from that <lb/>
            which is mischievous.</p>
          <p>Again, the dividing the hoof without chewing the cud <lb/>
            does not by itself appear to bring any advantage with it. <lb/>
            For what advantage is there in distinguishing the natures <lb/>
            of things beginning at the top, and going down to the most <lb/>
            unimportant points, and yet not to be able to do so in one's <lb/>
            self, not to have one's own divisions clearly distinguished, <lb/>
            which by some persons are with great felicity named atoms <lb/>
            and indivisible portions ? for all these things are manifest <lb/>
            displays of intelligence and excessive accuracy, sharpened <lb/>
            to a degree of the most acute comprehension. But they <lb/>
            have no influence in causing virtue, or in making men live <lb/>
            a life free from reproach.</p>
          <p>XXXI. Accordingly, in their daily discussions, the com­ <lb/>
            pany of sophists all over the world annoys the ears of those <lb/>
            whom they meet, by discussing with minute accuracy, and <lb/>
            expounding precisely, all expressions of a double and ambi­ <lb/>
            guous character, and distinguishing everything which <lb/>
            appears to occur to the recollection (and a great many <lb/>
            things are fixed deeply in it). Do not these men divide the <lb/>
            elements of grammatical speech into consonants and vowels ? <lb/>
            And do not some men divide speech into their first princi­ <lb/>
             <pb n="406"/>
            pies, noun, verb, and conjunction ? Do not musicians <lb/>
            again divide their own science into rhythm, and part, and <lb/>
            melody ? and subdivide melody into the chromatic, the <lb/>
            enharmonic, and the diatonic species, into the divisions of <lb/>
            fourths, and fifths, and the diapason, and into combined and <lb/>
            distinct melodies ? Do not geometricians divide their <lb/>
            science into two generic lines, the straight line, and the <lb/>
            circumference ? And do not other professors of other arts <lb/>
            draw careful distinctions between the species which exist in <lb/>
            each of their arts, going accurately through them all from <lb/>
            beginning to end ? And the whole company of students <lb/>
            of philosophy may argue with them on their line of conduct, <lb/>
            each going through the studies to which he is accustomed ; <lb/>
            because, of all existing things some are corporeal, and some <lb/>
            incorporeal; some again are inanimate, and some have vitality; <lb/>
            some are endowed with, others destitute of reason ; some are <lb/>
            mortal, others divine; and of mortals some are male, and <lb/>
            some female, these being the two divisions of the human <lb/>
            race. Again, of incorporeal things, some are perfect and <lb/>
            others imperfect; and of perfect things, some are questions <lb/>
            and interrogations, others are imprecatory or adjurative ; and <lb/>
            there are other kinds which have special differences in the <lb/>
            elementary principles of such things.</p>
          <p>Again, there are some things which the dialecticians are <lb/>
            accustomed to call actions ; and of these some are simple, <lb/>
            and others are not simple; and of those which are not <lb/>
            simple some are conjunctive, and others are adjunctive in a <lb/>
            greater or lesser degree; moreover some are disjunctive, and <lb/>
            there are others which come under a similar description. <lb/>
            Again, some are true, some are false, some are doubtful; <lb/>
            some possible and some impossible ; some are corruptible, <lb/>
            others incorruptible; some necessary, and others not neces­ <lb/>
            sary ; some are easy of solution, others difficult to understand; <lb/>
            and there are other classifications akin to these. Again, of <lb/>
            those which are imperfect there are proximate divisions into <lb/>
            what are called categorems and accidents, and other classi­ <lb/>
            fications which are subordinate to these.</p>
          <p>XXXII. And although the intellect, when it has sharp­ <lb/>
            ened itself so as to render itself more acute than before (as <lb/>
            a physician gives strength to bodies), dissects the natures of <lb/>
            things, but yet derives no advantage with respect to the <lb/>
             <pb n="407"/>
            acquisition of virtue ; it will divide the hoof, being able to <lb/>
            divide, and to distinguish, and to discriminate between each <lb/>
            separate thing; but it will not chew the cud so as to avail <lb/>
            itself of any useful food which may be able, by means of its <lb/>
            recollections, to soften the asperity of the soul which has <lb/>
            been engendered by sins, and to produce a really gentle <lb/>
            and pleasant motion. Therefore a vast number of those <lb/>
            who are called sophists, being admired in their respective <lb/>
            cities, and having attracted almost all the world to look <lb/>
            upon them with honour, on account of the accuracy of their <lb/>
            definitions and their excessive cleverness in inventions, have <lb/>
            grown old while vehemently bound by the passions, and <lb/>
            have passed their whole life in them, in no respect differing <lb/>
            from private individuals who are of no account and are held <lb/>
            in no consideration. For which reason the lawgiver very <lb/>
            admirally compares those of the sophists who live in this <lb/>
            manner to the race of swine, who live a life in no respect <lb/>
            pure or brilliant, but confused and disorderly, and who are <lb/>
            devoted to the basest habits.</p>
          <p>For he says that the swine is an <unclear>unclean</unclear> animal, because <lb/>
            it divides the hoof and does not chew the cud, just as he <lb/>
            has pronounced the camel unclean for the contrary reason <lb/>
            because it chews the cud and does not divide the hoof. <lb/>
            But as many animals as partake of both these qualities are <lb/>
            very appropriately described as clean, because they have <lb/>
            avoided impropriety in both the aforementioned particulars. <lb/>
            For division, without memory, and care, and a diligent exami­ <lb/>
            nation of what is best, is but an imperfect good; but the <lb/>
            combination and union of the two in the same animal is a <lb/>
            most perfect good.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. And even the enemies of the soul are afraid <lb/>
            of this perfection, whom, as they are no longer able to stand <lb/>
            up against it, a genuine peace gets the mastery over. And <lb/>
            all those who have attained to a half-perfect or half-esta­ <lb/>
            blished wisdom, are too weak to be able to make any effectual <lb/>
            opposition to the brood of sins, which have become confined by <lb/>
            long usage, and which have gained strength by time. On <lb/>
            this account, when in the time of war the general makes a <lb/>
            levy of his army, he does not summon all the youth, not even, <lb/>
            though it displays all imaginable willingness and spontaneous <lb/>
            readiness to come forward to repel the enemy. But he <lb/>
             <pb n="408"/>
            commands some to depart and to remain at home, in order <lb/>
            that by continued exercise they may acquire such an amount <lb/>
            of military power and skill as may afterwards be sufficient <lb/>
            to secure the victory.</p>
          <p>And the order of this levy is made through the medium <lb/>
            of the heralds of the army when the war is at hand, and <lb/>
            already at the very gates. And the heralds will make this <lb/>
            announcement: " What man is there who has built a new <lb/>
            house, and has not handselled it ? Let him go and return <lb/>
            to his house, that he may not die in the war, and another <lb/>
            man handsel it instead of him. And what man is there who <lb/>
            has planted a vineyard and has not received any joy from the <lb/>
            fruit thereof? Let him go and turn away back to his house, <lb/>
            that he may not die in the war, and another man be delight­ <lb/>
            ed with the fruit of his vineyard. And what man has <lb/>
            espoused a wife, and has not received her ? Let him go and <lb/>
            return back to his house, that he may not die in the war, <lb/>
            and another man take his wife.*</p>
          <p>XXXIV. For why, I should say, 0 most excellent man, <lb/>
            do you not think it more proper to summon these men to <lb/>
            follow you to the contest of war rather than the others, men <lb/>
            who have acquired marriages, and houses, and vineyards, and <lb/>
            all other kinds of possessions in abundance ? For they will <lb/>
            most cheerfully undergo dangers, even if they be altogether <lb/>
            most formidable, for the sake of the safety of all these things. <lb/>
            Since those men who have none of these things which have <lb/>
            been enumerated will be very likely to exhibit indifference <lb/>
            and inactivity in the war, as having no very important <lb/>
            pledges at stake. Or do you think that, just in proportion <lb/>
            to the absence of any enjoyment from the possession of such <lb/>
            things that they have hitherto felt, will be their apprehension <lb/>
            lest they never be able to enjoy such things, and that this <lb/>
            will give them energy ? For what advantage from all the <lb/>
            possessions that they may have acquired is left to those who <lb/>
            have been subdued in war ? But will they not be taken <lb/>
            prisoners ? Then they will immediately suffer for their ab­ <lb/>
            sence from the field of battle; for while they are sitting at <lb/>
            home and wallowing in luxury, it is evidently inevitable that <lb/>
            their enemies, who are conducting all the operations of the <lb/>
            war with energy, will, not merely without any loss, but even <lb/>
            without the slightest exertion, make themselves masters of <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xx. 5. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="409"/>
            all that they possess. But the multitude of their other allies <lb/>
            will cheerfully encounter the contest on behalf of these <lb/>
            things. At first sight, indeed, it seems absurd to rely upon <lb/>
            the energies or fortune of others ; and especially when it is <lb/>
            both an individual and a common danger, involving defeat, <lb/>
            and slavery, and utter destruction, which hangs over men's <lb/>
            heads, who are able of themselves to encounter the toils and <lb/>
            perils of war, and who are not hindered by any disease, or <lb/>
            by old age, or by any other disaster. It is rather fitting <lb/>
            that those, whom the danger chiefly concerns, should seize <lb/>
            their arms and stand in the front battalions and hold their <lb/>
            shields over their allies, fighting cheerfully and with a spirit <lb/>
            which even courts dangers.</p>
          <p>XXXV. In the next place, will they not have displayed <lb/>
            examples, not of treachery only, but of the greatest insensi­ <lb/>
            bility, if they allow others to fight in their cause, while they <lb/>
            themselves are occupied about their domestic affairs ? And <lb/>
            shall others be willing to incur contests and dangers in the <lb/>
            cause of their safety, which they are afraid to encounter for <lb/>
            their own ? And shall others cheerfully endure scarcity of <lb/>
            provisions, and sleeping on the ground, and other hardships <lb/>
            of body and soul, from their desire for victory, while they, <lb/>
            covering their houses with stucco and nonsense, so much <lb/>
            lifeless ornament, or gathering in their harvests from their <lb/>
            fields, and celebrating the festival of the vintage, or coming <lb/>
            into connection, now for the first time, with virgins who <lb/>
            have long since been betrothed to them, and sleeping with <lb/>
            them, as if it were the most opportune season for marriage, <lb/>
            pass their time in such vanities ? It is a good thing, no <lb/>
            doubt, to take care of one's walls, to collect one's revenues, <lb/>
            to feast, to revel in wine, to contract marriages, to go court­ <lb/>
            ing the old and withered dames (as the proverb calls them) ; <lb/>
            but these are the employments of peace, and to do all these <lb/>
            things in the crisis of a war raging in all its freshness and <lb/>
            vigour, while neither father, nor brother, nor any relation or <lb/>
            connection whatever shares the fatigues of the war; when <lb/>
            this, I say, is the case, must we not say that universal <lb/>
            cowardice has occupied the whole house r Oh, but you will <lb/>
            say there are at all events myriads of relations who are fight­ <lb/>
            ing in their cause. Then, while they are encountering <lb/>
            danger to their lives, must not those who are spending their <lb/>
             <pb n="410"/>
            time in luxury and delicate living appear to surpass even <lb/>
            the worst of wild beasts in the excess of their inhumanity ? <lb/>
            Again, they will say, but it is hard that others, without <lb/>
            enduring any labour themselves, should reap the fruits of <lb/>
            our labours. Which, then, is worst, that enemies should <lb/>
            come into one's inheritance while one is still alive, or that <lb/>
            friends and relations should do so after one is dead ? It is <lb/>
            absurdity even to compare things which are so widely <lb/>
            different; and yet it is not inconsistent with reason, not only <lb/>
            that all the property which belongs to these men who shun <lb/>
            military service, but that even they themselves, too, may <lb/>
            become the property of their enemies when they have ob­ <lb/>
            tained the mastery. So those, indeed, who die in defence <lb/>
            of the general safety, even if they have not enjoyed as yet <lb/>
            any advantage from those possessions which they previously <lb/>
            had, meet with death in its most pleasant form, considering <lb/>
            that, by their saving the others, their property goes to those <lb/>
            whom they desired to have for their successors.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Therefore the words of the law here admit, <lb/>
            perhaps, of all these and even of still more excuses; but <lb/>
            that no one of those who study evil cunning, through his in­ <lb/>
            genuity in devising excuses, may feel any confidence in their <lb/>
            validity, we will proceed with the allegory, and say that, in <lb/>
            the first place, the law does not only think it right for men <lb/>
            to labour for the acquisition of good things, but also for the <lb/>
            enjoyment of those which they have already acquired; and <lb/>
            that it looks upon happiness as consisting in the exercise of <lb/>
            perfect virtue, which makes life safe and complete. In the <lb/>
            second place, that the question here is not about a house, or <lb/>
            a vineyard, or a betrothed and espoused wife, in order that <lb/>
            he may marry her as an accepted suitor, and that he who <lb/>
            planted the vineyard may gather the fruit thereof and press <lb/>
            it out, and then, drinking the unmixed wine, may be gladdened <lb/>
            in his heart, and that the man who has built a house may <lb/>
            dwell in it; but the question is rather about the faculties of <lb/>
            the soul, to which the beginnings, and progress, and perfec­ <lb/>
            tion of all praiseworthy actions are owing. Now, the begin­ <lb/>
            nings have usually <unclear>especial</unclear> connection with a suitor; for as <lb/>
            he who courts a wife is about to become her husband, since <lb/>
            he is not so already, so in the same manner whoever, endued <lb/>
            with a good disposition, hopes to marry that well-born and <lb/>
             <pb n="411"/>
            pure maiden, education, courts her immediately. Progress <lb/>
            has especial reference to the husbandman; for as it is an <lb/>
            object of particular care to the planter to make his trees <lb/>
            grow, so also is it to him, who is devoted to learning, that the <lb/>
            speculations of wisdom should receive the greatest possible <lb/>
            improvement. And perfection especially belongs to the <lb/>
            building of a house when it is finished, but has not yet <lb/>
            settled and become firm.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. But in all these different circumstances, at the <lb/>
            beginning, or in the progress, or at the end of any under- <lb/>
            taking, it is alike becoming to men to live without con­ <lb/>
            tention, and not engage in the war of the sophists, which is <lb/>
            always stirring up a quarrelsome confusion, which tends to <lb/>
            the adulteration of the truth; since the truth is dear to <lb/>
            peace, which is at variance with their interests. For if they <lb/>
            come to this contest, being private individuals engaging in a <lb/>
            struggle against men experienced in warfare, they will by <lb/>
            all means be defeated; the one who is only beginning, because <lb/>
            he is destitute of experience; the one who is in a state of <lb/>
            progress, because he is still imperfect; and the one who is <lb/>
            perfect, because he is not yet thoroughly practised in virtue. <lb/>
            But just as it is necessary that plaster, after [it has been <lb/>
            applied to a wall, must become solid and acquire firmness, so <lb/>
            also it is indispensable that the souls of those who have <lb/>
            attained to perfection, must become strengthened, and be <lb/>
            established on firmer foundations by continual study and inces­ <lb/>
            sant practice. And those who do not arrive at this point are <lb/>
            by philosophers indeed called wise men, but it is without their <lb/>
            own knowledge ; for they say that it is impossible for them <lb/>
            who have advanced as far as the perfection of wisdom, and <lb/>
            who have now for the first time reached its summit to <lb/>
            be aware of their own perfection ; for they affirm that it is <lb/>
            impossible for both these things to happen at the same time, <lb/>
            namely the arrival at the desired goal, and the apprehension <lb/>
            that one has arrived there; but they affirm that on the <lb/>
            border between the two, there is ignorance, of such a sort, <lb/>
            that it is not far removed from knowledge, but that it is <lb/>
            very near to it, and close to its doors.</p>
          <p>When a man has acquired this, and thoroughly com­ <lb/>
            prebends it, and is entirely acquainted with the powers of <lb/>
            his adversaries, it will be his task to war against the com­ <lb/>
             <pb n="412"/>
            pany of contentions sophists, for there is good hope that <lb/>
            such a man may conquer; but he who is still impeded by <lb/>
            the cloud of ignorance in front of him, and who is not yet <lb/>
            able to pour forth the light of knowledge, may safely remain <lb/>
            at home ; that is to say, it is well for him not to enter into <lb/>
            a contest with respect to those matters with which he is not <lb/>
            thoroughly acquainted, but he had better rest and keep <lb/>
            quiet.</p>
          <p>But the man who is elevated by self-sufficiency, not being <lb/>
            acquainted with the skill or power of his adversaries, will <lb/>
            undoubtedly meet with disaster before he can do anything, <lb/>
            and will endure the death of knowledge, which is a more <lb/>
            grievous death than that which separates the soul from the <lb/>
            body. And this ought to happen to those who allow them­ <lb/>
            selves to be deceived by the sophists; for when they are not <lb/>
            able to find a solution for their sophisms, believing their <lb/>
            fallacies as if they were true statements, they die as to the <lb/>
            life of knowledge, suffering the same thing that they do who <lb/>
            are cajoled by flatterers; for in the case of those men too, <lb/>
            their soul, while in a healthy and genuine state, is driven <lb/>
            off and overthrown by a friendship which is diseased in its <lb/>
            very nature.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. We must therefore advise those who are <lb/>
            beginning to learn not to go forth into such contests, for <lb/>
            they have not sufficient knowledge; and we must counsel <lb/>
            those who are making some progress to abstain from them, <lb/>
            because they are not perfect; and those who have now for <lb/>
            the first time just attained to perfection, we must urge to <lb/>
            forbear, because in some degree their perfection has escaped <lb/>
            their own notice. But of those who disregard our warnings, <lb/>
            Moses says, " One man will inhabit his house, and another will <lb/>
            obtain his vineyard, and another will marry a wife." And <lb/>
            the meaning of this is something of this kind: the powers <lb/>
            which have been enumerated, of careful beginning, and <lb/>
            improvement, and perfection, will never fail altogether, but <lb/>
            will at different times approach and unite themselves with <lb/>
            different persons, and will not be always forming the same <lb/>
            souls, but will change about, resembling seals; for seals, <lb/>
            when they have stamped an impression on one piece of wax, <lb/>
            without suffering any alteration themselves, though they <lb/>
            impress on it a form which is derived from themselves, <lb/>
             <pb n="413"/>
            remain in the same condition as before; and if the piece of <lb/>
            wax which has been stamped, be melted, and the impres­ <lb/>
            sion effaced, then another piece may be substituted in its <lb/>
            place.</p>
          <p>So that, my good friends, do not think, that when you <lb/>
            yourselves perish, your powers perish with you; for they, <lb/>
            being immortal, have, on account of their own glory, <lb/>
            embraced ten thousand other persons before they came to <lb/>
            you, who, they perceived, did not behave like you, out of <lb/>
            an aversion to danger, shunning their society, but who <lb/>
            rather came forward to meet them, and showed an eagerness <lb/>
            to consult their safety. And if any one is a friend of virtue, <lb/>
            let him pray that all good things may be implanted in him, <lb/>
            and may appear in his soul, like some symmetrical propor­ <lb/>
            tion conducing to beauty in a statue or a picture, con­ <lb/>
            sidering that there are innumerable persons watching at <lb/>
            hand, to whom nature will give all these things instead of <lb/>
            giving them to him, namely, facility of learning, improvement, <lb/>
            and perfection; but it is better that he should shine out <lb/>
            rather than they, guarding safely the graces which have <lb/>
            been bestowed on him by God; and that he himself should <lb/>
            not, by carrying forward destruction, afford an easy prey to <lb/>
            his unsparing enemies.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. Are we then to say that there is but little use <lb/>
            in a beginning to which a fortunate end does not set its <lb/>
            seal ? It has often indeed happened that even some who <lb/>
            have attained to perfection have still been thought im­ <lb/>
            perfect, from appearing to have improved through their own <lb/>
            earnestness alone, and not according to the will of God. <lb/>
            And on this account, being exceedingly elated by their vain <lb/>
            opinion, and elevated to a great height, they have fallen <lb/>
            from a high position to the lowest depths, and so been <lb/>
            destroyed. "For if," says Moses, "you have built a new <lb/>
            house, you shall also erect a battlement on the house, and <lb/>
            then shall commit no murder in your house if any one falls <lb/>
            from it."* For the most grievous of all falls is for a man <lb/>
            to stumble and fall from the honour due to God; crowning <lb/>
            himself rather than God, and committing domestic murder. <lb/>
            For he who docs not duly honour the living God kills his <lb/>
            own soul: so that the building of education which he has <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="414"/>
            erected is of no advantage to him. But instruction has a <lb/>
            nature which never grows old; on which account Moses <lb/>
            calls its house a new house, for all other things are gradually <lb/>
            destroyed by time. But instruction, in proportion as it <lb/>
            advances towards perfection, is fresh and vigorous, looking <lb/>
            blooming with an ever-flourishing appearance, and putting <lb/>
            itself in motion with continual studies.</p>
          <p>And in his hortatory admonitions Moses recommends that <lb/>
            those who have received the most abundant possession of <lb/>
            good things should not look upon themselves as the causes <lb/>
            of their acquisition, but should "remember God who gave <lb/>
            them strength to acquire the power."* This then is the <lb/>
            utmost limit of good fortune, and the other things are its <lb/>
            beginnings, so that those who forget the end cannot possibly <lb/>
            derive any advantage from the acquisitions which they have <lb/>
            made. And so the falls which these men endure are self­ <lb/>
            incurred, through their own self-sufficiency, because they <lb/>
            could not endure to call the loving and all-accomplishing <lb/>
            God the cause of their good things.</p>
          <p>XL. There are also some people who, letting loose every <lb/>
            cable of piety, hasten to make a speedy voyage, in the hope <lb/>
            of anchoring in its harbours. And afterwards, when they are <lb/>
            at no great distance off, but are just on the point of <lb/>
            reaching the haven, on a sudden there comes a violent wind, <lb/>
            blowing in their teeth and coming upon them closely, which <lb/>
            drives back the vessel which was proceeding onwards in its <lb/>
            straight course, in such a manner as to destroy a great <lb/>
            many of the things which were of use to contribute to a <lb/>
            fair voyage ; no one then could blame those people for being <lb/>
            still tossed about by the sea, for the slowness, which they <lb/>
            have displayed in completing their voyage, has been uninten­ <lb/>
            tional on their part. Who then can be likened to them <lb/>
            rather than he who prayed what is called the great prayer ? <lb/>
            " For if," says Moses, " any one dies in his presence <lb/>
            suddenly, then immediately the head of his vow shall be <lb/>
            polluted and he shall be shaved;”† and then after saying a <lb/>
            few more sentences he thus proceeds, "And the former days <lb/>
            shall not be taken into the computation, because the head <lb/>
            of his vow was polluted." Now by the two expressions <note type="footnote"> <unclear/>* Deuteronomy viii. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers vi. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="415"/>
            suddenly and immediately, the involuntary character of the <lb/>
            deviation of the soul is manifested.</p>
          <p>For with reference to intentional sins there is need of <lb/>
            time to consider where, and when, and how a thing is to be <lb/>
            done. But unintentional sins are committed suddenly, <lb/>
            without any consideration, and, if it be possible to say such <lb/>
            a thing they strike upon the man without any time at all. <lb/>
            For it is very difficult, as in the case of runners, for men, <lb/>
            when they first begin to travel by the road which leads to <lb/>
            piety, to keep their course straight onward without <lb/>
            stumbling and without being out of breath ; since there <lb/>
            are innumerable hindrances to every human being, but <lb/>
            above all things, that which is the one and only thing in the <lb/>
            way of doing good, namely the abstaining from any inten­ <lb/>
            tional misdeeds, is of service also to keep off the incalculable <lb/>
            number of voluntary sins; and, in the second place, even of <lb/>
            those which are involuntary, they are but few which are <lb/>
            committed, and they do not cling to a person for any very <lb/>
            long time.</p>
          <p>Very beautifully, therefore, has Moses said that the days <lb/>
            of unintentional error do not come into the computation <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄλογος</foreign>); not only because the error was one without <lb/>
            calculation, but also because it is not possible to give an <lb/>
            account (<foreign xml:lang="grc">λόγος</foreign>) of involuntary offences. Therefore, it often <lb/>
            happens, when we are asked the reason of such and such a <lb/>
            thing, that we say that we do not know, and that we cannot <lb/>
            tell, in that we were not present when they were done, and <lb/>
            also that we were ignorant of their being done. It is, there­ <lb/>
            fore, a very rare thing when God gives to any one to keep <lb/>
            his life in a steady course from the beginning to the end, <lb/>
            without either stumbling or falling; but escaping both kinds <lb/>
            of offences, unintentional as well as intentional, with great <lb/>
            speed and owing to the celerity and impetuosity of one's <lb/>
            motions.</p>
          <p>These things then are here said about beginning and end, <lb/>
            because of the instance of the just Noah, who, after he had <lb/>
            acquired the first and elementary principles of the knowledge <lb/>
            of husbandry, was unable to reach its furthest limits. For <lb/>
            it is said that " he began to be a husbandman, " not that he <lb/>
            arrived at the extreme end of complete knowledge: but what <lb/>
            is said about his planting we will discuss subsequently.</p>

            <title type="main">THE SECOND PART OF THE TREATISE ABOUT THE PLANTING OF NOAH.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. IN the former part of this treatise we have spoken of <lb/>
            the art of husbandry as to its genus, dwelling on it at as <lb/>
            great a length as the time admitted of; but in this book we <lb/>
            will discuss the question of his cultivation of his vineyard <lb/>
            with regard to the species as far as it is in our power. For <lb/>
            Moses represents the just Noah not only as a husbandman, <lb/>
            but also especially as occupied with the cultivation of vines, <lb/>
            saying, " Noah began to be a husbandman of the earth ; and <lb/>
            he planted a vineyard." * And it is fitting that a man who <lb/>
            was about to discuss the whole question of separate plants <lb/>
            and manners of cultivation, should first of all acquire an <lb/>
            accurate comprehension of the most perfect plants in the <lb/>
            universe, and of the great planter and superintendent of <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>He then who is the greatest of all planters and the most <lb/>
            perfect in art, is the Ruler of the universe; and his plant is <lb/>
            not one which comprises within itself only individual plants, <lb/>
            but rather infinite numbers of them springing up like suckers <lb/>
            from one root, namely, this world. For after the Creator of <lb/>
            the world, reducing that substance, which was in its own <lb/>
            nature destitute of order and regularity, into a state of order, <lb/>
            and bringing it from a condition of confusion into a distinct <lb/>
            system, began to fashion and shape it, he placed the earth <lb/>
            and the water in the middle, and the plants of air and fire <lb/>
            he drew up from their previously central position to a lofty <lb/>
            eminence ; and the æther he arranged all round, placing it as <lb/>
            a boundary to and preservation of the things within, from <lb/>
            which also it seems that the heaven t derives its name, <lb/>
            causing the earth to be borne upon the water in such a way <lb/>
            that it continues dry, which, however, there was reason to <lb/>
            fear might be dissolved by water; and this great worker of <lb/>
            marvels, moreover, united the air, which was exceedingly <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> t <foreign xml:lang="grc">Οὐρανὸς</foreign>, "heaven;" as if derived from <foreign xml:lang="grc">ὅρος</foreign> or <foreign xml:lang="grc">οὖρος</foreign>, "a bound­ <lb/>
            ary." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="417"/>
            cold by its own nature, to fire which is very hot; a most <lb/>
            surprising miracle. For how can it be looked upon as any­ <lb/>
            thing but a prodigy, for that which would dissolve another <lb/>
            thing, to be held together by that which it would dissolve : <lb/>
            that is to say, for water to be held together by earth; and <lb/>
            again, for that which is the hottest of all things to be placed <lb/>
            upon that which is the coldest without its nature being de­ <lb/>
            stroyed, that is to say, for fire to be placed upon air ? <lb/>
            And these are the elements of this most perfect plant; but <lb/>
            the very great and all productive plant is this world, of which <lb/>
            the aforesaid branches are the main shoots.</p>
          <p>II. AVe must now therefore consider where God placed <lb/>
            its foundations, and in fact, what foundation it has on which <lb/>
            it is supported, as a statue is on a pedestal; certainly we <lb/>
            cannot imagine that any body is left outside and wandering <lb/>
            about, since God has worked up and arranged every imagi­ <lb/>
            nable material throughout the whole universe. For it was <lb/>
            fitting that the most perfect and greatest of all works should <lb/>
            be made by the greatest of all makers; and it would not <lb/>
            have been the most perfect of works if it had not been <lb/>
            filled up by perfect parts, so that this world consists of <lb/>
            all earth, and all water, and all air, and all fire, not a <lb/>
            single particle, no not the smallest imaginable atom, being <lb/>
            omitted.</p>
          <p>It follows therefore of necessity, that what is outside <lb/>
            must either be a vacuum or nothing at all. If now it is a <lb/>
            vacuum, than how can that which is full and solid, and the <lb/>
            heaviest of all things, avoid being pressed down by its own <lb/>
            weight, since there is no solid thing to hold it up ? from <lb/>
            which consideration it would appear to be something like <lb/>
            a vision, since the mind is always seeking for some corpo­ <lb/>
            real foundation, such as everything which is moved, must <lb/>
            of necessity have; and especially the world, inasmuch as it <lb/>
            is the greatest of all bodies, and embraces a multitude of <lb/>
            other bodies as its own appropriate parts.</p>
          <p>If therefore any one wishes to escape from the difficulties <lb/>
            of this question which present themselves in the different <lb/>
            doubts thus raised, let him speak freely and say that there is <lb/>
            nothing in any material of such power as to be able to sup­ <lb/>
            port this weight of the world. But it is the eternal law <lb/>
            of the everlasting God which is the most supporting an <note type="footnote"> E E </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="418"/>
            firm foundation of the universe. This it is which, being <lb/>
            extended from the centre to the borders, and again from <lb/>
            the extremities to the centre, runs through the whole un­ <lb/>
            subdued course of nature, collecting all the parts and bind­ <lb/>
            ing them firmly together; for the father who created them <lb/>
            has made it the indissoluble bond of the universe. Very <lb/>
            naturally and appropriately therefore, all earth will not be <lb/>
            dissolved by all water, which the bosom of the earth con­ <lb/>
            tains, nor will fire be extinguished by air, nor. again will air <lb/>
            be burnt up by fire, since the divine law establishes itself <lb/>
            as a boundary to all these elements, like a vowel among <lb/>
            consonants, so that the universe may, as it were, be harmo­ <lb/>
            nious in concert with the music expressed by letters ; per­ <lb/>
            suasion, by its own authority, putting an end to the threaten­ <lb/>
            in,, conflicts of contrary natures.</p>
          <p>III. Thus then the plant which bears all things was <lb/>
            rooted, and when it was rooted was made strong. But of <lb/>
            the particular plants, and those of smaller growth, some were <lb/>
            moveable, so as to have their places changed; and some <lb/>
            were made so as, without any such change, to stand steadily <lb/>
            in the same place. Those then that are affected by motion, <lb/>
            inducing change of place, which we call animals, are attached <lb/>
            to the most important portions of the universe; the terres­ <lb/>
            trial animals to the earth, the animals which swim to the <lb/>
            water, the winged animals to the air and those which can <lb/>
            live in the flame to the fire (which last are said to be most <lb/>
            evidently produced in Macedonia), and the stars are attached <lb/>
            to the heaven. For those who have studied philosophy pro­ <lb/>
            nounce the stars also to be animals, being endowed with <lb/>
            intellect and pervading the whole universe; some being <lb/>
            planets, and moving by their own intrinsic nature ; and <lb/>
            others, that is the fixed stars, being borne along with the <lb/>
            revolutions of the universe ; so that they likewise appear to <lb/>
            change their places. But those which are regulated accord­ <lb/>
            ing to a nature devoid of all sensation, which are peculiarly <lb/>
            called plants, have no participation in that motion which in­ <lb/>
            volves a change of place.</p>
          <p>IV. But the Creator made two different races on the earth <lb/>
            and in the air. In the air, he made the winged animals <lb/>
            capable of being perceived by the external senses, and other <lb/>
            powers which can by no means be comprehended in any place <lb/>
             <pb n="419"/>
            by the external senses ; and this is the company of incorpo­ <lb/>
            real souls arranged in order, but not in the same classifications. <lb/>
            For it is said that some are assigned to mortal bodies, and are <lb/>
            again subjected to a'change of place according to certain <lb/>
            defined periodical revolutions; but that others which have <lb/>
            received a more divinely prepared habitation, look down <lb/>
            upon the region of the earth, and that in the highest place, <lb/>
            near the other itself, the purest souls are placed, which <lb/>
            those who have studied philosophy among the Greeks call <lb/>
            heroes, but which Moses, by a felicitous appellation, entitles <lb/>
            angels ; souls which go as ambassadors and messengers of <lb/>
            good from the ruler of all things to his subjects, and messen­ <lb/>
            gers also to the king respecting those things of which his <lb/>
            subjects have heard. To the earth again he assigned two <lb/>
            classes, terrestrial animals and plants, wishing that she should <lb/>
            be at the same time their mother and their nurse. For, as in <lb/>
            the case of woman and every animal of the female sex, foun­ <lb/>
            tains of milk spring up in them when they are about to bring <lb/>
            forth, in order that they may supply the offspring that is born <lb/>
            of them with necessary and suitable food; so in a similar <lb/>
            manner God has assigned to the earth, which is the mother <lb/>
            of all terrestrial animals, all the different species of plants, <lb/>
            in order that the animals produced by the earth may <lb/>
            have such food as is akin to them, and not alien from their <lb/>
            natures.</p>
          <p>And, indeed, God has caused plants to grow with their <lb/>
            heads downwards, having fixed their heads in the deepest <lb/>
            parts of the earth; and having drawn up the heads of the <lb/>
            irrational animals from the earth, he has set them up high on <lb/>
            long necks, putting their fore feet under their necks as a <lb/>
            kind of foundation. But man has received a pre-eminently <lb/>
            superior formation. For of all other animals God has bent <lb/>
            the eyes downwards, so that they look upon the ground ; but <lb/>
            on the other hand, he has raised the eyes of man so that he <lb/>
            may behold the heaven, being not a terrestrial but a celestial <lb/>
            plant as the old proverb is.* <note type="footnote"> * This is similar to what Ovid says — <lb/>
            Pronaque dum spectant animalia cætera terram. <lb/>
            Os homini sublime dedit: ccelumque tueri <lb/>
            Jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus. <lb/>
            Which may be translated-</note> <pb n="420"/>
            </p>
          <p>V. But the others who say that our mind is a portion of <lb/>
            the ethereal nature, have by this assertion attributed to man <lb/>
            a kindred with the air; but the great Moses has not named <lb/>
            the species of the rational soul by a title resembling that of <lb/>
            any created being, but has pronounced it an image of the <lb/>
            divine and invisible being, making it a coin as it were of <lb/>
            sterling metal, stamped and impressed with the seal of God, <lb/>
            the impression of which is the eternal word. For, says <lb/>
            Moses, " God breathed into man's face the breath of life," * <lb/>
            so that it follows of necessity, that he that received the <lb/>
            breath must be fashioned after the model of him who sent it <lb/>
            forth. On which account it is said too, that “Man was made <lb/>
            after the image of God," t and not after the image of any <lb/>
            created being. It follows, therefore, since the soul of man <lb/>
            has been fashioned in accordance with the archetypal word <lb/>
            of the great cause of all things, that his body also, having <lb/>
            been raised up to the purest portion of the universe-the <lb/>
            heaven, must extend its vision, in order that, by a comparison <lb/>
            with what is visible, it may attain to an accurate compre­ <lb/>
            hension of what is invisible.</p>
          <p>Since, therefore, it was impossible for any one to perceive <lb/>
            the attraction of the mind to the living God, except for <lb/>
            those persons alone who were drawn towards him (for that <lb/>
            which each person suffers, he alone particularly knows), God <lb/>
            has given us the eyes of the body (as an evident and visible <lb/>
            image of the invisible eye), which are able to look up to <lb/>
            the heaven ; for when the eyes, composed of perishable <lb/>
            material, have raised themselves to such a height, as to be <lb/>
            able from the region of the earth to mount up to heaven <lb/>
            which is removed at so great a distance from the earth, and to <lb/>
            reach its utmost heights, how great a course in every direction <lb/>
            must we suppose to be within the power of the eyes of the <lb/>
            soul ? which, being endowed with wings from their excessive <lb/>
            desire to see the living God clearly, reach up not only to the <lb/>
            highest regions of the air, but even pass over the boundaries <lb/>
            of the whole world, and hasten towards the Uncreate. <note type="footnote"> And while all other creatures from their birth <lb/>
            With downcast eyes gaze on their kindred earth, <lb/>
            He bids man walk erect, and scan the heaven, <lb/>
            From whence he sprung, to which his hopes are given. </note> <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis i. 27. </note> <pb n="421"/>
            </p>
          <p>VI. On this account, those persons who are insatiable in <lb/>
            their desire for wisdom and knowledge are said in the sacred <lb/>
            oracles to be " called up." * For it is legitimate that those <lb/>
            persons should be called up to the Deity who have been <lb/>
            inspired by him. For it would be a terrible thing if whirl­ <lb/>
            winds and hurricanes have power to tear trees up by their <lb/>
            roots, and to toss them in the air, and to carry off vessels of <lb/>
            many tons' burden, though loaded with cargoes, as if they <lb/>
            were the lightest things imaginable, out of the middle of the <lb/>
            sea; and if even lakes and rivers are raised on high, when <lb/>
            their streams actually leave the bosom of the earth, having <lb/>
            been drawn up by the ardent and diversified eddies of the <lb/>
            winds: and yet, if the mind, which is intrinsically light, <lb/>
            cannot be raised up by the nature of the Divine Spirit, <lb/>
            which is able to do everything and to subdue all things <lb/>
            below, and cannot be elevated to an exceeding height; and <lb/>
            especially the mind of the man who studies philosophy in a <lb/>
            genuine manner. For he does not incline downwards to the <lb/>
            things dear to the body and to the earth, from which he <lb/>
            separates himself, and studies to alienate himself as far as <lb/>
            possible; but he is borne upwards, being insatiably devoted <lb/>
            to sublime, holy, magnificent, and happy natures.</p>
          <p>Therefore, also, Moses will be summoned upwards, the <lb/>
            steward and guardian of the sacred mysteries of the living <lb/>
            God. For we read in the book of Leviticus, " He called <lb/>
            Moses up to him." t Bezeleel also will be summoned up, <lb/>
            being thought worthy of the same honours. For him, also, <lb/>
            God calls up for the preparation of the sacred furniture and <lb/>
            for the care of the sacred works. But he receives only the <lb/>
            second honour of this summons, and the all-wise Moses <lb/>
            shall have the first place assigned to him. For the former <lb/>
            fashions shadows only, like painters do, in which it is not <lb/>
            right to form any living thing. For the very name Bezeleel <lb/>
            is interpreted to mean, "working in shadows." But Moses <lb/>
            does not make shadows, but the task is assigned to him of <lb/>
            forming the archetypal natures of things themselves. And <lb/>
            in other places, also, the great Cause of all things is accus­ <lb/>
            tomed to reveal his secrets to some in a more conspicuous <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xix. 20. </note><note type="footnote"> t Exodus xxxi. 2 is the passage alluded to, and not any verse in <lb/>
            Leviticus. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="422"/>
            and visible manner, as if in the pure light of the sun, and <lb/>
            to others more sparely, as though in the shade.</p>
          <p>VII. Having therefore gone through all the larger plants <lb/>
            in the universe, let us see in what manner the all-wise God <lb/>
            made the trees which exist in the smaller world, that is to <lb/>
            say, in man. In the first place, then, taking our body as if <lb/>
            it were a field of deep soil, he created the external senses <lb/>
            to be in it as so many channels. And after that, he arranged <lb/>
            the place of each separate one of them, as if it had been a <lb/>
            fruit-bearing and most useful tree, assigning the sense of <lb/>
            hearing to the ear, that of sight to the eyes, that of smell <lb/>
            to the nostrils, and each of the other senses and faculties to <lb/>
            their kindred and appropriate organs. And the divine man <lb/>
            bears his testimony to this account of mine, speaking thus <lb/>
            in his Psalms, " He that planted the ear, doth he not hear ? <lb/>
            and he that made the eyes, shall he not see ? " * Moreover, <lb/>
            all the different powers which run down as far as the legs <lb/>
            and hands, and all the other parts of the body, whether <lb/>
            internal or external, are all those of an unimportant kind. <lb/>
            But those which are better and more perfect he has rooted <lb/>
            in the more central portion; that which is pre-eminently <lb/>
            able to bring forth fruit, the dominant portion of the man. <lb/>
            These faculties are perception, comprehension, felicity of <lb/>
            conjecture, study, memory, habit, disposition, the various <lb/>
            species of art, the firmness of knowledge of different things, <lb/>
            the apprehension of the speculations of universal virtue in <lb/>
            such a way as is never forgotten. Now, no mortal is com­ <lb/>
            petent to plant any one of these things himself. But of all <lb/>
            of them together there is one architect, the uncreated God, <lb/>
            who has not only made them originally, but who also makes <lb/>
            them for and implants them in every individual man that is <lb/>
            born.</p>
          <p>VIII. Now the account of the planting of Paradise is con­ <lb/>
            sistent with what has been already said. For it is stated, <lb/>
            " God planted a Paradise in Eden, towards the east; and <lb/>
            there he placed the man whom he has made." t Now, to <lb/>
            think that it is here meant that God planted vines, or olive <lb/>
            trees, or apple trees, or pomegranates, or any trees of such <lb/>
            kinds, is mere incurable folly. For why should he have <note type="footnote"> * Psalm xciv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ii. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="423"/>
            done so ? any one may ask. Was it that he might have a <lb/>
            pleasant abode to spend his time in ? Even the whole <lb/>
            world could not be considered a dwelling sufficient for God, <lb/>
            the governor of the universe. Would it not appear to be <lb/>
            deficient in innumerable other things, so that it could never <lb/>
            be looked upon as a place worthily suited to the reception of <lb/>
            the great King ? True, indeed, it is impiety to think that <lb/>
            the Cause of all things can be contained in that which he <lb/>
            has caused, especially as even those trees do not invariably <lb/>
            bear their annual fruit.</p>
          <p>For whose enjoyment and use, then, is it that the Paradise <lb/>
            is to produce fruit ? For that of no man. For there is <lb/>
            absolutely no one at all who is represented as inhabiting the <lb/>
            Paradise, since Moses says that God removed the first man <lb/>
            who was created out of the earth, by name Adam, from his <lb/>
            original place, and placed him here. And, moreover, God <lb/>
            has no need of food any more than he has of anything else ; <lb/>
            for it follows necessarily that he who uses food must first of <lb/>
            all stand in need of it. And in the second place, that he <lb/>
            must have organs adapted for the reception of it, by means <lb/>
            of which he can receive it when it enters him ; and then <lb/>
            dismiss it from him when he has digested it. But all these <lb/>
            things, which are parts of the happiness and blessedness which <lb/>
            surround the Great Cause of all things, are inconsistent <lb/>
            with the doctrine of those men who represent him as clothed <lb/>
            with human form, and influenced by human passions to the <lb/>
            utter destruction of all piety and religious feeling-both <lb/>
            great virtues ; such notions being contrary to all law and <lb/>
            right.</p>
          <p>IX. We must therefore have recourse to allegory, which <lb/>
            is a favourite with men capable of seeing through it; for <lb/>
            the sacred oracles most evidently conduct us towards and <lb/>
            instigate us to the pursuit of it. For they say that in the <lb/>
            Paradise there were plants in no respect similar to those <lb/>
            which exist among us; but they speak of trees of life, trees <lb/>
            of immortality, trees of knowledge, of comprehension, of <lb/>
            understanding; trees of the knowledge of good and evil. <lb/>
            Now these cannot have been trees of the land, but must <lb/>
            indisputably have been plants of a rational soil, which was <lb/>
            a road to travel along, leading to virtue, and having for its <lb/>
            end life and immortality; and another road leading to vice, <lb/>
             <pb n="424"/>
            having for its end the loss of life and immortality, that is <lb/>
            to say, death.</p>
          <p>Therefore, we must suppose that the bounteous God <lb/>
            plants in the soul, as it were, a paradise of virtues and of <lb/>
            the actions in accordance with them, which lead it to perfect <lb/>
            happiness. On this account, also, he has assigned a most <lb/>
            appropriate place to the Paradise, called Eden (and the <lb/>
            name Eden, being interpreted, means ".delight"), an emblem <lb/>
            of the soul, which sees right things, and revels amid the <lb/>
            virtues, and exults by reason of the abundance and magni­ <lb/>
            tude of its joy; proposing to itself one source of enjoyment <lb/>
            in the place of the innumerable things which are accounted <lb/>
            pleasant among men, namely the service of the one wise <lb/>
            God. He, then, who had drunk of this unmixed source of <lb/>
            joy, and was a follower of and fellow rejoicer with Moses, <lb/>
            and not one of the least valued of that body, in his Psalms <lb/>
            addressed his own mind, saying, " Delight thou in the <lb/>
            Lord." * Exciting himself and his mind towards heavenly <lb/>
            and divine love by these words, and indignantly turning <lb/>
            away from the luxury and effeminacy existing among what <lb/>
            are called and believed to be human goods; and being <lb/>
            hurried away in his whole heart by divine inspiration and <lb/>
            fervour, and finding his joy in God alone.</p>
          <p>X. And the statement that the Paradise was in the <lb/>
            east," is a proof of what has been here said. For folly is a <lb/>
            thing of darkness and setting, and which brings on the <lb/>
            night; but wisdom is a most brilliant thing, radiant all <lb/>
            around, and in the truest sense of the word, rising. And, <lb/>
            as the sun, when it arises, fills the whole circle of the heaven <lb/>
            with its light, so in the same manner, when the beams of <lb/>
            virtue shine forth, they make the whole place occupied by <lb/>
            the mind full of pure light. Therefore the possessions of <lb/>
            man have guards and keepers, very fierce beasts, for the <lb/>
            repulse of invading and attacking enemies. But the posses­ <lb/>
            sions of God have rational natures for their guards. For <lb/>
            "there," says Moses, "God placed the man whom he had <lb/>
            made;" that is to say, he placed him among the rational <lb/>
            virtues alone ; therefore the practices and uses of the virtues <lb/>
            have received from God this especial honour beyond the <lb/>
            souls of other animals. And therefore, also, it is most <note type="footnote"> * Psalm xxxvii. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="425"/>
            expressly and plainly declared that God placed that man <lb/>
            which is really man in us, namely, the mind, among the <lb/>
            most sacred shoots and plants of excellence and virtue. <lb/>
            But among those animals which have no share in mind, no <lb/>
            one has ever cultivated any plant worth speaking of, since <lb/>
            there is not one of them capable by nature of receiving <lb/>
            comprehension.</p>
          <p>XI. We cannot therefore raise any question as to why it <lb/>
            was ordained that all the different species of animals should <lb/>
            be collected in the ark which was made at the time of the <lb/>
            great deluge, while more were brought into the Paradise. For <lb/>
            the ark was an emblem of the body, which of necessity there­ <lb/>
            fore contained all the most tameable and ferocious evils of <lb/>
            the passions and vices; but the Paradise contained only <lb/>
            the virtues : and the virtues do not receive anything savage <lb/>
            or in short anything destitute of reason. And Moses also <lb/>
            speaks very carefully, not representing the man who was <lb/>
            made after God's own image, but the man who was formed <lb/>
            of clay, as the one who was placed in the paradise. For the <lb/>
            one who was made after the image of God, and stamped with <lb/>
            the truth of God, does, as it appears to me, in no respect <lb/>
            differ from the tree which bore as its fruit everlasting life. <lb/>
            For they are both imperishable, and have both been thought <lb/>
            worthy of the most central position in the dominant part of <lb/>
            man. For it is said that " the tree of life is in the midst of <lb/>
            the Paradise."</p>
          <p>But the other man, he of the composite and more earthly <lb/>
            body, who has no justification in uncreated and simple <lb/>
            nature, the cultivator of which is the only person who knows <lb/>
            how to dwell in the house and in the courts of the Lord. <lb/>
            For Jacob is represented " as a plain man dwelling in a <lb/>
            house," * having a disposition full of ingenuity, and com­ <lb/>
            pounded and made up of all kinds of materials. It was <lb/>
            natural therefore to place and firmly root the mind in the <lb/>
            middle of the paradise, that is, of theuniversal world, having in <lb/>
            itself faculties which draw it in contrary directions, so that <lb/>
            it should be kept in a state of doubt when called upon to <lb/>
            discriminate as to what it should choose and what it should <lb/>
            avoid, since if it chose the better part it would reap immor­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxv. 27, where the expression, however, is "dwelling in <lb/>
            tents." </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="426"/>
            tality and glory; and if it chose the worse it would meet <lb/>
            with reproach and death.</p>
          <p>XII. Such then are the trees which the only wise God <lb/>
            has planted in rational souls. But Moses, pitying those who <lb/>
            were exiled and compelled to quit the paradise of the virtues, <lb/>
            addresses a prayer to the absolute authority of God and to <lb/>
            his merciful and propitious powers, entreating that in the <lb/>
            place from which the earthly mind, Adam, was banished, there <lb/>
            a people capable of seeing the truth might be planted. For <lb/>
            he says, " Bring them in and plant them in the mountain of <lb/>
            thy inheritance which thou dost give them; thou hast made <lb/>
            them to sit in thy seat, 0 Lord; in the sanctuary, 0 Lord, <lb/>
            which thy hands have made. The Lord shall shall be king of <lb/>
            ages, for ever and ever." *</p>
          <p>Therefore he had learnt, as plainly as any man that ever <lb/>
            lived, that God, having fixed the roots and seeds of every­ <lb/>
            thing down in the earth, is the cause also of the greatest of <lb/>
            all plants, namelythis world, shooting up; which world he here <lb/>
            seems to speak of enigmatically in the song which I have <lb/>
            just quoted, where he calls it the mountain of his inheritance ; <lb/>
            since that which is made is the most appropriate possession and <lb/>
            inheritance, of him who has made it. Therefore he prays that we <lb/>
            may be planted in it, not in order that we may become irrational <lb/>
            and unmanageable in our natures ; but that, in due obedience <lb/>
            to the arrangement of the all-perfect governor, imitating <lb/>
            his perpetual and undeviating consistency, we may live a <lb/>
            temperate and innocent life. For to be able to live in a <lb/>
            strict uniformity with nature, is what the men of old have <lb/>
            defined as the end of happiness.</p>
          <p>And accordingly what is said afterwards is in strict agree­ <lb/>
            ment with what is said before, namely, that the world is the <lb/>
            beautiful and properly prepared house of God, appreciable <lb/>
            by the external senses ; and that he himself made it and <lb/>
            that it is not uncreated, as some persons have thought. And <lb/>
            lie uses the word "sanctuary," as meaning a splendour <lb/>
            emitted from holy objects, an imitation of the archetypal <lb/>
            model; since those things which are beautiful to the <lb/>
            external senses are to the intellectual senses models of what <lb/>
            is beautiful.</p>
          <p>The expression that "it was prepared by the hands of God," <lb/>
            means that it was made by his world-creating powers. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xv. 17. </note> <pb n="427"/>
            </p>
          <p>But in order that no one may suppose that the Creator had <lb/>
            need of any one of the things which he created, he adds the <lb/>
            most necessary assertion, " Being King of ages for ever and <lb/>
            ever." But a king is in need of nothing, but everything <lb/>
            which is subject to him is inevitably in need of the king. <lb/>
            And some persons have said that God is and is properly <lb/>
            called the inheritance of God, the use and enjoyment of <lb/>
            which Moses has now prayed may be afforded to us. For, <lb/>
            says he, representing us as children just beginning to learn by <lb/>
            means of the doctrines and speculations of wisdom, and not <lb/>
            leaving us destitute of the elements of knowledge, plant them in <lb/>
            sublime and heavenly reason. For this is the most thoroughly <lb/>
            prepared inheritance; the house most completely ready, the <lb/>
            abode most entirely suitable, which "thou hast made holy." <lb/>
            For, 0 master, thou art the maker of all good and holy things, <lb/>
            as, on the other hand, corruptible creation is of what is evil and <lb/>
            profane. Reign thou throughout infinite eternity over the <lb/>
            suppliant soul; not leaving it for a single moment without <lb/>
            a governor. For an uninterrupted service under them is not <lb/>
            only better than freedom, but even than the most extensive <lb/>
            dominion.</p>
          <p>XIII. In many people perhaps an inquiry may suggest <lb/>
            itself as to what is the meaning of the expression, " In the <lb/>
            mountain of thy inheritance." It is plain that God bestows <lb/>
            inheritance, but perhaps it is not reasonable to think that he <lb/>
            receives inheritances, since everything in the world belongs to <lb/>
            him. But perhaps this is said of those who are subject to <lb/>
            him as their master, according to some special computation <lb/>
            of connection ; just as kings govern indeed all their subjects, <lb/>
            but rule their own servants in a different and peculiar manner, <lb/>
            whom they are accustomed to employ as ministers for the <lb/>
            care of their bodies and the rest of their manner of life. And <lb/>
            again, though they are lords of all the possessions in their <lb/>
            whole country, even of those which appear to belong to pri­ <lb/>
            vate individuals, they nevertheless are accounted owners only <lb/>
            of those portions which they can entrust to superintendents <lb/>
            and overseers, from whom they receive yearly revenues, <lb/>
            which properties they often visit for the sake of relaxation <lb/>
            and amusement, when they lay aside for a while the <lb/>
            heaviest portion of the burden of the cares which arise to <lb/>
            them in the administration of public affairs and in the govern­ <lb/>
             <pb n="428"/>
            merit of their kingdoms; and these possessions are called <lb/>
            especially the royal properties.</p>
          <p>Moreover all the silver and gold, and other treasures which <lb/>
            are stored up in the coffers of their subjects, do all in reality <lb/>
            belong more to the rulers than to those who possess them. <lb/>
            But nevertheless there are some which are peculiarly called <lb/>
            the royal treasures, in which those who are appointed col­ <lb/>
            lectors of the produce lay up the revenues which are derived <lb/>
            from the country. Do not wonder, therefore, if the com­ <lb/>
            pany of wise souls is pronounced to be the especial inheritance <lb/>
            of the all-powerful God who has authority and dominion <lb/>
            over everything, since he sees most acutely of all beings, <lb/>
            exercising the irreproachable and unadulterated eye of the <lb/>
            mind, which is never shut, but is always wide open and <lb/>
            looking intensely into every thing.</p>
          <p>XIV. And on this account, indeed, it is said in the greater <lb/>
            prayer, " Inquire of thy father, and he will tell thee ; of thy <lb/>
            elders, and they will reply to thee, when the Most High <lb/>
            divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he <lb/>
            fixed the boundaries of the nations, according to the number <lb/>
            of the angels of God, and the portion of the Lord himself <lb/>
            was his people Israel."* For, behold, here again, he uses <lb/>
            the expression, " the portion and inheritance of God," mean­ <lb/>
            ing that disposition which is capable of seeing him, and which <lb/>
            sincerely worships him ; and he says that the children of the <lb/>
            earth, whom he calls the sons of Adam, were scattered and <lb/>
            dispersed, and brought together again, and that a company <lb/>
            was formed of them, since they were unable to use right <lb/>
            reason as their guide. For, in real truth, virtue is the cause <lb/>
            of harmony and unity, and the opposite disposition is the <lb/>
            cause of dissolution and disagreement. Indeed, it is a proof <lb/>
            of what has been said,, what happens every year on the day <lb/>
            called the day of atonement; for on that day the people are <lb/>
            enjoined " to take by lot two goats, one for the Lord, and <lb/>
            one to be the scapegoat ;"t that is to say, two reasons, the <lb/>
            one in accordance with God, the other consistent with crea­ <lb/>
            tion. He, therefore, who wishes to exalt the Cause of all <lb/>
            things will acquire honour to himself; but he who attributes <lb/>
            honour to creation will be banished, being driven from the <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xv. 6. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="429"/>
            most sacred places, and compelled to fall into inaccessible <lb/>
            and wicked gulfs.</p>
          <p>XV. Moses, therefore, has such intimate connection with <lb/>
            God, that, relying upon this in a very great degree, he is in <lb/>
            the habit of using more fervent and energetic expressions <lb/>
            and doctrines than are calculated for the ears of us inferior <lb/>
            persons; for he not only thinks it fit to speak of God as an <lb/>
            inheritor, but even, which is a more startling thing to the <lb/>
            comprehension, he calls him the inheritance of others ; for <lb/>
            to the entire tribe which came to him as a fugitive and a sup­ <lb/>
            pliant, he did not think fit to allot only a portion of land, as he <lb/>
            did to the other eleven tribes, but he chose that they should <lb/>
            receive an especial honour, namely, the priesthood, a posses­ <lb/>
            sion not of earth, but of heaven. "For thou shalt not be," <lb/>
            says God, as Moses represents, "a portion to the tribe of Levi, <lb/>
            nor any inheritance among the children of Israel, because <lb/>
            the Lord himself is their inheritance.”* And again he speaks <lb/>
            in the person of God, in his holy oracles, in this manner: <lb/>
            " I am thy portion and inheritance."t For, in real truth, <lb/>
            the mind which is perfectly purified, and which knows all <lb/>
            the things of creation, knows and recognizes one only God, <lb/>
            the Uncreate, whom it approaches, and by whom it is re­ <lb/>
            ceived. For to whom is it permitted to say, " He alone is <lb/>
            my God," except to the man who is attached to none of the <lb/>
            objects which are inferior to him ? And this is the custom <lb/>
            of the Levites ; for the name of Levi, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means, " he is to me," because different things are honoured <lb/>
            by different people, but by him only that which is highest <lb/>
            and most excellent, the Cause of all things.</p>
          <p>XVI. They tell an old story, that some man in ancient <lb/>
            times, who had fallen madly in love with the beauty of wis­ <lb/>
            dom, as if it had been the beauty of a most lovely woman, <lb/>
            once, when he saw a most sumptuous preparation of un­ <lb/>
            bounded and costly magnificence, looked towards some of <lb/>
            his friends, and said, " Behold, 0 companions, how many <lb/>
            things there are of which I have no need!" And yet he <lb/>
            had nothing whatever of even necessary things beyond his <lb/>
            mere clothes, so that he was not puffed up with the magni­ <lb/>
            tude of his riches, which has been the case with numbers of <note type="footnote"> f Deuteronomy x. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xviii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="430"/>
            people; so that, on this account, he spoke arrogantly against <lb/>
            pomp and show.</p>
          <p>The lawgiver teaches us that we should account those <lb/>
            people wise who are not eager to be rich in created things, <lb/>
            but who despise all created things in comparison of the <lb/>
            friendship of the uncreated God, whom they look upon as <lb/>
            the only true wealth, and the boundary of most perfect <lb/>
            happiness. Never, then, let those men boast, who have <lb/>
            acquired power and sovereignty, as some do, because they <lb/>
            have subdued one city, or country, or nation; and others, <lb/>
            because they have acquired the dominion over all the coun­ <lb/>
            tries of the earth, to its furthest borders, and over all Gre­ <lb/>
            cian and barbarous nations, and over all the rivers and seas, <lb/>
            infinite both in number and magnitude. For if, besides <lb/>
            these things, they had made themselves masters (which it is <lb/>
            impious even to mention) of that sublime nature which was <lb/>
            the only thing that the Creator made free from the bond of <lb/>
            slavery and servitude, they would still be looked upon but <lb/>
            as private individuals in comparison with the great kings <lb/>
            who have received God for their inheritance; for in pro­ <lb/>
            portion as that nature which has acquired a possession is <lb/>
            better than the possession itself, and the Creator than the <lb/>
            thing created, by so much also are they more royal.</p>
          <p>XVII. Therefore, some people considered, that they who <lb/>
            said that everything was the property of the one good Being, <lb/>
            were speaking in an unreasonable manner, looking at the <lb/>
            deficiencies and abundance which existed externally, and <lb/>
            thinking no one rich who was in want of either money or <lb/>
            possessions. But Moses thinks wisdom a thing of such <lb/>
            pre-eminent value, and deserving to be so eagerly sought <lb/>
            after, that not only the whole world deserves to be his <lb/>
            inheritance, but that he even looks upon the Governor of <lb/>
            the universe in that light; and these are the doctrines, not <lb/>
            of men who are halting between two opinions, but of those <lb/>
            who are occupied in a firm and sure faith; since, even <lb/>
            now, there are some persons among those who make a show <lb/>
            and pretence of piety, who calumniate the literal meaning of <lb/>
            this saying, saying that it is neither pious nor safe to speak <lb/>
            of God as the inheritance of a man. You say this—I should <lb/>
            say to them-because ye have come not from genuine <lb/>
            passion, but from a supposititious and illegitimate one, to <lb/>
             <pb n="431"/>
            the investigation of things. For you thought it a matter of <lb/>
            equal consequence for God to be called the inheritance of <lb/>
            possessions, of vineyards, and oliveyards, and such matters, <lb/>
            and of wise men; and ye did not perceive that paintings are <lb/>
            said to be the inheritance of painters, and, in short, that any <lb/>
            art is said to be the inheritance of the artist, not looked at <lb/>
            as an earthly possession, but as a heavenly prize ; for none <lb/>
            of such things are the property of any master, but still they <lb/>
            are an advantage to those who possess them : so that you, <lb/>
            O sycophants, hear of the living God as an inheritance, not <lb/>
            in the sense of being a possession, like those which I have <lb/>
            enumerated, but as being the most beneficial and greatest <lb/>
            of goods to those who think fit to worship the Cause of <lb/>
            all good.</p>
          <p>XVIII. Having, therefore, now said what is proper con­ <lb/>
            cerning the original planter and the original plant, let us <lb/>
            next proceed, in due order, to the consideration of matters <lb/>
            of instruction and imitation.</p>
          <p>In the first place, then, the wise Abraham is said " to have <lb/>
            planted a field at the well of the oath, and to have called upon <lb/>
            the name of the everlasting Lord God.”* And here there <lb/>
            is no peculiar property of the plants mentioned, but only <lb/>
            the magnitude of the place. And they who are in the habit <lb/>
            of investigating these matters say, that everything which <lb/>
            belongs to God has been very carefully and accurately <lb/>
            described, both tree and place, and the fruit of the tree. <lb/>
            Accordingly, they say that the tree was the field itself, not <lb/>
            like those trees which sprung up out of the ground, but <lb/>
            rather to those which grow according to the firmly-rooted <lb/>
            mind of the man who loves God: and the place, they say, <lb/>
            is the well of the oath, and the fruit, the change of the name <lb/>
            of the Lord into that of " The Eternal God."</p>
          <p>And it is necessary further to give the probable explana­ <lb/>
            tion of each point of the things here mentioned. The field, <lb/>
            then, being in length a hundred cubits, and as many in <lb/>
            breadth, multiplied together according to the nature and <lb/>
            character of a square, is composed of ten thousand superficial <lb/>
            cubits ; and this is the greatest limit of those numbers which <lb/>
            increase from the unit, and also the most perfect: so that the <lb/>
            limit is the beginning of numbers, and the end, in those calcu­ <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="432"/>
            lations, according to the first combination, is the number ten <lb/>
            thousand; in reference to which fact, some persons have not <lb/>
            erred greatly, who have compared the limit to the starting- <lb/>
            place, and the number ten thousand to the goal, and all the <lb/>
            numbers between these two to those who contend in a race; <lb/>
            for they, beginning to start from the unit, as from the start­ <lb/>
            ing place, come to the number ten thousand as to the goal. <lb/>
            Therefore, some persons, departing from these numbers, as <lb/>
            from signals, have said that God is the beginning and end <lb/>
            of everything, which is a doctrine admirably calculated to <lb/>
            engender piety. This doctrine, being implanted in the soul, <lb/>
            produces a most beautiful and nutritious fruit, holiness ; and <lb/>
            the place most suitable for this fruit, is the well which is <lb/>
            called the oath, in which there is a report that no water <lb/>
            could be found. For, says Moses, " the children of Israel, <lb/>
            coming thither, reported to him concerning the well which <lb/>
            they had digged : and they said, We found no water ; and he <lb/>
            called that place, " The Oath."* Let us now consider what <lb/>
            is the meaning of this statement.</p>
          <p>XIX. Those who investigate the nature of things as they <lb/>
            actually exist, and who conduct their examinations of each <lb/>
            individual matter in no negligent manner, behave very like <lb/>
            those men who dig wells ; for they also are seeking springs <lb/>
            in an obscure place. And all men have one common desire, <lb/>
            to find something to drink. But some men's nature is to <lb/>
            be nourished by the food of the soul, and that of others by <lb/>
            the food of the body. As, therefore, some of those who <lb/>
            have dug wells have often done so without finding water; <lb/>
            so likewise those who advance far in knowledge, and who <lb/>
            have made great progress in it, are still often unable to attain <lb/>
            to the end which they desire. At all events, they say that <lb/>
            men of extensive learning often find fault with their terrible <lb/>
            ignorance, for they only just know how far they are removed <lb/>
            from the truth. And there is a story that some man of old <lb/>
            time, when he was admired for his wisdom, said, that it was <lb/>
            a fine thing that he should be admired, who only just knew <lb/>
            that he knows nothing.</p>
          <p>And choose, if you like, any art you please, whether <lb/>
            trifling or important, and the man, too, who is most excel­ <lb/>
            lent, and most highly thought of in regard of his skill in it, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvi. 32. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="433"/>
            and then consider if the professions held out by the art are <lb/>
            equal to the performances of the artist; for if you duly <lb/>
            examine the matter, you will find that the performance falls <lb/>
            short of the profession, not by a small, but by a vast dis­ <lb/>
            tance, it being almost impossible for a man to be perfect in <lb/>
            any art whatever, which is in continual motion like a fount­ <lb/>
            ain, and is constantly pouring forth various species of all <lb/>
            kinds of speculations. On this account, it is most appro­ <lb/>
            priately denominated an <unclear>oath</unclear>,9 being the most certain sign <lb/>
            of faith, comprehending also the testimony of God: for as <lb/>
            he who swears, calls God to be a witness to a matter <lb/>
            concerning which a question is raised, so it is not possible <lb/>
            to swear so truly about any matter, as to the fact that the <lb/>
            perfection of no art whatever can be found in the artist who <lb/>
            professes it.</p>
          <p>And the same assertion holds good also with respect to <lb/>
            all the other powers which exist in us, or very nearly so; <lb/>
            for, as they say, that no water was found in the well which <lb/>
            had been mentioned, so also neither was there the faculty of <lb/>
            seeing in the eyes, or that of hearing in the ears, or that of <lb/>
            smelling in the nostrils, or, in short, any one of the senses <lb/>
            in its corresponding organ; and similarly in the mind, <lb/>
            there was not the faculty of comprehension. For how <lb/>
            could it have happened that any one should have made a <lb/>
            mistake in what he saw, or in what he heard, or in what he <lb/>
            understood, if the comprehensions of each of these faculties <lb/>
            had been well established, and if they had had a trustworthy <lb/>
            nature of themselves without God implanting accuracy in <lb/>
            them ?</p>
          <p>XX. Having now, therefore, discussed the place suf­ <lb/>
            ficiently in which the tree flourishes, let us now, in con­ <lb/>
            clusion, examine also the subject of the fruit :- <lb/>
            Now, what the fruit is, Moses will tell us himself: "For <lb/>
            the Lord God everlasting," says he, " called it by its <lb/>
            name.”* Therefore the appellations already mentioned reveal <lb/>
            the powers existing in the living God; for one title is that <lb/>
            of Lord, according to which he governs; and the other is <lb/>
            God, according to which he is beneficent. For which <lb/>
            reason also, in the account of the creation of the world, <lb/>
            according to the most holy Moses, the name of God is <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxL 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> F F </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="434"/>
            always assumed by him: for it was fitting that the power <lb/>
            according to which the Creator, when he was bringing his <lb/>
            creatures into the world, arranged and adorned them, should <lb/>
            be invoked also by that creation. Inasmuch, therefore, as <lb/>
            he is a ruler, he has both powers, that, namely, of doing <lb/>
            good, and that of doing harm ; regulating his conduct oil <lb/>
            the principle of requiting him who has done anything. But <lb/>
            inasmuch as he is a benefactor, he is inclined only to one <lb/>
            of these two courses, namely, to do good. And it would be <lb/>
            the greatest possible advantage to the soul no longer to feel <lb/>
            any doubt about the power of the king for both purposes, <lb/>
            but steadily to emancipate itself from the fear, which is <lb/>
            suspended over it, on account of the vastness of his autho­ <lb/>
            rity, and to kindle and keep alive a most firm hope of the <lb/>
            acquisition and enjoyment of blessings arising from his <lb/>
            being beneficent by deliberate intention.</p>
          <p>Now the expression, "everlasting God," is equivalent to, <lb/>
            God who bestows gifts, not sometimes giving and some­ <lb/>
            times not, but always and incessantly; it is equivalent to, <lb/>
            God who does good uninterruptedly; to God who, without <lb/>
            intermission, is connecting a flow of benefits, coming one <lb/>
            after the other; God, who pours forth blessings upon bless­ <lb/>
            ings, who is made up of mercies connected and united ; God, <lb/>
            who never omits any single opportunity of doing good; God, <lb/>
            who is also the Lord, so that he is able to injure.</p>
          <p>XXI. This also Jacob, the practiser of virtue, asked at <lb/>
            the end of his most holy prayers. For he said, “ And the <lb/>
            Lord shall be to me as God." Which is equivalent to: <lb/>
            He will no longer display towards me the despotic power of <lb/>
            his absolute authority, but rather the beneficent influence of <lb/>
            his universally propitious and saving power, utterly removing <lb/>
            the fear with which he is regarded as a master, and filling <lb/>
            the soul with affection and benevolence as felt towards a <lb/>
            benefactor. What soul could ever conceive thus that the <lb/>
            master and ruler of the universe, without changing anything <lb/>
            of his own nature, but remaining in the condition in which <lb/>
            he always was, is continually kind and uninterruptedly <lb/>
            bounteous ? owing to which he is, to those who are happy, <lb/>
            the most perfect cause of unlimited and overflowing bless­ <lb/>
            ings. And to trust in a king who is not by reason of the <lb/>
            magnitude of his authority elated so as to do injury to his <lb/>
             <pb n="435"/>
            subjects, but who, through his love to mankind, prefers that <lb/>
            every one should enjoy happiness without fear, is the <lb/>
            greatest possible bulwark of prosperity and security.</p>
          <p>XXII. What, therefore, we originally undertook we <lb/>
            have now nearly fulfilled, namely, to demonstrate that the <lb/>
            fact spoken of must be taken to mean the principle which <lb/>
            declares God to be the most glorious of all things. The <lb/>
            portion of the subject which follows next, is the demon­ <lb/>
            stration that perfection is found in no created thing, but <lb/>
            that it does appear in them at times owing to the grace of <lb/>
            the great Cause of all things. And the fruit of the tree is, <lb/>
            that the graces of God endure for ever and ever, and that <lb/>
            they are shed incessantly upon mankind, and never cease. <lb/>
            Thus, in truth, the wise man, following the practice of the <lb/>
            first and greatest planter, displays his knowledge of hus­ <lb/>
            bandry ; and the sacred scripture wishes the labours of <lb/>
            husbandry to be performed, even by those of us who are not <lb/>
            yet perfect, but who are still reckoned among the middle <lb/>
            numbers of those things which are accounted duties ; for <lb/>
            it says, " When you go forth into the land which the Lord <lb/>
            your God giveth to you, and when you plant every tree <lb/>
            which is good for food, you shall completely purify its un­ <lb/>
            cleanness. For three years it shall be unclean as to its fruit, <lb/>
            it shall not be eaten; but in the fourth year, all its fruit <lb/>
            shall be holy, being praised by the Lord. And in tile fifth <lb/>
            year you shall eat the fruit thereof; and everything that <lb/>
            it bears shall be useful to you : I am the Lord your God."* <lb/>
            Therefore it was impossible for the children of Israel, to <lb/>
            plant those trees which are eatable, before they arrived in <lb/>
            the country which had been given them by God: for he <lb/>
            says, " When you go forth into the land, .... and when <lb/>
            you plant every' tree which is good for food." So that <lb/>
            while we are outside of the promised land, we should not be <lb/>
            able to cultivate such trees ; and this is very natural; for as <lb/>
            long as the mind has not entered upon the path of wisdom, <lb/>
            but turns aside and wanders out of the road, it cares only <lb/>
            for the trees which do not admit of being cultivated or used <lb/>
            for food of men,—trees which are barren and useless, and <lb/>
            which, though they bear, bear no fruit which is eatable. <lb/>
            But when the mind, having entered upon the path of <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> F iF 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="436"/>
            wisdom, marches along with its doctrines, and begins to <lb/>
            keep pace with them all, it then cultivates the useful trees, <lb/>
            which are capable of bearing eatable fruit, instead of caring <lb/>
            for those useless kinds ; it cultivates a mastery over, instead <lb/>
            of the indulgence of the passions, and knowledge instead of <lb/>
            ignorance, and good instead of evil.</p>
          <p>Since therefore he who is led into the path of virtue is <lb/>
            still at a long distance from the end, it is very naturally laid <lb/>
            as an injunction upon the man who plants, to remove the <lb/>
            un cleanness of that which is planted. And what this is, we <lb/>
            will now consider.</p>
          <p>XXIII. These duties which are as it were in the middle, <lb/>
            appear to me to be properly looked upon in the same light <lb/>
            as those trees, which admit of being cultivated and used for <lb/>
            food ; for each of them bears most useful fruits, the one for <lb/>
            the body, and the other for the soul. But in the middle <lb/>
            there must necessarily be many injurious plants springing <lb/>
            up with and growing along-side of them, which must be <lb/>
            removed in order that the better sorts may not be injured. <lb/>
            May I not call the restoration of a deposit a useful plant of <lb/>
            the soul ? But still this plant requires purification and <lb/>
            exceeding attention. What then is the purification ? <lb/>
            This. Having taken a deposit from a man while he is <lb/>
            sober, you must not restore it to him while he is drunk, or <lb/>
            intemperate, or mad ; for in such a case though he may <lb/>
            have received the advantage of having his own back again, <lb/>
            he will have no opportunity of being benefited by it. <lb/>
            Again. You must not restore a deposit to debtors or to <lb/>
            slaves while their creditors or their masters are present; <lb/>
            for that is betraying, and not a restoration of a deposit. <lb/>
            Nor must you keep faith in small things in the hope <lb/>
            merely of gaining confidence, so as to have greater things <lb/>
            entrusted to you. For those who fish, and who let down <lb/>
            small baits into the sea, with the view of catching larger <lb/>
            fish, are not very much to be blamed, as they say that they are <lb/>
            providing for the good supply of the market, and in order <lb/>
            that they may supply men with unlimited food for every <lb/>
            day. But no one should use as a bait, the restoration of a <lb/>
            deposit of small value by way of obtaining a larger one, <lb/>
            holding forth in his hands, and displaying the deposit of <lb/>
            one individual, and that a trifling one, and in his intention <lb/>
             <pb n="437"/>
            appropriating the deposits of every body, and those too of un­ <lb/>
            speakable value. If, therefore, you remove the uncleanness <lb/>
            of your deposit, as of these trees, namely, the inquiries <lb/>
            threatened by plotters, the evils arising from want of <lb/>
            opportunity and treachery, and all things of similar kinds; <lb/>
            you will bring into a state of cultivation and usefulness, <lb/>
            that which was on the point of becoming wild.</p>
          <p>XXIV. And in the case of the tree of friendship, it is <lb/>
            necessary to cut down and eradicate these things which <lb/>
            shoot up by the side of it for the sake of preserving the <lb/>
            more valuable plant. And the evil plants which spring up <lb/>
            along-side are these : the tricky blandishments of courtesans <lb/>
            towards their lovers, and the deceitfulness of parasites to <lb/>
            those whom they flatter. For one may see those who <lb/>
            make a traffic of their personal beauty, clinging to their <lb/>
            lovers as if they were excessively fond of them ; but they <lb/>
            love not them but themselves, and they are eager only for <lb/>
            their daily gains. And as for flatterers, sometimes they <lb/>
            conceal unspeakable hatred towards those whom they <lb/>
            flatter; but still, being slaves to gluttony and intemperance, <lb/>
            they are on that account induced to pay court to those who <lb/>
            can supply their immoderate appetites. But the tree of <lb/>
            science and unadulterated friendship having rejected and <lb/>
            discarded these things, will bear fruit of the greatest <lb/>
            possible service to those who use it, namely, incorruptible <lb/>
            good faith. For good-will is a desire that one's neighbour <lb/>
            should enjoy good things for his own sake. But courtesans <lb/>
            and flatterers are anxious solely for their own advantage, <lb/>
            which is the only motive why they should confer pleasure, <lb/>
            the first on their lovers, and the latter on the objects of <lb/>
            their flatteries. We must therefore cut down all trickeries <lb/>
            and flatteries as evil plants growing up near the tree of <lb/>
            friendship.</p>
          <p>XXV. The due attention to sacred rites, and good faith <lb/>
            in the matter of sacrifices, are the most excellent of trees ; <lb/>
            but along-side of them an evil grows up, namely, superstition, <lb/>
            which it is desirable to eradicate before it has time to <lb/>
            blossom. For some persons have fancied the sacrificing of <lb/>
            oxen to be piety, and they assign a portion of all that they <lb/>
            steal or obtain by denials, or by cheating their creditors, or <lb/>
            by plundering, to the altars. Impious wretches that they <lb/>
             <pb n="438"/>
            are; thinking that thus they are paying a price to buy <lb/>
            themselves off from suffering punishment for their offences. <lb/>
            But to such persons I would say, 0 ye men, the tribunal <lb/>
            of God is not to be corrupted by bribes ; so that those who <lb/>
            have guilty minds will be rejected, even if they sacrifice a <lb/>
            hundred oxen every day ; and those who are innocent will <lb/>
            be received, even if they never sacrifice at all. For God <lb/>
            delights in altars on which no fire is burned, but which are <lb/>
            frequented by virtues, and which do not blaze with great <lb/>
            flame, such as those sacrifices do kindle which are offered by <lb/>
            impious men, and which are no sacrifices at all, and which <lb/>
            serve to remind one of the ignorances and wickedness of <lb/>
            each of the sacrificers ; for Moses has somewhere spoken <lb/>
            of a sacrifice " reminding one of sin."*</p>
          <p>All such things therefore, being the causes of great injury, <lb/>
            it is necessary to cut oft' and eradicate, in obedience to the <lb/>
            oracle in which it is enjoined " to remove the <unclear>uncleanness</unclear> <lb/>
            of the tree which has been planted, bearing eatable fruit.”†</p>
          <p>XXVI. But we, even after we have been instructed, <lb/>
            make no progress in learning; but some persons, having a <lb/>
            self-taught natural instinct, purify what is good from the <lb/>
            evils which surround it, as Jacob did, he who was surnamed <lb/>
            the practicer of virtue ; for he “peeled the rods, leaving on <lb/>
            the white bark, having stripped off all the green ;”‡ in <lb/>
            order that the dark and dusky vanity in the middle being <lb/>
            taken away in every case, a white appearance might be dis­ <lb/>
            played, which should be produced so as to be akin to it, not <lb/>
            by diversified art but by nature ; in reference to which it is <lb/>
            also commanded in the low which was established in cases <lb/>
            of leprosy, that the man who was not infected with any <lb/>
            variation of colour, but who was white all over from the <lb/>
            head to the extremity of his feet, should be pure.”§ In order <lb/>
            that, according to the similitude of the body, those who have <lb/>
            discarded the crafty, and unscrupulous, and ambiguous, and <lb/>
            uncertain disposition of mind, may embrace the simple, <lb/>
            uncoloured, unambiguous, plain complexion of truth; there­ <lb/>
            fore, to say that the tree is purified, contains a principle, the <lb/>
            assertion of which is founded surely in truth, but to make <lb/>
            the same statement with respect to the fruit is saying what <note type="footnote"> * Numbers v. 15. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xix. 23. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxx. 37. </note> <note type="footnote"> § Lcviticus xiii. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="439"/>
            is not equally clear or credible; for no cultivator of figs or <lb/>
            grapes, or, in sort, of any fruit whatever, purifies them.</p>
          <p>XXVII. And again Moses says, " Its fruit shall be <lb/>
            impure for three days, it shall not be eaten;"* as if in <lb/>
            fact it were customary for it to be purified for ever. We <lb/>
            must, therefore, say that this is one of those expressions <lb/>
            which have a concealed meaning, since the words themselves <lb/>
            are not quite consistent with it; for the expression is an <lb/>
            ambiguous one; for it bears one sense of this kind, the fruit <lb/>
            shall remain for three years ; and then there is a distinct <lb/>
            injunction, "it shall not be eaten before it is purified." But <lb/>
            there is also another meaning, " the fruit of the tree shall <lb/>
            for three years be unpurified, and while in that state it shall <lb/>
            not be eaten." According, then, to the former statement <lb/>
            one may understand it in this manner: the three years being <lb/>
            taken for time which is divided into three portions; for it is <lb/>
            the nature of time to be divided into the past, the present, <lb/>
            and the future ; therefore the fruit of education will exist, <lb/>
            and will endure, and will last unimpaired through all the <lb/>
            divisions of time, a statement equivalent to-it will never <lb/>
            receive any corruption, for the nature of good is imperishable.</p>
          <p>But the fruit which is not purified shall not be eaten; <lb/>
            inasmuch as virtuous reasons, duly purified and rendered <lb/>
            sound, nourish the soul, and give vigour to the mind; but <lb/>
            the opposite kinds are not nutritious, but bring disease and <lb/>
            destruction on the soul.</p>
          <p>According to the other meaning, as in the disputes of <lb/>
            dialecticians, the word “undemonstrated” is used in a <lb/>
            double sense, either of a proposition which it is hard to <lb/>
            demonstrate by reason of its difficulty, or of one which is <lb/>
            intrinsically so plain as to require no demonstration, and <lb/>
            the truth of which is established not by the testimony of <lb/>
            any one else, but by its own internal evidence. So also <lb/>
            fruit may be understood as not being purified, either when <lb/>
            it is so impure as to be difficult to purify, or when it <lb/>
            requires no purification, but is bright, and clear, and pure <lb/>
            of itself.</p>
          <p>Such now is the fruit of education; being for three years, <lb/>
            that is to say for all time, divided as it is into three portions, <lb/>
            most completely pure and brilliant, being overshadowed by <lb/>
            no injurious thing, and having no need whatever of any <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="440"/>
            washings or purifications, or any thing else whatever which <lb/>
            tends to cleansing.</p>
          <p>XXVIII. " But in the fourth year," says the scripture, <lb/>
            " all the fruit of the tree shall be sacred, being praised by <lb/>
            the Lord."* The prophetic books appear often to dignity <lb/>
            the number four in many places of the exposition of the law, <lb/>
            and most especially in the account of the creation of the <lb/>
            universe; for the light which is perceptible by the outward <lb/>
            senses, and held in honour, being that which throws the <lb/>
            most brilliant light both upon itself and upon other things, <lb/>
            and upon its own parents the sun and the moon, and upon <lb/>
            the most sacred company of the stars, which by their rising <lb/>
            and setting fix the boundaries of night and day, and, more­ <lb/>
            over, of months and years, and which have shown the nature <lb/>
            of number, to which, also, the greatest good of the soul is <lb/>
            attributed, Moses says was created on the fourth day. And <lb/>
            now he honours this day in a remarkable degree, assigning <lb/>
            the fruit of the trees to God, in accordance with no other <lb/>
            time than with the fourth year after they are planted; for <lb/>
            this has a principle in it very consistent with nature and <lb/>
            with good morals.</p>
          <p>At all events it so happens that the roots of the universe, <lb/>
            the elements of which the world is composed, are four— <lb/>
            earth, water, air, and fire. Also, that the seasons of the <lb/>
            year are equal in number, namely, winter and summer, and <lb/>
            those others which are between these two, spring and <lb/>
            autumn. And as this is the most ancient of all square <lb/>
            numbers, it is found to exist in right angles, as the figure <lb/>
            of a square in geometry shows. And right angles are <lb/>
            manifest examples of correctness of reason. And right <lb/>
            reason is an everlasting fountain of virtues. It follows, <lb/>
            therefore, of necessity that the sides of a square must be all <lb/>
            equal to one another. And equality is the parent of justice, <lb/>
            which is the mistress and ruler of all the virtues, so that it <lb/>
            is now proved that this number four is the symbol of <lb/>
            equality, and justice, and of all virtue, beyond any other <lb/>
            number. And the number four is likewise called “all,” <lb/>
            because it comprehends in its power the numbers up to ten, <lb/>
            and the number ten itself.</p>
          <p>XXIX. That it comprehends all the numbers up to <lb/>
            itself is manifest to every one ; but that it also comprehends <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus xix. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="441"/>
            the numbers which come after it, is very easily seen by a <lb/>
            calculation of numbers, when we have put them together, <lb/>
            one, two, three, four, we shall find what we were doubting <lb/>
            about; for of one and four, the number five will be found to <lb/>
            be composed, and of two and four six are made up; the <lb/>
            number seven, again, consists of three and four; again, <lb/>
            according to a triple combination of one, and three, and <lb/>
            four, the number eight is composed; also of two, and three, <lb/>
            and four, the number nine ; and the number ten is made of <lb/>
            all the numbers together, for one, and two, and three, and <lb/>
            four make ten. On this account also, Moses said that in <lb/>
            the fourth year all the fruit of the tree shall be holy; for <lb/>
            this number has an even, and an entire, and a full, and (as <lb/>
            one may almost say) every possible reason in it, because the <lb/>
            number ten, of which four is the parent, is the first starting <lb/>
            place of all the numbers when put together after the unit; <lb/>
            and the number four and the number ten are both also <lb/>
            called all," but the number ten is so called by reason of its <lb/>
            operation, this number four with reference to its potentiality.</p>
          <p>XXX. And Moses very appropriately says that the fruit <lb/>
            of education is not only holy but also praised; for every <lb/>
            one of the virtues is a holy thing, but most especially is <lb/>
            gratitude holy; but it is impossible to show gratitude to <lb/>
            God in a genuine manner, by those means which people in <lb/>
            general think the only ones, namely offerings and sacrifices ; <lb/>
            for the whole world could not be a temple worthy to be <lb/>
            raised to his honour, except by means of praises and hymns, <lb/>
            and those too must be such as are sung, not by loud voices, <lb/>
            but by the invisible and pure mind, which shall raise the <lb/>
            shout and song to him. At all events there is an old saying <lb/>
            often quoted, originally invented by wise men, but, as is <lb/>
            often the case, handed down in succession to future ages, <lb/>
            and one which has not escaped our ears, which are always <lb/>
            greedy of instruction, and it is to this effect, " When," <lb/>
            say they, " the Creator had finished the whole world, he <lb/>
            asked of one of his ministers, whether he felt that any thing <lb/>
            that was wanting which had not been created of all the <lb/>
            things that are in the earth, or in the water, or of all that <lb/>
            have received the sublime nature of the air, or the loftiest <lb/>
            nature of all the universe, namely, that of the heaven ; and <lb/>
            he replied, that every thing every where was perfect and <lb/>
             <pb n="442"/>
            complete ; but that he wished for one thing only, namely <lb/>
            for reason, which should be able duly to praise it all, and <lb/>
            which should not so much praise as give an accurate account <lb/>
            of the exceeding excellence existing throughout, even in these <lb/>
            things which appeared the most unimportant and the most <lb/>
            obscure ; for lie said that an exact account of the works of <lb/>
            God was their most complete and adequate panegyric, since <lb/>
            they required no addition of external things to set them <lb/>
            forth, but were of such a character that the bare plain truth <lb/>
            was their most perfect encomium." And when the Father <lb/>
            had heard what be said he praised it all, and at no distant <lb/>
            time produced a race, which should be capable of receiving <lb/>
            all learning, and of composing hymns of praise, producing <lb/>
            them from one of the faculties existing around him, the virgin <lb/>
            memory, whose name men in general distort and call her <lb/>
            Mnemosyne.</p>
          <p>XXXI. This is then the purport of that legend of the <lb/>
            ancients, and we in accordance with that story say, that it <lb/>
            is the most appropriate work of God to confer benefits, and <lb/>
            of created beings to show gratitude, since they are unable <lb/>
            to give any requital of those benefits beyond gratitude ; for <lb/>
            whatever he might be inclined to give as a requital for the <lb/>
            other things which he has received, will be found to be the <lb/>
            private property of him who is the Creator of all things, <lb/>
            and not of the nature which offers it. Having learnt there­ <lb/>
            fore that there is only one employment possible for us of all <lb/>
            the things that seem to contribute to the honour of God, <lb/>
            namely the display of gratitude, let us at all times and in <lb/>
            all places study this, with our voice, and with useful writings, <lb/>
            and let its never desist composing encomiastic orations and <lb/>
            poems, in order that both the Creator and the world may be <lb/>
            honoured by every description of utterance which can be <lb/>
            exhibited in either speaking or singing; the one being, as <lb/>
            some has said, the best of all causes, and the other the most <lb/>
            perfect of all created things.</p>
          <p>XXXII. Since therefore all the fruit of the soul is con­ <lb/>
            secrated in the fourth year and the fourth number; in the <lb/>
            fifth year we ourselves shall be allowed the use and enjoy­ <lb/>
            ment of it for ourselves ; for the scripture says, " In the <lb/>
            fifth year ye shall eat the fruit thereof;" since it has been <lb/>
            established by a perpetual law of nature, that account shall <lb/>
             <pb n="443"/>
            be taken of the creation after the Creator in every thing; so <lb/>
            that even if we are thought worthy of the second place, it <lb/>
            must be considered a marvellous thing; and on this account <lb/>
            it assigns to us the fruit of the fifth year, because the <lb/>
            number five is the number appropriate to the outward <lb/>
            sense; and if one must tell the truth, that which nourishes <lb/>
            our minds is the outward sense, which by means of our eyes <lb/>
            sets before us the distinctive qualities of colours and forms, <lb/>
            and by means of our ears presents us with all the various <lb/>
            peculiarities of sounds, and with smells by means of the <lb/>
            nose, and with tastes through the medium of the mouth, <lb/>
            and which enables us to judge of the yielding softness and <lb/>
            resisting hardness, or of softness and roughness, or again <lb/>
            of heat and cold, by means of the faculty which is dispersed <lb/>
            over the whole body, which we usually denominate touch.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. But the most correct example of what has <lb/>
            been said, is afforded by the sons of Leah, that is of virtue, <lb/>
            not all her sons, but the fourth and fifth ; for with respect <lb/>
            to the fourth, Moses says that, then she ceased to bring <lb/>
            fortli,* and his name was called Judah, which, being in­ <lb/>
            terpreted, is " confession to the Lord," and the fifth she <lb/>
            4 called Issachar, and the name being interpreted, means <lb/>
            “reward;” and after she had brought forth in this manner, <lb/>
            the soul immediately spoke and related what it had suffered ; <lb/>
            for says Moses, " She called his name Issachar, which means <lb/>
            reward.”† Therefore Judas, the mind which blesses God, <lb/>
            and which is without ceasing, devoted to pouring forth <lb/>
            hymns of praise and gratitude to him, is himself in truth <lb/>
            " the holy and praiseworthy fruit,”‡ being produced not by <lb/>
            the trees of the earth but by a rational and virtuous nature. <lb/>
            In reference to which, the nature which brought him forth <lb/>
            is said to have desisted from bringing forth, since she knew <lb/>
            not which way to turn, when she had come to the limit of <lb/>
            perfection; for of all successful actions which are brought <lb/>
            forth, the best and most perfect production is a hymn to the <lb/>
            Father of the universe; and the fifth son is in no respect <lb/>
            different from the enjoyment of the trees planted in the <lb/>
            fifth year; for the tiller of the earth after a fashion takes <lb/>
            his reward from the trees in the fifth year, and he takes the <lb/>
            offspring of the soul, Issachar, who was called the “reward,” <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 33. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxx. IS. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Leviticus xix. 24. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="444"/>
            and very naturally, being brought forth after the grateful <lb/>
            Judah ; for to a grateful person gratitude is a most sufficient <lb/>
            reward. Therefore, the fruits of the trees are called the <lb/>
            produce of the owners of the trees ; but the fruit of in­ <lb/>
            struction and wisdom is no longer the produce of man, but <lb/>
            as Moses says, " of the universal Governor alone for after <lb/>
            he has spoken of his produce, he adds, " I am the Lord <lb/>
            your God," asserting most distinctly that there is one God, <lb/>
            whose fruit is the produce of the soul.</p>
          <p>And with this assertion, this oracle delivered by one of the <lb/>
            prophets is consistent, " Fruit from me has been found by <lb/>
            you. What wise man will understand this ? Will any in­ <lb/>
            telligent person comprehend it ?"* For it does not belong <lb/>
            to every one, but only to the wise man, to understand whose <lb/>
            the fruit of the mind is.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Therefore, concerning that most ancient and <lb/>
            sacred husbandry, which the Cause of all things uses with <lb/>
            reference to the world, that most productive of trees, and <lb/>
            concerning that other kind in imitation of it which the vir­ <lb/>
            tuous mail studies, and concerning the ordinary quaternion of <lb/>
            prizes, and the laws and precepts which all tend to the same <lb/>
            point, we have now spoken to the best of our power.</p>
          <p>Let us now consider the vine-planting of the just Noah <lb/>
            which is a species of husbandry.</p>
          <p>For it is said that " Noah began to be a husbandman of <lb/>
            the earth, and he planted a vineyard, and drank of the wine, <lb/>
            and got drunk.”† Therefore, the wise man here cultivates <lb/>
            with skill and science the tree of drunkenness, though fools <lb/>
            enter upon its management in an unartistic and negligent <lb/>
            manner, so that it is necessary for us now to speak in a fitting <lb/>
            manner about drunkenness ; for we shall presently know the <lb/>
            power also of that tree which gives rise to it. Afterwards, <lb/>
            we will examine with accuracy what has been said by the <lb/>
            lawgiver concerning drunkenness, but at present we will ex­ <lb/>
            amine what determination others have come to on this <lb/>
            subject.</p>
          <p>XXXV. Now, among many philosophers, this question <lb/>
            has been investigated with no slight degree of pains, and <lb/>
            the question is proposed in this manner, whether the wise <lb/>
            man will get drunk? Therefore, to get drunk is a matter <note type="footnote"> * Hosea xiv. 9. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis ix. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="445"/>
            of a twofold nature, one part of it being equivalent to being <lb/>
            overcome with wine ; the other, to behaving foolishly in one's <lb/>
            cups. But of those who have dealt with this proposition, <lb/>
            some have said that the wise man never takes too much un­ <lb/>
            mixed wine, and never behaves foolishly; for that the one is <lb/>
            an error, and that the other is an efficient cause of error, and <lb/>
            that both the one and the other is inconsistent with good <lb/>
            conduct. Others again have asserted, that to be overcome <lb/>
            with wine is appropriate even to a virtuous man, but that to <lb/>
            behave foolishly is inconsistent with his character. For that <lb/>
            the wisdom which is in him is sufficient to resist those things <lb/>
            which attempt to do him injury, and to destroy the innova­ <lb/>
            tions which they seek to produce in the soul, and that in-is­ <lb/>
            dom is endued with a power capable of extinguishing the <lb/>
            passions, whether they be fanned by the impetuous gale of <lb/>
            furious love, or kindled by abundant and heating wine, and <lb/>
            that owing to this power it will always be superior to <lb/>
            them.</p>
          <p>Since also of those who dive beneath a deep river or under <lb/>
            the sea, some are destroyed from being ignorant of the art of <lb/>
            swimming, but others who are possessed of this knowledge <lb/>
            are very speedily saved; and, indeed, a great quantity of <lb/>
            wine, inundating the soul like a torrent, sometimes weighs <lb/>
            it down and precipitates it to the lowest depth of ignorance, <lb/>
            but at other times is unable to part it, because it is supported <lb/>
            and borne aloft by saving instruction.</p>
          <p>Those again who have not sufficiently observed the great­ <lb/>
            ness of this excess with respect to passion in the wise man, <lb/>
            have pressed him down, when he was applying himself to the <lb/>
            study of sublime things, from heaven to earth, as those men <lb/>
            do who are seeking to catch birds, in order to involve him in <lb/>
            disasters similar to their own ; but others, seeing the great <lb/>
            height of his virtue, have said that a wise man, if he indulges <lb/>
            in wine beyond the bounds of moderation, will by all means <lb/>
            cease to be master of himself, and will go astray, and will <lb/>
            not only let his hands droop out of weakness, like those ath­ <lb/>
            letes do who are defeated, but will also droop his neck and <lb/>
            his head, and stumble, and fall down, coming to the ground <lb/>
            with his whole body.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. Having then learnt this beforehand, the wise <lb/>
            man will never of his own accord think fit to enter upon a <lb/>
             <pb n="446"/>
            contest of hard drinking, unless there were great things at <lb/>
            stake, such as the safety of his country, or the honour of his <lb/>
            parents, or the preservation of his children, or of his nearest <lb/>
            relations, or in short, the success and prosperity of some im­ <lb/>
            portant public or private interest. For he would not take <lb/>
            a deadly poison unless the occasion compelled him very <lb/>
            strongly to depart from life, as it might urge him to depart <lb/>
            from his country. And at all events it is plain, that un­ <lb/>
            mixed wine is a poison, which is the cause, if not of death, <lb/>
            at least of madness, and why may we not pronounce mad­ <lb/>
            ness to be death, since by it the most important thing in <lb/>
            us dies, namely, the mind ? But it appears to me that a <lb/>
            man would without the slightest hesitation choose (if a choice <lb/>
            was permitted him), that death which separates and disunites <lb/>
            the soul and the body as a lesser evil in preference to that <lb/>
            greater one-the alienation of the mind.</p>
          <p>On this account, forsooth, men of old time called skill in <lb/>
            the art of making wine madness (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μαινομένη</foreign>), and called the <lb/>
            Bacchæ who were carried away under the influence of wine, <lb/>
            mad women (<foreign xml:lang="grc">Μαινάδες</foreign>), since wine is the cause of madness <lb/>
            and folly to those who indulge in it insatiably.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. Such then are, as it were, the prefaces of this <lb/>
            discussion or investigation. Let us now go on to the other <lb/>
            parts of this question which is divided into two heads as is <lb/>
            natural; the one view affirming that the wise man will occa­ <lb/>
            sionally be drunk, and the other, on the contrary, insisting <lb/>
            that he will not get drunk. Now it is well to ruminate the <lb/>
            arguments which are adduced in support of the former view, <lb/>
            having first of all taken our beginning from this point, that <lb/>
            of things some are homonymous, and others are only synony­ <lb/>
            mous. And it is admitted that the being homonymous and <lb/>
            the being synonymous are two opposite things, because <lb/>
            homonymy is predicated of many subjects which have one <lb/>
            common name ; and synonymy is the application of many <lb/>
            different names to one subject. For instance, the name of <lb/>
            do, is beyond all question a. homonymy, inasmuch as it com­ <lb/>
            prehends many dissimilar things which are signified by that <lb/>
            appellation. For there is a terrestrial barking animal called <lb/>
            a do,; there is also a marine monster with the same name ; <lb/>
            there is also the star in heaven, which the poets call the <lb/>
            autumnal star, because it rises at the beginning of autumn, <lb/>
             <pb n="447"/>
            for the sake of ripening the fruits and bringing them to per­ <lb/>
            fection. Moreover, there were the philosophers who came <lb/>
            from the cynic school, Aristippus and Diogenes ; and others <lb/>
            too who chose to practise the same mode of life, an incal­ <lb/>
            culable number of men.</p>
          <p>Again there are other appellations which differ from one <lb/>
            another, but still signify but one thing, as a shaft, a bolt, <lb/>
            an arrow ; for all these terms are applied to the weapon which <lb/>
            is sent from the string of the bow against the mark; and <lb/>
            again there are the words, oar, scull, and blade, to express the <lb/>
            instrument used for propelling a vessel, of equal power with <lb/>
            sails ; for whenever a ship, by reason of a calm or of un­ <lb/>
            favourable winds cannot use its sails, then those, whose busi­ <lb/>
            ness it is, sitting down as rowers, and stretching out their <lb/>
            oars on each side like wings, compel it to proceed onwards as <lb/>
            if borne on wings ; and so the vessel being borne on the top <lb/>
            of the waves, and rather running over them than cutting <lb/>
            through them, hastens along with a speedy voyage, and <lb/>
            speedily anchors in a safe harbour. And again, a staff, and <lb/>
            a stick, and a cane, are all different appellations of one sub­ <lb/>
            ject with which we can strike, or support one's self steadily, <lb/>
            and on which one can lean, and do many other things besides. <lb/>
            And we have enumerated these instances not for the purpose <lb/>
            of making a long story, but in order that the matter under in­ <lb/>
            vestigation may be more clearly understood.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. The ancients called unmixed wine <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος</foreign>, and <lb/>
            also <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθυ</foreign>. At all events, this latter name is used in very <lb/>
            many passages of poetry, so that if those names are accounted <lb/>
            synonymous which are applied to one subject, then <foreign xml:lang="grc">οἶνος</foreign> and <lb/>
            <foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθυσμα</foreign>, and other words derived from them will differ in <lb/>
            nothing but sound, and the being overcome with wine <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">οἰνου̃σθαι</foreign>), and the being drunk (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθύειν</foreign>), are one and the <lb/>
            same thing. And both these words intimate a taking of <lb/>
            too much wine, which nevertheless there may be many <lb/>
            reasons for a good man not turning away from ; and if he be <lb/>
            overcome with wine he will also be drunk, being nevertheless <lb/>
            not made in any respect the worse by his drunkenness, but <lb/>
            remaining the same as if he had simply been well filled with <lb/>
            wine.</p>
          <p>We have now detailed one of the opinions concerning a <lb/>
            wise man getting drunk: and the second is as follows :— <lb/>
             <pb n="448"/>
            The men of the present clay, with the exception of a <lb/>
            small portion of them, do not choose in any way to resemble <lb/>
            the men of old times; but both in mind and action they <lb/>
            show that they are in no respect agreed with them, but <lb/>
            that they differ from them widely. For they have made <lb/>
            such a revolution as to bring reasons which were sound and <lb/>
            healthy into incurable decay and destruction. And in the <lb/>
            place of a vigorous and athletic habit, they have brought <lb/>
            almost every thing into a state of disease; and in the place <lb/>
            of a full, and strong, and sinewy body, they have rendered <lb/>
            it weak, inducing an unnatural, and swollen, and sickly <lb/>
            habit, filling it up with empty wind alone, which soon <lb/>
            bursts by reason of the want of any power to keep it to­ <lb/>
            gether, when it is extended in the greatest degree. And the <lb/>
            actions of created beings, which are most worthy of atten­ <lb/>
            tion, and which were, as one may say, masculine actions, <lb/>
            those also they have made disgraceful feminine instead, and <lb/>
            discreditable instead of honourable, so that there are very <lb/>
            few persons found, either in deed or in words, inclined to an <lb/>
            imitation of the ancient manners.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the poets and historians who lived in their <lb/>
            time, and all ether men who devoted themselves to literary <lb/>
            studies, did not confine themselves to soothing and tick­ <lb/>
            ling the ears with rhythmical sounds, but, if there was any­ <lb/>
            thing broken, so to say, and relaxed in the mind, they <lb/>
            roused it up, and whatever there was in it suited to their <lb/>
            purpose they improved by initiation into natural philosophy <lb/>
            and virtue. But the cooks and confectioners of our time, <lb/>
            and those persons who are only artists of superfluous luxury, <lb/>
            in the arts of dyeing and making perfumes, are always <lb/>
            building up the outward senses with some new colour, or <lb/>
            shape, or scent, or flavour, so as utterly to destroy the most <lb/>
            important part of us, the mind.</p>
          <p>XXXIX. And why do 1 mention these things ? In order <lb/>
            to show that the men of the present day do not use wine <lb/>
            now as the ancients did. For now they drink eagerly <lb/>
            without once taking breath, till the body and soul are both <lb/>
            wholly relaxed, and they keep on bidding their cup-bearers <lb/>
            to bring more wine, and are angry with them if they delay <lb/>
            while they are cooling what is called by them the hot drink; <lb/>
            and in a vile imitation of the gymnastic contests, they insti­ <lb/>
             <pb n="449"/>
            tute a contest among their fellow revellers as to who can <lb/>
            drink most wine, in which they do many glorious things to <lb/>
            one another, biting one another's ears and noses, and the <lb/>
            tips of the fingers of their hands, and any other parts of <lb/>
            the body they can get at. Now, these are the contests of <lb/>
            revelry while in youth and vigour, and, as one may say, in <lb/>
            its prime; but the others are the deeds of that ancient and <lb/>
            more old-fashioned sort. For the men of old time began <lb/>
            every good action with perfect sacrifices, thinking that in <lb/>
            that way the result would be most favourable to them; and <lb/>
            even if the occasion required especial promptitude in action, <lb/>
            still they did not begin till they had offered prayers and <lb/>
            sacrifices. But in all cases waited, thinking that haste was <lb/>
            not in every case better than slowness. For speed, which is <lb/>
            not accompanied with forethought, is injurious, but slowness, <lb/>
            when founded on good hope, is advantageous.</p>
          <p>Knowing, therefore, that the use and enjoyment of wine <lb/>
            require much care, they did not drink unmixed wine either <lb/>
            in great quantities or at all times, but only in moderation <lb/>
            and on fitting occasions. For first, of all, they offered up <lb/>
            prayers and instituted sacrifices, and then, having propitiated <lb/>
            the deity, and having purified their bodies and souls, the <lb/>
            former with baths, and the latter with the waters of laws <lb/>
            and of right instruction, they then turned their cheerful <lb/>
            and rejoicing countenances to more luxurious food, very <lb/>
            often not returning home but, walking about in the temples <lb/>
            in which they sacrificed, in order that, by keeping in mind <lb/>
            their sacrifices, and having a due respect for the place, they <lb/>
            might enjoy what should be really a most sacred feast, doing <lb/>
            no wrong either in word or deed. And this, indeed, is <lb/>
            what they say the word [<foreign xml:lang="grc">μεθύειν</foreign>, to be drunk, derives its name <lb/>
            from; because, <foreign xml:lang="grc">μετὰΤΟ θύειν</foreign> (after sacrificing) it was the <lb/>
            custom of the men of old to drink great quantities of wine.</p>
          <p>And to whom could the manner of using unmixed wine <lb/>
            described above be more appropriate than to wise men to <lb/>
            whom the work to be done before drinking, namely, <lb/>
            sacrificing, is so appropriate ? For one may almost say that <lb/>
            no bad man can really perform sacrifices, not even if he <lb/>
            were to bring the altar ten thousand oxen every day without <lb/>
            intermission; for his most important and indispensable <lb/>
            offering, namely his mind, is polluted. And it is impious for <note type="footnote"> G G </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="450"/>
            polluted things to come near to the altar. This, now, is the <lb/>
            second point of view in which this question may be regarded, <lb/>
            bywhieh we have shown that it is not inconsistent with the <lb/>
            character of the wise man to get drunk.</p>
          <p>XL. There is a third way of looking at this subject, which <lb/>
            depends ehiefly on the exceeding plausibility of an argument <lb/>
            derived from etymology. For some persons think that <lb/>
            drunkenness derives its name not merely from the <lb/>
            fact of its being admitted after saerifice, but also because it <lb/>
            is the cause of relaxation (<foreign xml:lang="grc">μέθεσις</foreign>) to the soul. But the <lb/>
            reason of foolish men is relaxed so as to get strength for <lb/>
            many sins; while that of those inclined to be sensible is <lb/>
            relaxed, so as to enjoy freedom from care, and eheerfulness, <lb/>
            and lightness of heart. For the wise man, when he is <lb/>
            intoxicated, becomes more good-humoured than when he is <lb/>
            sober; so that in this respect we should not be at all wrong <lb/>
            in saying that he may get drunk. And besides all this, we <lb/>
            must likewise add, that we are not speaking of a stern- <lb/>
            looking and sordid kind of wisdom, contracted by profound <lb/>
            thought and ill-humour; but, on the other hand, of that <lb/>
            wisdom whieh wears a tranquil and cheerful appearance, <lb/>
            being full of joy and happiness, by which men have often <lb/>
            been led on to sport and divert themselves in no inelegant <lb/>
            manner, indulging in amusements suitable to their dignified <lb/>
            and earnest character, just as in a well-tuned lyre one may <lb/>
            have a combination uniting, by means of opposite sounds, in <lb/>
            one melodious harmony.</p>
          <p>At all events, according to the most holy Moses, the end <lb/>
            of all wisdom is amusement and mirth, not such mirth as is <lb/>
            pursued by foolish people, uneombined with any prudence, <lb/>
            but such as is admitted even by those who are already grey, <lb/>
            not only through old age alone, but also through deep think­ <lb/>
            ing. Do you not see that he speaks of the man who has <lb/>
            drunk deeply of that wisdom which is to be derived from a <lb/>
            man's own hearing, and learning, and study; not as one who <lb/>
            partakes of mirth, but who is actually mirth in itself? This <lb/>
            is Isaae, for the name Isaae being interpreted means "laugh­ <lb/>
            ter," with whose character it is very consistent that he should <lb/>
            have been sporting with " perseverance," which the Hebrews <lb/>
            call Rebekkah.</p>
          <p>XLI. But it is not lawful for a private individual to <lb/>
             <pb n="451"/>
            behold the divine instruction of the soul, but the king may <lb/>
            behold it, as one with whom wisdom has dwelt for a very long <lb/>
            time, if we may not rather say that it dwells with him all his <lb/>
            life. His name is Abimelech, who, looking out through the <lb/>
            window with the well-opened and radiant eye of the mind, <lb/>
            saw Isaac sporting with Rebekkah his wife. For what employ­ <lb/>
            ment is more suitable for a wise man than to be sporting, <lb/>
            and rejoicing, and diverting himself with perseverance in <lb/>
            good things ? From which it is plain that he will become <lb/>
            intoxicated, since intoxication contributes to good morals, <lb/>
            and also produces relaxation and advantage; for unmixed <lb/>
            wine seems to increase and render more intense all the <lb/>
            natural qualities, whether they be good or the contrary, as <lb/>
            many other things do too. For money is to a good man a <lb/>
            cause of good things, and to a bad man, as some one has <lb/>
            said, it is a cause of bad things. And again, high rank <lb/>
            makes the wickedness of a fool more conspicuous, but it <lb/>
            renders the virtue of the just man more glorious.</p>
          <p>So also unmixed wine, being poured forth in abundance, <lb/>
            makes the man who is the slave of his passions, still more <lb/>
            subservient to them, but it renders him who has them under <lb/>
            control more manageable and amiable. Who, indeed, is <lb/>
            there who does not know that of two opposite things, when <lb/>
            one kind is suitable to most people, the other kind must of <lb/>
            necessity be suited to some ? As, for instance, white and <lb/>
            black are two opposite colours: if white is suitable both to <lb/>
            good and to bad things, then black must also be necessarily <lb/>
            equally suitable to both, and not to one of the two alone. <lb/>
            And, again, to be sober and to be drunk are two opposite <lb/>
            things; accordingly, both bad men and good, as the ancient <lb/>
            proverb says, partake of sobriety; therefore, also, drunken­ <lb/>
            ness is suitable to both classes. Therefore the virtuous man <lb/>
            will get drunk without losing any of his virtue by it.</p>
          <p>XLII. But if, like persons before a court of justice, one <lb/>
            must bring forward not only such proofs as are in accordance <lb/>
            with the rules of art, but those too which have no connection <lb/>
            with art, one of which is proof by testimony, we will then pro­ <lb/>
            duce many sons of physicians and philosophers of high repute <lb/>
            to give evidenec, not by words alone, but also by writings. <lb/>
            For they have left behind ten thousand commentaries <lb/>
            entitled treatises on drunkenness ; in which they consider <note type="footnote"> G G 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="452"/>
            nothing beyond the bare use of wine, without pursuing any <lb/>
            investigation with respect to those who are accustomed to <lb/>
            behave foolishly in their cups, and in fact omitting every <lb/>
            thing which has reference to conduct under the influence of <lb/>
            wine ; so that it is very plainly confessed in their writings <lb/>
            that drunkenness is the same as drinking wine freely. And <lb/>
            to drink a superabundant quantity of wine on proper occa­ <lb/>
            sions is not unsuitable to a wise man ; therefore we shall <lb/>
            not be wrong if we say that a wise man may get drunk.</p>
          <p>But since no one is ever inscribed on the rolls as a con­ <lb/>
            queror if he has contended by himself alone, for if he does this <lb/>
            he appears only to be fighting with a shadow, and very <lb/>
            naturally too; it follows that we must also produce the <lb/>
            arguments of those who contend for the opposite side of the <lb/>
            question, that by this means a most just judgment may be <lb/>
            formed, and that the other side of the question may not be <lb/>
            decided against through default. And the first and the most <lb/>
            powerful argument is this: if no one in his senses would <lb/>
            entrust a secret which lie wished to be kept to a drunken <lb/>
            man, then a good and wise man will not get drunk. But <lb/>
            before we collect all the other arguments in their order, it may <lb/>
            be better to reply to each objection separately, in order that <lb/>
            we may not appear to be too prolix, and consequently to be <lb/>
            troublesome.</p>
          <p>Some one then will say in opposition that, according to <lb/>
            the argument that has been advanced, the wise man must <lb/>
            never have a bilious attack, and never go to sleep, and above <lb/>
            all must never die. But he to whom some of these things <lb/>
            happens is either an inanimate being or a divine one; but <lb/>
            beyond all question he is not a man at all. Imitating this <lb/>
            perversion of the arguments, one may apply it equally to a <lb/>
            bilious man, or to a sleeping man, or to a dying man; for <lb/>
            no one in his senses would tell a secret to a man in any of <lb/>
            these conditions, but it would be reasonable for him to tell <lb/>
            it to a wise man, for the wise man is never bilious, never <lb/>
            goes to sleep, and never dies.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON DRUNKENNESS.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. WHAT has been said by other philosophers about drunk­ <lb/>
            enness we have to the best of our ability recorded in the <lb/>
            treatise before this present one. But now let us consider <lb/>
            what is the opinion of the lawgiver, who was in all respects <lb/>
            great and wise, on this subject; for in many places of his <lb/>
            history of the giving of the law he mentions wine, and the <lb/>
            plant which produces wine, namely the vine; and he commands <lb/>
            somepersonsto drink it, but some he does not permit to do so; <lb/>
            and at times he gives contrary directions to the same people, <lb/>
            ordering them sometimes to drink and some times to abstain. <lb/>
            These therefore are the persons who have taken the great <lb/>
            vow, to whom it is expressly forbidden to drink unmixed wine, <lb/>
            being the priests who are engaged in offering sacrifices. But <lb/>
            those who drink wine are numerous beyond all calculation, <lb/>
            and among them are all those who are especially praised by <lb/>
            the lawgiver for their virtue. But before we begin to talk <lb/>
            of these subjects we will examine with accuracy some points <lb/>
            that concern this argument, and, as I at least imagine they <lb/>
            are these.</p>
          <p>II. Moses looks upon an unmixed wine as a symbol not <lb/>
            of one thing only but of many, namely of trifling, and playing <lb/>
            the fool, and of all kinds of insensibility and of insatiable <lb/>
            greediness, and of a covetousness which is hard to be pleased, <lb/>
            and of a cheerfulness which comprehends many other objects, <lb/>
            and of a nakedness which is apparent in all the things now <lb/>
            mentioned, such as that which he says Noah, when drunk, <lb/>
            displayed himself in. Wine, then, is said to produce all these <lb/>
            effects. But great numbers of person who, because they <lb/>
            never touch unmixed wine, look upon themselves as sober, are <lb/>
            them involved in the same accusation. Andonemayseesomeof <lb/>
            acting in a foolish and senseless manner, and others possessed <lb/>
            by complete insensibility; and others again who are never <lb/>
            satisfied, but are always thirsting for what cannot be obtained, <lb/>
            because of their want of knowledge ; others, on the other <lb/>
            hand rejoicing and exulting; and others in good truth naked. <lb/>
            The cause now of behaving foolishlyisamischievous ignorance; <lb/>
            I mean by this expression, not an ignorance of such things <lb/>
             <pb n="454"/>
            as are matters of instruction but an alienation from, and <lb/>
            dislike of knowledge.</p>
          <p>The cause again of insensibility is a treacherous and <lb/>
            mutilated ignorance. The cause of insatiability is a most <lb/>
            grievous appetite for the indulgence of the passions of the <lb/>
            soul. The cause of <unclear>cheerfulness</unclear> is at once the acquisition <lb/>
            and the employment of virtue. Of nakedness there are <lb/>
            many causes-an ignorance of such things as are opposite <lb/>
            to one another; complete innocence and simplicity of <lb/>
            manners; truth, which strips ont' all the coverings of such <lb/>
            things as are concealed, on the one side revealing virtue to <lb/>
            our eyes, and on the other side, in its turn, uncovering vice ; <lb/>
            for no one can possibly put off both these things at one <lb/>
            time, nor can he either strip them both off together But <lb/>
            when any one discards the one, he must of necessity take up <lb/>
            and clothe himself with the other. For as the old story <lb/>
            tells us, God, when he had combined pleasure and pain, two <lb/>
            things naturally at variance, under one head, gave to us an <lb/>
            outward sense capable of appreciating them both, not at the <lb/>
            same moment, but at different times, fixing the period of <lb/>
            the return of one to be simultaneous with the moment of <lb/>
            the flight of the other. Thus from one root of the domi­ <lb/>
            nant principle, the two shoots of virtue and vice sprang up, <lb/>
            neither blossoming nor bearing fruit at the same time; for <lb/>
            when the one loses its leaves and fades away, then the other <lb/>
            begins to shoot, and blossom, and look green, so that one <lb/>
            might fancy that the one withered through dissatisfaction <lb/>
            at the blooming appearance of the other.</p>
          <p>It is with reference to this that Moses represents in a <lb/>
            most natural manner the departure of Jacob to be contem­ <lb/>
            poraneous with the arrival of Esau ; " For it came to pass," <lb/>
            says he, " that as Jacob went out his brother Esau came in."* <lb/>
            As long, indeed, as prudence dwells in and makes his abode <lb/>
            in the soul, so long every companion of folly is discarded <lb/>
            and banished to a distance ; but when prudence departs <lb/>
            then folly rejoices and enters, since its enemy and adversary, <lb/>
            for whose sake it was driven away and banished, is no longer <lb/>
            inhabiting the same place as before.</p>
          <p>III. We have now then said enough by way of preface <lb/>
            to this treatise. We will proceed to adduce the proofs of <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxvii. 30. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="455"/>
            all that we have said, beginning first of all to establish the <lb/>
            first point.</p>
          <p>We said, then, that ignorance was the cause of man's <lb/>
            behaving foolishly and misconducting himself, just as a <lb/>
            great quantity of unmixed wine is to great numbers of <lb/>
            foolish persons; for ignorance is the primary evil of all the <lb/>
            errors of the soul, if we must tell the truth, from which, as <lb/>
            from a spring, all the actions of life do flow, never producing <lb/>
            to any one, one single stream of wholesome or drinkable <lb/>
            water, but only brackish water, the cause of disease and <lb/>
            destruction to all who use it. Thus, at all events, the law­ <lb/>
            giver is very indignant with all uninstrncted and unmanage­ <lb/>
            able persons, more than he is with any other description of <lb/>
            people whatever. And a proof of this is this : who are they <lb/>
            who are united in alliance not so much by study as by <lb/>
            nature, whether among men or among the other kinds of <lb/>
            animals ? No one; not even a madman would say that any <lb/>
            beings were so closely united as parents and children; for <lb/>
            even by the mere untaught instinct of nature the parent <lb/>
            always cares for his offspring, and in every case endeavours <lb/>
            to provide for its safety and durability.</p>
          <p>IV. Those, then, who are the natural protectors of others, <lb/>
            Moses represents as having crossed over to the ranks of <lb/>
            enemies, making those accusers who would naturally have <lb/>
            been advocates, I mean the father and mother, in order that <lb/>
            the children may be destroyed by those by whom above all <lb/>
            others it was natural they should be saved; " For if," says <lb/>
            he, "any man's son be disobedient, or contentions, not <lb/>
            obeying the voice of his father and of his mother, and if they <lb/>
            reprove him and he does not listen to them, then his father <lb/>
            and his mother shall take him, and shall bring him before <lb/>
            the elders of the city, and shall bring him to the gate of <lb/>
            that place, and shall say to the men of their city, This our <lb/>
            son is disobedient and contentious, and does not obey our <lb/>
            voice, but spends his time in revelling and drunkenness. <lb/>
            And the men of that city shall stone him, and you shall <lb/>
            destroy that wicked one from among you."* Therefore, <lb/>
            here the accusations are four in number-disobedience, and <lb/>
            contentiousness, and love of revelling, and drunkenness; and <lb/>
            the last of these is the greatest, deriving its growth from <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxi. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="456"/>
            the first, namely, from disobedience; for when the soul <lb/>
            begins to be restive it advances onward through contention <lb/>
            and quarrelsomeness, and arrives at last at the furthest <lb/>
            boundary, drunkenness, the cause of alienation of mind and <lb/>
            folly. But it is requisite to see the force of each of all these <lb/>
            accusations, beginning with the first in order.</p>
          <p>V. It is then confessed by all most undeniably, that it is <lb/>
            both honourable and advantageous to yield and to become <lb/>
            obedient to virtue, so that on the other hand to be disobe­ <lb/>
            dient to it must be disgraceful and in no moderate degree <lb/>
            disadvantageous. And to be contentious and obstinate is a <lb/>
            quality which comprehends every extravagance of evil; for­ <lb/>
            the man who is disobedient is less wicked than he who is <lb/>
            contentious, since the one only disregards what he is com­ <lb/>
            manded to do, but the other also exerts himself to do the <lb/>
            contrary. Come, now, let us investigate the true nature of <lb/>
            these things.</p>
          <p>Since the law commands, for instance, that men should <lb/>
            honour their parents, he who does not honour them is dis­ <lb/>
            obedient ; but he who dishonours them is contentious. And <lb/>
            again, since it is a righteous action to preserve one's coun­ <lb/>
            try, we must call the man who admits of hesitation in the <lb/>
            pursuit of the object disobedient, but the man who is pre­ <lb/>
            pared moreover to betray it we must pronounce perverse <lb/>
            and contentious. Again, he who, when requested to requite <lb/>
            a favour, contradicts the man who says that he ought to <lb/>
            consider himself a debtor, is disobedient; but he who, in <lb/>
            addition to making no return, is so carried away by conten­ <lb/>
            tiousness that he endeavours to do the person what harm he <lb/>
            can, commits unredeemable wickedness. And further, he <lb/>
            who never approaches, nor practises sacrifices, or any of the <lb/>
            other observances required by piety, disobeys the command­ <lb/>
            ments which the law usually ordains in such matters; but <lb/>
            he who resists and turns aside to the opposite disposition, <lb/>
            impiety, is a wicked man and a minister of impiety.</p>
          <p>VI. Such a mail as this was he who said, " Who is there <lb/>
            whom I am to obey?" and again, "I do not know the <lb/>
            Lord."* For by his first expression lie states that there is <lb/>
            no such thing as a Deity; and by the second question he <lb/>
            means, that even if there is such a being, still he will not <note type="footnote"> * Exodus v. 2. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="457"/>
            recognize him, which arises from a deficiency in his provi­ <lb/>
            dence ; for if he were possessed of providence he would be <lb/>
            recognized.</p>
          <p>Now to bring contributions and supplies in aid of an <lb/>
            entertainment with a view to a participation in that best of <lb/>
            all possessions, prudence, is praiseworthy and advantageous. <lb/>
            But to do so with a view to the worst of all objects, folly, is <lb/>
            disadvantageous and blameable ; therefore, the contributions <lb/>
            for the most excellent object are the desire of virtue, the <lb/>
            imitation of good men, continued care, laborious practice, <lb/>
            incessant and unwearied labours ; the contributions for the <lb/>
            opposite object are relaxation, indifference, luxury, effemi­ <lb/>
            nacy, and a complete desertion of what is right. And we <lb/>
            may see those who every day descend into the arena to con­ <lb/>
            tend in drinking much wine, and practising this quality <lb/>
            every day, and striving to gain the victory in greediness <lb/>
            and voracity, bringing their contributions as though they <lb/>
            had some desirable object in view, and injuring themselves <lb/>
            in every thing, in their property, and their bodies, and their <lb/>
            souls ; for by contributing their property they diminish their <lb/>
            substance ; and they break down and enervate the powers of <lb/>
            their bodies by their luxurious way of life, and as for their <lb/>
            souls, inundating them with immoderate food like a swollen <lb/>
            torrent, they compel that to sink down to the lowest depth.</p>
          <p>For the same manner all those, who bring contributions <lb/>
            for the destruction of learning, injure the most important <lb/>
            thing in them, namely, their mind, cutting off every thing <lb/>
            that might save it—prudence, and temperance, and courage, <lb/>
            and justice; on which account he seems to me himself to <lb/>
            use a compound word, <foreign xml:lang="grc">συμβολοϰοπω̃ν</foreign>, for the more manifest <lb/>
            manifestation of his meaning, because they who bring for­ <lb/>
            ward attempts at virtue as their offering and contribution, <lb/>
            wound and lacerate, and cut to pieces, obedient and learn­ <lb/>
            ing-loving souls to the extent of their utter destruction.</p>
          <p>VII. Therefore the wise Abraham is said to have returned <lb/>
            again from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings <lb/>
            who were with him.* And on the other hand, Amalek is <lb/>
            said to have cut to pieces the rear of the company of the <lb/>
            meditator of virtue,! in strict accordance with the truth of <lb/>
            nature; for what is contrary to one is also hostile to the other, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 17. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxv. 18. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="458"/>
            and such things are always meditating the destruction of <lb/>
            one another. But one may especially blame a man who <lb/>
            contributes offerings on this account, because such an one <lb/>
            has not only determined to do wrong, but also to co-operate <lb/>
            with others in doing wrong, thinking fit in some things to <lb/>
            be the leader himself, and in others to follow the leadership <lb/>
            of others ; so that, erring both by nature and through what <lb/>
            he has learnt, he leaves himself no good hope of safety, and <lb/>
            this, too, though the law has expressly said that one must <lb/>
            " not follow a multitude to do evil for, in truth, evil is a <lb/>
            very manifold and very fertile thing in the souls of men, but <lb/>
            good is but a contracted and rare thing. Again it is a most <lb/>
            useful recommendation, not to join with many persons to do <lb/>
            evil, but to unite with a few whose chief practice is to do <lb/>
            justly.</p>
          <p>VIII. The fourth and greatest of the accusations, is that <lb/>
            of drunkenness, not slight but excessive drunkenness. For <lb/>
            devotion to crime is equivalent to devotion to swelling up, <lb/>
            and kindling, and inflaming the poison which is the great <lb/>
            cause of folly, namely ignorance, a thing which can never be <lb/>
            extinguished, but which is at all times and in every case <lb/>
            raising a conflagration and fury in the soul. Very naturally, <lb/>
            therefore, justice will follow which purifies every evil <lb/>
            disposition of the mind, for it is said, " Thou shalt utterly <lb/>
            get rid of the wicked man," not out of the city, or out of <lb/>
            the country, or out of the nation, but out of yourselves." † <lb/>
            For there are many faulty and blameable thoughts lurk­ <lb/>
            ing in us, and taking up their abode in the recesses of <lb/>
            our hearts, which, since they are incurable, it is necessary <lb/>
            to eradicate and destroy.</p>
          <p>Therefore it is just that this disobedient and contentious <lb/>
            man, who is always advancing plausible reasons as a sort of <lb/>
            offering and contribution on his part towards the destruction <lb/>
            of what is good, and who is inflamed with strong wine, and <lb/>
            raging in a drunken manner against virtue, and being <lb/>
            absurdly excited to his own injury by wine, should have his <lb/>
            allies for his accusers, his own father and mother, since he <lb/>
            ought to receive every possible reproof and chastisement <lb/>
            from those who can be saved; but of the father and mother <lb/>
            the appellations are common, but their powers are different. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxiii. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxi. 21. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="459"/>
            At all events we shall speak with justice, if we say that the <lb/>
            Creator of the universe is also the father of his creation ; <lb/>
            and that the mother was the knowledge of the Creator with <lb/>
            whom God uniting, not as a man unites, became the father <lb/>
            of creation. And this knowledge having received the seed <lb/>
            of God, when the day of her travail arrived, brought forth <lb/>
            her only and well-beloved son, perceptible by the external <lb/>
            senses, namely this world. Accordingly wisdom is re­ <lb/>
            presented by some one of the beings of the divine company <lb/>
            as speaking of herself in this manner: " God created me as <lb/>
            the first of his works, and before the beginning of time did <lb/>
            he establish me." For it was necessary that all the things <lb/>
            which came under the head of the creation must be younger <lb/>
            than the mother and nurse of the whole universe.</p>
          <p>IX. Who then is able to encounter the accusation of <lb/>
            these parents ? No one can withstand even their moderate <lb/>
            threats, or their very slightest reproach ; for neither is any <lb/>
            one able to contain the immeasurable multitude of their <lb/>
            gifts, perhaps even the whole world is not; but like a <lb/>
            shallow channel, when the great fountain of the bounties of <lb/>
            God flows into it, it will be very speedily filled so as to <lb/>
            overtop its bounds and overflow; but if we are unable to <lb/>
            receive his benefits, how shall we endure his chastising <lb/>
            powers when they come upon us ?</p>
          <p>But these parents of the universe must be taken out of <lb/>
            the present discussion; and for the present let us consider <lb/>
            their pupils and acquaintances who have had assigned to <lb/>
            them the care and superintendence of such souls as are not <lb/>
            unwilling to learn and illiterate. Therefore we say that the <lb/>
            father is masculine and perfect right reason, and that the <lb/>
            mother is that middle and encyclical course of study, and <lb/>
            instruction, and learning, which it is honourable and <lb/>
            advantageous to obey as a child obeys his parents. The <lb/>
            recommendation then of the father, that is of right reason, <lb/>
            is to follow and obey reason, pursuing naked and <lb/>
            undisguised truth; and the injunction of learning, the <lb/>
            mother that is, is to obey the just customs, which ancient <lb/>
            men who embraced opinion, as if it were truth, have <lb/>
            established in cities, and nations, and countries.</p>
          <p>Now these parents have four classes of children. First of <lb/>
            all comes that class which is obedient to them both, the <lb/>
             <pb n="460"/>
            second is that which attends to neither, being the opposite <lb/>
            of the former one. Of the others, each is half perfect. For <lb/>
            the one is exceedingly attached to its father, and attends to <lb/>
            him, but disregards its mother and her injunctions. The <lb/>
            other again appears to be attached to its mother, and obeys <lb/>
            her in everything, but pays but little attention to its father. <lb/>
            The first class, therefore, will carry off the prize of victory <lb/>
            as superior to all the others; the second, which is the <lb/>
            contrary of it, will meet with defeat and destruction" at the <lb/>
            same time ; and as to each of the others they will claim, one <lb/>
            the second prize, and the other the third. The one which is <lb/>
            obedient to its father being the second in honour, and the <lb/>
            one which obeys its mother being the third.</p>
          <p>X. Now of the soul attached to its mother, yielding to the <lb/>
            opinions of the many, and constantly changing its appear­ <lb/>
            ance in accordance with the various forms arising from the <lb/>
            manifold and different ways of life, after the manner of the <lb/>
            Egyptian Proteus, who was able to assume the likeness of <lb/>
            anything in the whole world, and to conceal his real form so <lb/>
            as to render it entirely invisible, the most visible image is <lb/>
            Jothor, a compound of pride, who evidently represents a <lb/>
            city and constitution of men from all quarters, and of all <lb/>
            nations, carried away by vain opinions. For after the wise <lb/>
            Moses had invited the whole people of the soul to observe <lb/>
            piety and to pay the honour due to God, and had taught <lb/>
            them the commandments and the most sacred laws, (for he <lb/>
            says, " When there is a controversy among them and they <lb/>
            come to me, I will decide between them all, and I will bring <lb/>
            together to them the commandments of God and his law.”)* <lb/>
            then Jothor, wise in his own conceit, uninitiated in the <lb/>
            divine blessings, but having principally lived among human <lb/>
            and corruptible things, harangues the people, and proposes <lb/>
            laws contrary to those of nature, having regard only to <lb/>
            opinion, while those other laws are all referrible to the <lb/>
            standard of reality and truth.</p>
          <p>And indeed the prophet, pitying this man and com­ <lb/>
            miserating his exceeding error, thinks it fitting to endeavour <lb/>
            to teach him better things, and to persuade him to change <lb/>
            his ways, and to forsake vain opinions and steadily to follow <lb/>
            the truth. For says he, " We after having cut up and <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xviii. 16. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="461"/>
            eradicated the vain pride of the mind, will leave our abodes <lb/>
            and depart to the place of knowledge, which we shall gain <lb/>
            possession of by the divine oracles and their agreement of <lb/>
            the result with them. Come now with us, and we will do <lb/>
            thee good."* For so doing you will get rid of that most <lb/>
            pernicious thing, false opinion, and you will acquire that <lb/>
            most advantageous thing, truth. But he, being as it were <lb/>
            subdued by enchantment in this way, will neglect what is <lb/>
            said, and will by no means follow any kind of knowledge <lb/>
            whatever, but will retire and will run off to his own <lb/>
            individual and empty pride. For it is said in the scripture <lb/>
            that he replied to him, " I will not go, except to my own <lb/>
            country and to my own race;" that is to say, to his <lb/>
            kindred infidelity imbued with false opinions, since he had <lb/>
            not learnt that true faith which is dear to men.</p>
          <p>XI. For, when desiring to make a display of his piety, he <lb/>
            says, " Now I know that God is a great Lord in comparison <lb/>
            of all gods," t he accuses himself of impiety in the eyes of <lb/>
            all men who are competent to form a judgment; for they <lb/>
            will say to him, " Dost thou now know, 0 impious man, the <lb/>
            power of the Ruler of the universe ? but before this thou <lb/>
            didst not know it. For was there anything which thou <lb/>
            hast ever fallen in with of more antiquity or power than <lb/>
            God ? And are not the virtues of their parents known to <lb/>
            the children before anything else in the world ? And was <lb/>
            not the Ruler of the universe the creator and the father of it ? <lb/>
            So that if you now say that you know it, you do not know it <lb/>
            now, because you did not know it from the beginning of the <lb/>
            creation." And you are not the less convicted of false pre­ <lb/>
            tences, when you profess to compare things that cannot be <lb/>
            compared, and say that you now recognise the greatness and <lb/>
            pre-eminence of God in comparison of all other gods.</p>
          <p>For if thou hadst in real truth known the living God, vou <lb/>
            would never have supposed that there was any other god <lb/>
            endued with independent authority; for as the sun, when <lb/>
            he has arisen, hides the stars, pouring forth his own light al­ <lb/>
            together over our sight, so also when the beams of the light- <lb/>
            giving God, unmingled as they are, and entirely pure, and <lb/>
            visible at the greatest distance, shone upon the eye of the <lb/>
            soul, being comprehensible only by the intellect, then the <note type="footnote"> * Numbers x. 29. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xviii. 11. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="462"/>
            eye of the soul can see nothing else; for the knowledge of <lb/>
            the living God having beamed upon it, out-dazzles everything <lb/>
            else, so that even those things which are most brilliant by <lb/>
            their own intrinsic light appear to be dark in comparison.</p>
          <p>Therefore he would never have ventured to compare the <lb/>
            true and faithful God to those falsely named gods, if he had <lb/>
            really known him ; but ignorance of the one God has caused <lb/>
            him to entertain a belief of many as gods, who have in reality <lb/>
            no existence at all.</p>
          <p>XII. Now this same opinion is entertained by every one <lb/>
            who, having thoroughly comprehended the affairs of the <lb/>
            soul, looks with astonishment on the affairs of the body and <lb/>
            on the things external to the body, diversified as they are <lb/>
            with different colours and forms, in order to deceive the out­ <lb/>
            ward sense, which is easily worked upon. Such a man as <lb/>
            this the lawgiver calls labour, who, not perceiving the true <lb/>
            laws of nature, falsely assents to those which are in force <lb/>
            among men, saying, " it is not the custom in our country to <lb/>
            give the younger daughter in marriage before the elder."* <lb/>
            For he thinks that it behoves him to adhere to the classifica­ <lb/>
            tion arising from the consideration of time, according to <lb/>
            which, that which is oldest is entitled to priority, and after <lb/>
            that, that which is the younger is admitted to a participation <lb/>
            in their joint rights. But the practicer of wisdom, knowing <lb/>
            that natures are not subject to time, desires what is younger <lb/>
            first, and what is older afterwards.</p>
          <p>And moral reason agrees with him in this matter, for it is <lb/>
            necessary for those who practise anything, first of all to come <lb/>
            to the more recent learning, in order that after that, they may <lb/>
            be able to derive advantage from that which is more perfect. <lb/>
            And, on this account, the lovers of virtue and excellence do <lb/>
            not approach the doors of the older philosophy before they <lb/>
            have become familiar with these younger parts of it, grammar, <lb/>
            and geometry, and the whole range of encyclical learning ; <lb/>
            for these subordinate branches do always attend upon those, <lb/>
            who with sincerity and purity of purpose court wisdom. But <lb/>
            he acts cunningly in opposition to these principles, wishing us <lb/>
            to take to ourselves the elder sister first, not in order that <lb/>
            we may have her in a lasting manner, but that being attracted <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxix. 2G. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="463"/>
            by the allurements of the younger, we may hereafter relax in <lb/>
            our desire for the elder one.</p>
          <p>XIII. And we may almost say that this has happened to <lb/>
            many of those who have used out of the way roads to learn­ <lb/>
            ing ; for still, as one may say, men coming from their very <lb/>
            swaddling clothes to the most perfect study and way of life, <lb/>
            philosophy, not thinking it fit to be utterly ignorant of ency­ <lb/>
            clical learning, have still determined to apply themselves to <lb/>
            them late and unwillingly. And then, descending from the <lb/>
            older and more important kinds of learning to the contem­ <lb/>
            plation of the inferior and younger branches, they have <lb/>
            grown old among them so as no longer to be able to return <lb/>
            to those pursuits with which they began.</p>
          <p>It is on this account, I imagine, that he says, " Accomplish <lb/>
            her seven years," which is equivalent to: let not the good <lb/>
            of the soul be unaccomplished by you ; but let it have an <lb/>
            end and a due completion, in order that you may meet with <lb/>
            the younger classification of good things, of which personal <lb/>
            beauty, and glory, and riches, and such things as these <lb/>
            make up the sum. But he does not promise to accomplish <lb/>
            them, but only agrees to fulfil them ; that is to say, studying <lb/>
            never to omit anything which may conduce to its growth and <lb/>
            fulness, but in every instance labouring to get the better of <lb/>
            all his difficulties, even though there may be innumerable <lb/>
            impediments hindering and drawing him in the opposite <lb/>
            direction.</p>
          <p>And the scripture here appears to me to show very plainly, <lb/>
            that customs are regarded by men more than by women, as <lb/>
            is clear by the words of Rachel, who admires only those things <lb/>
            which are perceptible by the outward senses; for she says <lb/>
            to her father, " Be not angry, my lord, that I am unable to <lb/>
            rise up before thee in thy presence, because the custom ot <lb/>
            women is upon me." * Therefore it is especially the conduct <lb/>
            of women to pay regard to customs ; for, indeed, that is the <lb/>
            habit of the weaker and more feminine soul; while the <lb/>
            nature of men, and of that reason which is really vigorous <lb/>
            and masculine, is to be guided by nature.</p>
          <p>XIV. But I marvel at the sincerity and truth of the soul <lb/>
            which, in its conversation, confesses that it is unable to rise <lb/>
            up against apparent good things, and nevertheless admires <lb/>
            and honours every one of them, and all but prefers them to <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxi. 35. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="464"/>
            itself. Since who of us does resist wealth, and who of us <lb/>
            enters the lists against glory ? And who despises honour <lb/>
            or authority, who, I may say, of almost all those who are <lb/>
            still stained by vain opinions ? No one whatever. But as <lb/>
            long as we have none of these things we talk loudly and <lb/>
            proudly, as if we were men of small wants, and companions <lb/>
            of frugality, which renders life all-suffieient for itself, and <lb/>
            just, and suitable for free and nobly born men. But when <lb/>
            there is hope of any of the things which I have enumerated, <lb/>
            or when only the slightest breeze of such hope blows upon <lb/>
            us, then we are found out, for we at once yield, and submit, <lb/>
            and are unable to hold out or resist; and being betrayed by <lb/>
            the outward senses, which are so dear to us, we abandon the <lb/>
            whole allianee of the soul, and we desert not in a concealed <lb/>
            manner, but openly and undisguisedly. And perhaps this <lb/>
            is not more than is reasonable to expeet.</p>
          <p>For the customs of women are still predominant in us,while <lb/>
            we are not as yet able to wash them off, or to rise and eross <lb/>
            over to the hearth of the men's chamber, as is related of the <lb/>
            mind which loved virtue, by name Sarah ; for she is represented <lb/>
            in the sacred oraeles as having eeased to be influeneed by the <lb/>
            customs of women,* when she was about to be in travail and <lb/>
            to bring forth the self-taught offspring, being by name Isaae. <lb/>
            And he is said not to have had a mother, having received the <lb/>
            inheritance of relationship from her father only, and not from <lb/>
            her mother, having no share in the female race; for some <lb/>
            one has said somewhere, " And yet, in truth, she is my <lb/>
            sister, the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of <lb/>
            my mother."t For she is not formed of the material per­ <lb/>
            eeptible by the outward senses, which is always in a state of <lb/>
            formation or of dissolution, which is called the mother, and <lb/>
            nurse and bringer up of created things; among which, first <lb/>
            of all, the tree of wisdom sprang up, but rather of the eause <lb/>
            and father of all. She, therefore, having emerged out of the <lb/>
            whole eorporeal world, and exulting from the joy which is in <lb/>
            God, laughs at the pursuits of men, whieh are conversant <lb/>
            about either war or peace.</p>
          <p>XV. We, then, being overcome by the unmanly and <lb/>
            woman-like association with the outward senses, and the <lb/>
            passions, and the objects of the outward senses, are not able <lb/>
            to stand up in opposition to anything that is apparent. But <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 11. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xx. 12. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="465"/>
            are dragged on, some of us, in spite of ourselves, and <lb/>
            others of us willingly, by everything which comes across us ; <lb/>
            and if our army, not being able to execute the commands of <lb/>
            the father, were to yield, it would nevertheless have for an <lb/>
            ally its mother, moderate learning, which enacts in different <lb/>
            cities such laws as are in common use, and appear to be just, <lb/>
            and establishes different institutions in different countries.</p>
          <p>But there are some persons who, neglecting the precepts <lb/>
            of their mothers, adhere with all their might to the injunc­ <lb/>
            tions of their fathers, whom right reason has thought worthy <lb/>
            of the greatest honour, namely, of the priesthood; and if we <lb/>
            go through their actions, by which they have obtained this <lb/>
            honour, we shall perhaps incur the ridicule of many, who are <lb/>
            deceived by the first appearances which present themselves <lb/>
            to them, and who do not perceive those powers which are <lb/>
            invisible and kept in the shade. For those who have applied <lb/>
            themselves to prayers and sacrifices, and the whole body of <lb/>
            ceremonies connected with the temple, are, what seems a <lb/>
            most paradoxical thing, homicides, fratricides, murderers of <lb/>
            those persons who are nearest and dearest to them, though <lb/>
            they ought to be pure, and sprung from the pure, having no <lb/>
            connection with any pollution, intentionally incurred, nay, <lb/>
            not even unintentionally. For it is said, " Each of you slay <lb/>
            his brother, and each of you slay his neighbour, and each of <lb/>
            you slay his nearest relations. And the sons of Levi did as <lb/>
            Moses had spoken ; and there fell of the people in that day <lb/>
            about three thousand men.”* And those who had slain such <lb/>
            a vast multitude he praises, saying, " Ye have this day, each <lb/>
            of you, filled your hands to the Lord in your son, or your <lb/>
            brother, so that blessing shall be given to you."</p>
          <p>XVI. What, then, are we to say, but that such men are <lb/>
            caught by the common customs of men, having, as their <lb/>
            accuser, their mother, who lives according to the laws of the <lb/>
            state, and acts like a demagogue, namely, custom: but that <lb/>
            the others preserve the laws of nature, having, for their ally, <lb/>
            their father, namely, right reason ; for it is not the case, as <lb/>
            some persons think, that the priests slay men, rational ani­ <lb/>
            mals, compounded of soul and body, but they only eradicate <lb/>
            from their minds all those things which are akin to and dear <lb/>
            to the flesh, thinking it seemly for those who have become <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxii. 27. </note> <note type="footnote"> II II </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="466"/>
            ministers of the only wise God, to alienate themselves from <lb/>
            all the things of creation, and to look upon all such things <lb/>
            as enemies and thoroughly hostile.</p>
          <p>On this account it is, that we shall slay a brother, not a <lb/>
            man, but the body, which is brother to the soul; that <lb/>
            is to say, we shall separate that which is devoted to the <lb/>
            passions and mortal, from that which is devoted to virtue and <lb/>
            divine. And, again, we shall slay a neighbour, not a man, <lb/>
            but a company and a band ; for such a company is, at the <lb/>
            same time, akin to, and hostile to, the soul, laying baits and <lb/>
            spreading snares for it, in order that being inundated by the <lb/>
            objects of the outward senses, which overflow it, it may never <lb/>
            emerge and look up to heaven, so as to embrace the beautiful <lb/>
            and God-like natures. And we shall also slay those nearest <lb/>
            to us: but that which is nearest to the mind is uttered <lb/>
            speech, inserting false opinions among reasonable and natu­ <lb/>
            ral plausibilities and probabilities, to the destruction of that <lb/>
            best of all possessions, truth.</p>
          <p>XVII. Why, then, are we not also to repel this being, too, <lb/>
            who is a sophist and a polluted person, condemning him to <lb/>
            the death which is suited to him, namely, silence (for silence <lb/>
            is the death of speech), in order that the mind may be no <lb/>
            longer led away by its sophisms, but being completely eman­ <lb/>
            cipated from all the pleasures which are according to the <lb/>
            body, " the brother," and being alienated from, and having <lb/>
            shaken off the yoke of, all the trickeries according to " the <lb/>
            neighbour," and the neighbouring outward senses, and from <lb/>
            the sophistries in accordance with the " nearest " speech, <lb/>
            may be able, in all purity, to apply itself to all the proper <lb/>
            objects of the intellect.</p>
          <p>This is he "who says to his father and to his mother," his <lb/>
            mortal parents, " I have not seen you," ever since I have <lb/>
            beheld the things of God, who " does not recognize his sons," <lb/>
            ever since he has become an acquaintance of wisdom, who <lb/>
            " disowns his brethren,"* ever since he has ceased to be dis­ <lb/>
            owned by God, and has been thought worthy of perfect sal­ <lb/>
            vation. This is he who took as coadjutor," that is to say, <lb/>
            who searched for and sought out the things of corruptible <lb/>
            creation, ot which the chief happiness is laid up in eating <lb/>
            and drinking, and who went, Moses says, "to the chimney," <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxiii. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="467"/>
            which was burning and flaming with the excesses of wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, and which could never be extinguished, namely, the <lb/>
            life of man, and who, after that, was able even to pierce the <lb/>
            woman through her belly,* because she appeared to be the <lb/>
            cause of bringing forth, being, in real truth, rather the <lb/>
            patient than the agent, and even every " man," and every <lb/>
            reasoning which follows the opinion which attributes passions <lb/>
            to the essence of God, who is the cause of all things.</p>
          <p>XYIII. Will not this person be justly looked upon as a <lb/>
            murderer, by many who are influenced by the customs which <lb/>
            have so much weight among women ? But with God, the <lb/>
            ruler and father of the universe, he will be thought worthy <lb/>
            of infinite praises and panegyrics, and of rewards which can <lb/>
            never be taken away; and the rewards are great, and akin <lb/>
            to one another, being peace and the priesthood: for it was <lb/>
            an illustrious achievement, after having put to flight the <lb/>
            almost invincible troops of men who live according to the <lb/>
            common fashion, and having put down the civil war of the <lb/>
            appetites in the soul, to establish a peace firmly; and for <lb/>
            this great exploit to receive nothing else, not riches, not <lb/>
            glory, not honour, not authority, not beauty, not strength, <lb/>
            not any of the advantages of the body, nor, on the other <lb/>
            hand, earth or heaven, or all the world, but that most im­ <lb/>
            portant and valuable of all things, the rank of the priest­ <lb/>
            hood, the office of serving and paying honour to Him who <lb/>
            is in truth the only being worthy of honour and service ; this <lb/>
            is an admirable thing, an object worthy of contention.</p>
          <p>And I was not wrong when I called those rewards, brothers <lb/>
            to one another, but I said so, knowing that he cannot be <lb/>
            made a true priest who is still serving in human and mortal <lb/>
            warfare, in which vain opinions are the officers of the com­ <lb/>
            panies ; and that he cannot be a peaceful man, who does not <lb/>
            in sincerity cultivate and serve, with all simplicity, the only <lb/>
            Being who has no share in warfare, and everlasting peace.</p>
          <p>XIX. Such are the persons who honour their father, and <lb/>
            the things belonging to their father, but who pay but little <lb/>
            regard to their mother and to things that belong to her. <lb/>
            But Moses represents the man who is at variance with both <lb/>
            his father and his mother, and brings them forward as saying, <lb/>
            " I know not the Lord; and I will not let Israel go.”† For <note type="footnote"> * N umbers xxv. 8. </note> <note type="footnote"> + Exodus v. 2. </note> <note type="footnote"> H 11 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="468"/>
            he appears to put himself in opposition to those divine things, <lb/>
            which are established in accordance with divine reason, and <lb/>
            also to those which are established with reference to created <lb/>
            beings, by means of education, and to be throwing everything <lb/>
            into confusion in every direction. And there are even now­ <lb/>
            for the human race has not as yet entirely purified itself <lb/>
            from unmixed wickedness-there are still persons who have <lb/>
            absolutely determined to do nothing which has any bearing <lb/>
            on piety or on human society, but who, on the contrary, are <lb/>
            the companions of impiety and atheism, and treacherous <lb/>
            towards their equals.</p>
          <p>And these men go about, being the greatest imaginable <lb/>
            pests of their cities, out of curiosity and a love of interfering, <lb/>
            mixing themselves up with, or rather, if one must tell the <lb/>
            truth, throwing into confusion all kinds of affairs, both public <lb/>
            and private, men who ought to have put up prayers and <lb/>
            offered sacrifices to avert (as if it had been a great disease) <lb/>
            famine, or pestilence, or any other evil inflicted by God; for <lb/>
            these calamities are great evils to those on whom they fall; <lb/>
            in reference to which Moses sings their destruction, when <lb/>
            they have been destroyed by their own allies, and swal­ <lb/>
            lowed up by their own opinions, as if by the waves of a <lb/>
            stormy sea.</p>
          <p>XX. Let us now, therefore, proceeding in regular order, <lb/>
            speak of the enemies of these persons, men who honour <lb/>
            instruction and right reason, among whom are those who are <lb/>
            attached to the virtue of one of their parents, being half- <lb/>
            perfect companions; these men are the most excellent <lb/>
            guardians of the laws which the father, that is to say, right <lb/>
            reason, established, and faithful stewards of the customs <lb/>
            which education, their mother, instituted; and they were <lb/>
            instructed by right reason, their father, to honour the Father <lb/>
            of the universe, and not to neglect the customs and laws <lb/>
            established by education, their mother, and considered by all <lb/>
            men to be founded in justice.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, Jacob, the practiser of virtue, and the <lb/>
            man who entered into the lists of, and was a candidate for, <lb/>
            the prizes of virtue, was inclined to give his ears in exchange <lb/>
            for his eyes, and words for actions, and improvements for <lb/>
            perfection, as the bounteous God was willing to give eyes <lb/>
            to his mind, in order that he might for the future clearly see <lb/>
             <pb n="469"/>
            what hitherto he had only comprehended by hearing (for <lb/>
            the eyes are more trustworthy than the ears), the oracle <lb/>
            sounded in his ears, " Thy name shall not be called Jacob ; <lb/>
            but Israel shall thy name be, because thou hast prevailed <lb/>
            with God and with men, with power."* Jacob then is the <lb/>
            name of learning and of improvement, that is to say of those <lb/>
            powers which depend upon learning, and Israel is the name <lb/>
            of perfection, for the name being interpreted means " the <lb/>
            sight of God; " and what can be more perfect among all the <lb/>
            virtues than the sight of the only living God ? Accordingly <lb/>
            he who hath seen this good thing is confessed to be good by <lb/>
            both his parents, having attained to strength in God and <lb/>
            power both before the Lord and before men.</p>
          <p>And it appears to me to be very well said in the book of <lb/>
            Proverbs, " Men who see what is right before God and before <lb/>
            men.”† Since it is by the aid of both these that men attain <lb/>
            to the complete possesssion of good. For when you have <lb/>
            been taught to observe the laws of your Father, ‡ and not to <lb/>
            disregard the injunctions of your mother, you will be able <lb/>
            to say with confidence and pride, " For I also was born a son, <lb/>
            subject to my father, and beloved before the face of my <lb/>
            " mother.”</p>
          <p>XXI. But, I should say to this man, were you not fated <lb/>
            to be loved, if you kept the laws established among mortals <lb/>
            out of a desire for fellowship, and if you paid due respect <lb/>
            to the ordinances of the uncreate God out of a love for, and <lb/>
            a desire to exhibit piety ? Therefore Moses, the divine <lb/>
            prophet of God, in his description of the building of the <lb/>
            temple, shows the perfection of the temple in both points ; <lb/>
            for it is not without due consideration for us that he covers <lb/>
            the ark both within and without with gold, or that he gives <lb/>
            two robes to the chief priest, or that he builds two altars, <lb/>
            one outside the tabernacle for the victims, and the other <lb/>
            inside for the burning incense; but he does this, wishing by <lb/>
            these emblems to exhibit the virtues of each species; for <lb/>
            it is fitting that the wise man should be adorned both with <lb/>
            the invisible excelrences existing within in the soul, and also <lb/>
            with those external ones which are outwardly visible, and <lb/>
            with prudence which is more valuable than gold.</p>
          <p>And whenever it departs from human studies, worshipping <note type="footnote">* Genesis xxxii. 28.</note><note type="footnote"> + Proverbs iii. 4. </note><note type="footnote"> ‡ Proverbs iv. 3. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="470"/>
            the living God alone, it puts on the simple unvaried robe of <lb/>
            truth, which no mortal thing can ever touch, for it is made <lb/>
            of linen material, a material not produced from any being <lb/>
            whose nature it is to die. But whenever it passes over to <lb/>
            mix in political affairs, then it lays aside the man's robe and <lb/>
            assumes the other embroidered one of a most admirable <lb/>
            beauty to look at; for life being a thing of great variety <lb/>
            and of great changes, requires the diversified wisdom of the <lb/>
            pilot who is to hold the helm; and he will appear in the <lb/>
            outer conspicuous altar of life to exercise abundant prudence <lb/>
            with respect to the skin, and flesh, and blood, and everything <lb/>
            relating to the body, in order not to offend the common <lb/>
            multitude which gives the second place in honour to the <lb/>
            good things of the body in close proximity to the good <lb/>
            things of the soul; and at the inner altar he will use blood­ <lb/>
            less, fleshless, incorporeal things, things proceeding from rea­ <lb/>
            soning alone, which are compared to frankincense and other <lb/>
            burnt spices; for as these fill the nostrils, so do those fill <lb/>
            the whole region of the soul with fragrance.</p>
          <p>XXII. We must also not be ignorant that wisdom, being <lb/>
            the art of arts, appears to vary according to its different <lb/>
            materials, but it shows its true species without alteration to <lb/>
            those who have acute sight, and who are not carried away <lb/>
            by the burden of the body with which they are surrounded: <lb/>
            but who see the impression which is stamped upon it by art <lb/>
            itself. They say that Phidias, the clebrated statuary, made <lb/>
            statues of brass, and of ivory, and of gold, and of other <lb/>
            different materials, and that in all these works he displayed <lb/>
            one and the same art, so that not only good judges, but even <lb/>
            those who had no pretensions to the title, recognized the <lb/>
            artist from his works. For, as in the case of twins, nature <lb/>
            having often employed the same character, has produced <lb/>
            similitudes very slightly indeed differing from one another; <lb/>
            in the same manner perfect art, being the imitation and copy <lb/>
            of nature, when it has taken different materials, fashions and <lb/>
            stamps the same appearance on all, so that the works pro­ <lb/>
            duced by her are in the highest possible degree kindred, <lb/>
            and brother-like, and twins.</p>
          <p>And the power which exists in the wise man will show <lb/>
            the same result: for when it is occupied with the affairs of <lb/>
            the living God it is called piety and holiness: but when it <lb/>
             <pb n="471"/>
            employs itself upon the heaven, and the things in heaven, <lb/>
            it is natural philosophy; and when it devotes itself to the <lb/>
            investigation of the air, and of the different circumstances <lb/>
            attending its variations and changes, whether taking place <lb/>
            in the uniform yearly revolutions of the seasons, or in the <lb/>
            partial periods of months and days, it is then called meteor­ <lb/>
            ology. It is called moral philosophy when it busies itself <lb/>
            about the rectification of human morals; and this moral <lb/>
            philosophy is divided into several subordinate species ; that <lb/>
            namely of politics, when occupied about state affairs; eco­ <lb/>
            nomy, when applied to the management of a household; when <lb/>
            it is devoted to the subject of banquets and entertainments, <lb/>
            it is then convivial philosophy.</p>
          <p>Again, that power which concerns itself about the govern­ <lb/>
            ment of men, is royal; that which is conversant with com­ <lb/>
            mands and prohibitions, is legislative. For all these different <lb/>
            powers the wise man of many names and many celebrities <lb/>
            does truly contain within himself, namely, piety, holiness, <lb/>
            natural philosophy, meteorology, moral philosophy, political <lb/>
            knowledge, economy, royal power, legislative wisdom, and <lb/>
            innumerable other faculties; and in every one of them he <lb/>
            will be seen to wear one and the same appearance.</p>
          <p>XXIII. But now that we have discussed the four dif­ <lb/>
            ferent classes of children, we must beware not to overlook <lb/>
            this, which, may be the most excellent proof of this partition <lb/>
            and division of the chapter; for when a child is elated and <lb/>
            puffed up by folly, his parents accuse him in this manner, <lb/>
            saying, " This is our son,"* pointing to the disobedient and <lb/>
            stiff-necked youth; for by the demonstration " this," they <lb/>
            show that they have other sons likewise, some of whom <lb/>
            obey one of them, and others of whom obey them both, <lb/>
            being well-disposed reasonings, of whom Reuben is an ex­ <lb/>
            ample ; others again, who are fond of hearing and learning, <lb/>
            of whom Simeon is a specimen, for his name, being inter­ <lb/>
            preted, means " hearing;" others, people who fly to and <lb/>
            become suppliants of God, this is the company of the <lb/>
            Levites; others singing a song of gratitude, not so much <lb/>
            with a loud voice as with the mind, of whom Judah is the <lb/>
            leader; others, who have been thought worthy of rewards <lb/>
            and presents, on account of their voluntary acquisition of <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxi. 19. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="472"/>
            virtue through labour, like Issachar; others, persons who <lb/>
            have abandoned the Chaldæan meteorological speculations, <lb/>
            and passed over to the contemplation of the uncreate God, <lb/>
            like Abraham; some, who have attained to self-taught and <lb/>
            spontaneous virtue, like Isaac; some, full of wisdom and <lb/>
            strength, and beloved by God, like the most perfect Moses.</p>
          <p>XXIV. Very naturally, therefore, the sacred law com­ <lb/>
            mands the disobedient and contentious man—who brings <lb/>
            contributions of evil, that is to say, who joins together and <lb/>
            heaps up sin upon sin, great crimes on little ones, fresh <lb/>
            guilt upon ancient, intentional upon involuntary misdeeds; <lb/>
            and who, like a person inflamed by wine, is always intoxi­ <lb/>
            cated and drunk, and raging with ceaseless and unrestrained <lb/>
            drunkenness, during the whole of his life-to be stoned; be­ <lb/>
            cause he has drunk of the unmixed and abundant cup of <lb/>
            folly, and because he has destroyed the injunctions of right <lb/>
            reason, his father, and the legitimate expositions of his <lb/>
            mother's instruction. And though he had an example of <lb/>
            excellence and virtue in his brothers, who were approved of <lb/>
            by his parents, he did not imitate their virtue, but, on the <lb/>
            contrary, he thought fit to go to an additional length in his <lb/>
            transgressions, so as to make a god of the body, and to <lb/>
            make a god of Typhus, who is especially honoured among <lb/>
            the Egyptians, the emblem of whom was the figure of a <lb/>
            golden bull; around which his mad worshippers establish <lb/>
            dances, and sing, and prelude, not with such melodies as arc <lb/>
            redolent of wine and revelry, like the sweet songs sung at <lb/>
            feasts and entertainments, but a really melancholy and <lb/>
            mournful lamentation, like men intoxicated, who have re­ <lb/>
            laxed and quite destroyed the tone and energy of the soul.</p>
          <p>For it is said, that when Joshua heard the people crying <lb/>
            out he said to Moses, " There is the sound of war in the <lb/>
            camp. And he said, It is not the voice of men beginning <lb/>
            to exert themselves in battle, nor is it the voice of men <lb/>
            betaking themselves to flight, but it is the voice of men <lb/>
            beginning revelry and drunkenness that I hear: and when <lb/>
            he came near to the camp he saw the calf and the dances."* <lb/>
            And the enigmatical meaning, which is concealed under <lb/>
            these figurative expressions, we will explain to the best of <lb/>
            our ability. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxii. 17. </note> <pb n="473"/>
            </p>
          <p>XXV. Our own affairs are at one time in a state of tran­ <lb/>
            quillity, and at another they behave as it were with un­ <lb/>
            seasonable impetuosity and loud cries ; and their tranquillity <lb/>
            is profound peace, and their condition, when in an opposite <lb/>
            state, is interminable war ; and the witness to this fact is <lb/>
            one who has experienced its truth, and who cannot lie; for <lb/>
            having heard the voice of the people crying out, he says <lb/>
            to the manager and superintendent of the affairs, " There is <lb/>
            a sound of war in the tent;" for as long as the irrational <lb/>
            impulses were not stirred up, and had not raised any outcry <lb/>
            in us, our minds were established with some firmness; but <lb/>
            when they began to fill the place of the soul with all sorts <lb/>
            of voices and sounds, calling together and awakening the <lb/>
            passions, they created a civil sedition and war in the camp. <lb/>
            Very naturally, for where else should there be strife, and <lb/>
            battle, and contention, and all the other deeds of intermin­ <lb/>
            able war, except in the life according to the body, which he, <lb/>
            speaking allegorically, calls the camp ? This life the mind <lb/>
            is accustomed to leave, when under the influence of God it <lb/>
            approaches the living God, contemplating the incorporeal <lb/>
            appearances; “for Moses,” says the scripture, " having <lb/>
            taken his own tent, fixed it outside the camp," and that <lb/>
            too not near it, but a long way off, and at a great distance <lb/>
            from the camp. And by these statements he tells its, figu­ <lb/>
            ratively, that the wise man is but a sojourner, and a person <lb/>
            who leaves war and goes over to peace, and who passes from <lb/>
            the mortal and disturbed camp to the undisturbed and <lb/>
            peaceful and divine life of rational and happy souls.</p>
          <p>XXVI. And he says in another passage that, " When I <lb/>
            have gone out of the city I will stretch forth my hands unto <lb/>
            the Lord, and the voices shall cease." t Think not here <lb/>
            that he who is speaking is a man, a contexture, or composi­ <lb/>
            tion, or combination of soul and body, or whatever else you <lb/>
            may choose to call this concrete animal; but rather the <lb/>
            purest and most unalloyed mind, which, while contained in <lb/>
            the city of the body and of mortal life is cramped and con­ <lb/>
            fined, and like a man who is bound in prison confesses <lb/>
            plainly that he is unable to relish the free air. But as soon <lb/>
            as it has escaped from this city, then being released, as to its <lb/>
            thoughts and imaginations, as prisoners are loosened as to <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xxxiii. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus is. 29. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="474"/>
            their hands and feet, it will put forth its energies in their <lb/>
            free, and emancipated, and unrestrained strength, so that the <lb/>
            commands of the passions will be at once put an end to.</p>
          <p>Are not the outcries of pleasure very loud with which she <lb/>
            is accustomed to deliver such commands as please her ? <lb/>
            And is not the voice of appetite unwearied when she pours <lb/>
            forth her bitter threats against those who do not serve her ? <lb/>
            And so again all the other passions have a voice of loud and <lb/>
            varied sound. But even, if each one of the passions were to <lb/>
            exert the ten thousand mouths and voices, and all the power <lb/>
            of making an uproar spoken of by poets, it would not be <lb/>
            able to perplex the ears of the perfect man, after he has <lb/>
            already passed from them, and determined no longer to dwell <lb/>
            in the same city with them.</p>
          <p>XXVII. But the sacred Scriptures agree with the man <lb/>
            who can speak from experience, when he says that in the <lb/>
            camp of the body all the sounds of war were heard, the <lb/>
            tranquillity dear to peace having been driven to a distance. <lb/>
            For he does not say that it is not such a shout of war, but <lb/>
            that it is not such a shout as some persons think the <lb/>
            cry of men who have conquered or who have been con­ <lb/>
            quered to be, but rather such an one as would proceed from <lb/>
            men heavy and overwhelmed with wine. For the expression, <lb/>
            " It is not the voice of men beginning to exert themselves in <lb/>
            battle," is equivalent to the words, " of men who have got <lb/>
            the better in war," for exertion in battle is the cause of <lb/>
            victory.</p>
          <p>Thuslie represents the wise Abraham, after the destruction <lb/>
            of the nine kings, that is, of the four passions and the five <lb/>
            powers of the outward senses, which were all set in <lb/>
            motion in a manner contrary to nature, preluding with a <lb/>
            hymn of gratitude, and saying, " I will stretch forth my <lb/>
            hand to the most high God, who made heaven and earth; <lb/>
            that I will not take from a thread even to a shoe-latchet of any <lb/>
            thing that is thine." * And he means, as it appears to me, <lb/>
            by this expression, everything in the world, the heaven, <lb/>
            the earth, the water, the air, and all animals, and all plants.</p>
          <p>For to every one of them, he who directs all the energies <lb/>
            of his soul towards God, and who looks to him alone as <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xiv. 22. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="475"/>
            the only source from which he can hope for advantage, <lb/>
            may fitly say—I will take nothing that is yours; I will <lb/>
            not receive from the sun the light of day, nor by night will <lb/>
            I receive light from the moon or from the other <lb/>
            stars, nor rain from the air and from the clouds, nor meat <lb/>
            and drink from'the earth and from the water, nor the <lb/>
            power of sight from the eyes, nor the faculty of hearing <lb/>
            from the ears, nor that of smelling from the nostrils, nor <lb/>
            from the palate in the mouth the sense of taste, nor the <lb/>
            faculty of speaking from the tongue, nor the power of <lb/>
            giving and taking from the hands, nor that of approaching <lb/>
            and of retreating from the feet, nor that of breathing from <lb/>
            the lungs, nor that of digesting from the liver, nor from <lb/>
            the other internal organs of the body the power of exciting <lb/>
            the energies which belong to them, nor the yearly produce <lb/>
            from trees and seeds ; but I will look upon every thing as <lb/>
            proceeding from the only wise God, who extends his own <lb/>
            beneficial powers in every direction, and who by their agency <lb/>
            benefits me.</p>
          <p>XXVII. He then who can thus look upon the living God, <lb/>
            and who thus comprehends the nature of the cause of all <lb/>
            things, honours the things of which he is the cause in a second­ <lb/>
            ary degree to himself; while at the same time he confesses <lb/>
            their importance though without flattering them. And this <lb/>
            confession is most just: I will receive nothing from you, but <lb/>
            everything from God, to whom all things belong, though <lb/>
            perhaps the benefits may be bestowed through the medium <lb/>
            of you; for ye are instruments to minister to his everlasting <lb/>
            graces. But man, who is devoid of any consideration, who <lb/>
            is blinded as to his mind, by which alone the living God is <lb/>
            comprehensible, does, by means of that mind, never see any­ <lb/>
            thing anywhere, but sees all the bodies which are in the <lb/>
            world by his own outward senses, which he looks upon as <lb/>
            the causes of all things which exist.</p>
          <p>On which account, beginning to make gods for himself, he <lb/>
            has filled the world with images and statues, and innumer­ <lb/>
            able other representations, made out of all kinds of different <lb/>
            materials, fashioned by painters and statuaries, whom the law­ <lb/>
            giver banished to a distance from his state, proposing both <lb/>
            publicly and privately great rewards and surpassing honours <lb/>
            to them, by which conduct he has brought about a contrary <lb/>
             <pb n="476"/>
            result to that which he intended, namely, impiety instead of <lb/>
            religion. For the worship of many gods in the souls of <lb/>
            ignorant people is mere impiety ; and they who deify mortal <lb/>
            things neglect the honour due to God ; who are not content <lb/>
            with making images of the sun and of the moon to the extent <lb/>
            of their inclination, and of all the earth, and of all the water, <lb/>
            but they even gave beasts and plants devoid of reason a share <lb/>
            in those honours, which belonged of right only to immortal <lb/>
            beings. And he, reproving them, began a song of victory as <lb/>
            has here been shown.</p>
          <p>XXIX. And Moses indeed, in the same manner, when he <lb/>
            saw the king of Eygpt,* that arrogant man with his six <lb/>
            hundred chariots, that is to say, with the six carefully <lb/>
            arranged motions of the organic body, and with the governors <lb/>
            who were appointed to manage them, who, while none of all <lb/>
            created things are by nature calculated to stand still, think <lb/>
            nevertheless that they may look upon everything as solidly <lb/>
            settled and admitting of no alteration ; when he, I say, saw <lb/>
            that this lung had met with the punishment due to his <lb/>
            impiety, and that the people who were practisers of virtue,had <lb/>
            escaped from the attacks of their enemies, and had been saved <lb/>
            by mighty power beyond their expectation, he then sang a <lb/>
            hymn to God as a just and true judge, beginning a hymn in <lb/>
            a manner most becoming and most exactly suited to the <lb/>
            events that had happened, because the horse and his rider he <lb/>
            had thrown into the sea t having utterly destroyed that <lb/>
            mind which rode upon the irrational impulses of that four- <lb/>
            footed and restive animal, passion, and had become an ally, and <lb/>
            defender, and protector of the seeing soul, so as to bestow <lb/>
            upon it complete safety.</p>
          <p>And the same prophet begins a song to the well, not only <lb/>
            for the destruction of the passions, but also because he has <lb/>
            had strength given to him to acquire the most valuable of all <lb/>
            posessions, namely incomparable wisdom, which he compares <lb/>
            to a well; for it is deep, and not superficial, giving forth a <lb/>
            sweet stream to souls who thirst for goodness and virtue, a <lb/>
            drink at once most necessary and most sweet.</p>
          <p>But it is not entrusted to any person who is not initiated <lb/>
            in wisdom to dig this well. but only to kings, on which <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xiv. 7. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Exodus xv. 4. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="477"/>
            account it is said, “Kings hewed it out of stone."* For it <lb/>
            is the office of mighty rulers to investigate and to establish <lb/>
            wisdom, not meaning those who with their arms have <lb/>
            subdued sea and land, but those who with the powers of the <lb/>
            soul have fought against and subdued its diversified, and <lb/>
            mingled, and confused multitude.</p>
          <p>XXX. Now the pupils and followers of these persons are <lb/>
            those who say, " Thy sons have taken the sum of the men of <lb/>
            war who are under our charge, and there is not one of them <lb/>
            who has refused, but each man has brought his gift to the <lb/>
            Lord of that which he has found." t For these men are <lb/>
            likely again to prelude with a song of triumph, being eager <lb/>
            to attain to perfect and dominant powers. For they say <lb/>
            that the man who has taken the sum of the whole, has also <lb/>
            taken the greatest number of the reasons of courage, which <lb/>
            are by nature inclined to war, being arrayed in opposition <lb/>
            to two squadrons, one of which is led by cowardice, which <lb/>
            is difficult to overtake, and the other by frantic temerity and <lb/>
            rashness ; and neither of them has any share in sound <lb/>
            wisdom.</p>
          <p>And it is very admirably said that no one refused, by <lb/>
            way of intimating a participation in perfect and complete <lb/>
            courage ; just as the lyre and any other musical instrument <lb/>
            is out of tune, if there is one single discordant note in it ; <lb/>
            but is in tune when the strings are all harmonious and pour <lb/>
            forth the same symphony at one touch. In the same <lb/>
            manner also, the instrument of the soul is out of tune when <lb/>
            it is either strained by rashness and urged on to a degree <lb/>
            of exceeding sharpness, or relaxed by cowardice in an <lb/>
            immoderate degree, so as to be let down and become very <lb/>
            flat. But it is in tune when all the tones of courage and of <lb/>
            every virtue are well united and combined together, and so <lb/>
            produce one well-arranged melody. And it is a great proof <lb/>
            of good tune and of skilful management to bring his due gift <lb/>
            to God; and this is to honour the living God in a becoming <lb/>
            manner, by means of confessing most distinctly that this <lb/>
            whole universe is his gift to us; for he says in, strictest <lb/>
            accordance with natural truth, " the man has brought the <lb/>
            gift which he found." But everyone of us, the moment that he <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xxi. 18. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Numbers xxxi. 49. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="478"/>
            is born, finds the great gift of God, namely the universal <lb/>
            world, which he has given to him, and to the most excellent <lb/>
            parts of him.*</p>
          <p>XXXI. There are also particular gifts which it is suitable <lb/>
            both to God to give, and to men to receive. And these <lb/>
            must be the virtues and the energies in accordance with <lb/>
            them, at the discovery of which, being almost without any <lb/>
            connexion with time, by reason of the surpassing rapidity of <lb/>
            the giver which he is accustomed to exhibit in his gifts, every <lb/>
            one is full of admiration, even those to whom nothing else in <lb/>
            the world appears great. On which account also, the <lb/>
            question is put, " How didst thou find it so quickly, 0 my <lb/>
            son ? ”† the questioner marvelling at the promptness of the <lb/>
            virtuous disposition; and he who has received the benefit <lb/>
            answers felicitously, " Because the Lord God gave it to me." <lb/>
            For the gifts and explanations of men are slow, but those of <lb/>
            God are most rapid, outstripping the motion of even the <lb/>
            most speedy time.</p>
          <p>Therefore those who by their strength and courage have <lb/>
            become chiefs and leaders of the chorus which raises the song <lb/>
            of triumph and of gratitude, are those who have been already <lb/>
            mentioned ; but those who, by reason of having been put to <lb/>
            flight, and of their weakness, are companions of the song of <lb/>
            lamentation which is raised on occasion of defeat, are men <lb/>
            whom one ought to look upon as cowards, rather than to <lb/>
            pity ; like those who have a body labouring under some <lb/>
            natural defect, to whom any ordinary occasion of sickness is <lb/>
            a great hindrance to their cure. But some persons have <lb/>
            succumbed contrary to their inclinations, not because the <lb/>
            energies of their souls are more effeminate, but because they <lb/>
            have been overwhelmed by the more vigorous strength of <lb/>
            their adversaries ; and imitating those who are willing slaves, <lb/>
            they have voluntarily cast themselves down before either <lb/>
            masters, though they were freemen by birth ; on which <lb/>
            account being unable to be sold they have, which is the most <lb/>
            incredible of all things, bought masters for themselves and <lb/>
            so become slaves, doing the very same thing with those who <lb/>
            are insatiably eager for drunkenness with wine; for they <note type="footnote"> * This passage is certainly corrupt. Markland thinks that some <lb/>
            words at least have been lost. </note><note type="footnote"> t Genesis xxvii. 20. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="479"/>
            also of their own free will and without any compulsion, <lb/>
            drink unmixed wine, so that of their own accord they <lb/>
            eradicate sobriety from their souls, and choose folly; for, <lb/>
            says the scripture, " I hear the voice of those who are <lb/>
            beginning revelry and drunkenness;" that is to say, of <lb/>
            men who are exhibiting a madness which is not involun­ <lb/>
            tary, but who injure themselves with a voluntary and <lb/>
            deliberate frenzy.</p>
          <p>XXXII. And every one who comes near the camp sees <lb/>
            the calf and the dances, and he himself also is soon infected. <lb/>
            For we fall in with Typhus and the revellers of Typhus, when­ <lb/>
            ever we deliberately purpose to come near to the camp of the <lb/>
            body; since those who are fond of contemplation and are <lb/>
            eager to see incorporeal objects, as being persons who practise <lb/>
            obstinacy from pride, are accustomed to dwell at a distance <lb/>
            from the body.</p>
          <p>Do then therefore pray to God never to begin revelry or <lb/>
            drunkenness, that is to say, never intentionally to set forth <lb/>
            in the road which leads to ignorance and folly; for unin­ <lb/>
            tentional errors are as light again as deliberate sins, inasmuch <lb/>
            as they are not weighed down by the irresistible conviction of <lb/>
            conscience.</p>
          <p>And when your prayers have been accomplished, you will <lb/>
            no longer be able to remain in ignorance or out of office, but <lb/>
            you will acquire the most important of all offices, namely, <lb/>
            the priesthood. For it is almost the only occupation of the <lb/>
            priests and ministers of God to offer abstemious sacrifices, <lb/>
            abstaining in the firmness of their minds from wine and from <lb/>
            every other cause of folly. For, says the scripture, " The <lb/>
            Lord spoke unto Aaron, saying, Wine and strong drink shalt <lb/>
            thou not drink, neither thou nor thy sons after thee, when ye <lb/>
            come into the tabernacle of the testimony, or when ye ap­ <lb/>
            proach the altar of sacrifice, so that ye may not die. This <lb/>
            shall be an everlasting law for all your generations to dis­ <lb/>
            tinguish between what is sacred and what is profane, and <lb/>
            between what is pure and what is impure." But Aaron is <lb/>
            the priest, and the interpretation of his name is "mountain­ <lb/>
            oils ; " reasoning occupying itself with sublime and lofty <lb/>
            objects, not on account of the superabundant excess of the <lb/>
            arrogance of empty pride, but by reason of the magnitude <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus x. 8. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="480"/>
            of its virtue, which, elevating the thoughts beyond even <lb/>
            heaven, suffers it not to contemplate anything that is <lb/>
            lowly.</p>
          <p>And no one who is disposed in this manner will ever <lb/>
            voluntarily touch unmixed wine or any other medicine of <lb/>
            folly, for it is inevitable that he must either make one in the <lb/>
            solemn procession and enter the tabernacle, being about to <lb/>
            perform* the rites which may not be seen, or else, that ap­ <lb/>
            proaching the altar he must offer sacrifices of gratitude for <lb/>
            all the public and private blessings which have been showered <lb/>
            upon him; and these things require sobriety and great <lb/>
            presence of mind.</p>
          <p>XXXIII. Therefore, any one may here rightly admire the <lb/>
            expressions in which the command is conveyed. For how <lb/>
            can it be anything but admirable for people, while sober and <lb/>
            masters of themselves, to apply themselves to prayers and to <lb/>
            the offering of sacrifices ? just as on the other hand it is <lb/>
            ridiculous for men to do so when relaxed both in body and <lb/>
            soul by wine; unless indeed as often as servants, and sons, <lb/>
            and subjects, are about to approach masters, and parents, <lb/>
            and sovereigns, they take care to be sober in order not to <lb/>
            offend in either word or deed, lest if they in any respect act <lb/>
            as if contemptuous of their rank, they should be punished, <lb/>
            or to speak in the most moderate manner, should at least <lb/>
            suffer ridicule; and yet any one when about to become the <lb/>
            minister of the Ruler and father of the universe, is not then <lb/>
            to show himself superior to meat, and drink, and sleep, and <lb/>
            all the vulgar necessities of nature, but is to turn aside to <lb/>
            luxury and effeminacy, and imitate the life of the intem­ <lb/>
            perate, and having his eyes weighed down with wine, and his <lb/>
            head shaking, and bending his neck on one side, and belching <lb/>
            from intemperance, and being weak and tottering in his <lb/>
            whole body, is in that condition to approach the sacred puri­ <lb/>
            fications, and altars, and sacrifices. No: such a man may <lb/>
            not without impiety even behold the sacred flame at a <lb/>
            distance.</p>
          <p>But, if indeed one is to understand these things as said not <lb/>
            of the tabernacle or altar of sacrifice which are visible, and <lb/>
            which are made of inanimate and perishable materials, but <lb/>
            of those objects of speculation which are invisible and per­ <note type="footnote"> * There is some corruption in the Greek text here. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="481"/>
            ceptible only by the intellect, of which these other things are <lb/>
            only the images perceptible by the outward senses ; he will <lb/>
            all the more marvel at the explanation. For since the <lb/>
            Creator has in every instance made one thing a model and <lb/>
            another a copy of that model, he has made the archetypal <lb/>
            pattern of virtue for the seal, and then he has on this <lb/>
            stamped an impression from it very closely resembling the <lb/>
            stamp. Therefore, the archetypal seal is the incorporeal <lb/>
            idea being a thing as to its intrinsic nature an object of the <lb/>
            outward senses, but yet not actually coming within the <lb/>
            sphere of their operations. Just as if there is a piece of <lb/>
            wood floating in the deepest part of the Atlantic sea, a <lb/>
            person may say that the nature of wood is to be burned, <lb/>
            but that that particular piece never will be burnt because <lb/>
            of the way in which it is saturated with salt water.</p>
          <p>XXXIV. Let us then look upon the tabernacle and the <lb/>
            altar as ideas, the one being the idea of incorporeal virtue, <lb/>
            and the other as the emblem of an image of it, which is per­ <lb/>
            ceptible by the outward senses. Now it is easy to see the <lb/>
            altar and the things which are on it, for they have all their <lb/>
            preparations out of doors, and are consumed by unquenchable <lb/>
            fire, so as to shine not by day alone, but also by night; but <lb/>
            the tabernacle and all things that are therein are invisible, not <lb/>
            only because these are placed in the innermost recesses and <lb/>
            in the most holy shrines, but also because God has affixed <lb/>
            according to the injunctions of the law, the inevitable punish­ <lb/>
            ment of death, not only to any one who touches them, but <lb/>
            to any one who through the superfluous curiosity of his eyes <lb/>
            beholds them. The only exception is, if any one is perfect <lb/>
            and faultless, unpolluted by any error whether it be great or <lb/>
            small, having a nature entirely even and full, and in all <lb/>
            respects most perfect; for to such a man it is permitted once <lb/>
            in each year to enter in and behold what is invisible to others, <lb/>
            since in him alone of all men the winged and heavenly love <lb/>
            of incorruptible and incorporeal good things abides.</p>
          <p>When, therefore, any one being smitten by the idea is in­ <lb/>
            fluenced by the seal which gives an impression of the par­ <lb/>
            ticular virtues, perceiving, and comprehending, and admiring <lb/>
            the most God-like beauty of that idea which he is approaching, <lb/>
            as having received the impression of that seal, then a forget­ <lb/>
            fulness of ignorance and folly is at once engendered in him, <note type="footnote"> I I </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="482"/>
            accompanied by a simultaneous recollection of instruction <lb/>
            and learning. On which account the scripture says, " Wine <lb/>
            and strong drink thou shalt not drink, neither thou nor thy <lb/>
            sons after thee," when ye enter into the tabernacle of the <lb/>
            testimony or approach the altar of sacrifice; and he goes <lb/>
            through all these details not more by way of prohibition than <lb/>
            of explaining his intention.</p>
          <p>In truth, for one who was issuing prohibitions, it was ap­ <lb/>
            propriate to say, Drink not wine when you are performing <lb/>
            sacrifice; but for one who is declaring his opinion, it is more <lb/>
            suitable to say, Ye shall not drink. For it is impossible for <lb/>
            a man to admit ignorance, which is the cause of intoxication <lb/>
            and of ignorance of the soul, if he be one who studies the <lb/>
            generic and specific virtues and devotes himself to the pursuit <lb/>
            of them. And he very often speaks of the tabernacle of <lb/>
            testimony, in truth, inasmuch as God is the witness of virtue, <lb/>
            to whom it is honourable and expedient to attend, or inas­ <lb/>
            much as it is virtue which implants steadiness in our souls, <lb/>
            eradicating ambiguous, and doubtful, and hesitating, and <lb/>
            vacillating reasonings out of them by force, and revealing <lb/>
            truth in life as in a court of justice.</p>
          <p>XXXV. And the scripture says that, " he shall not die <lb/>
            who offers abstemious sacrifices ;” since ignorance brings <lb/>
            death, and education and instruction- bring immortality. <lb/>
            For as in our own bodies disease is the cause of dissolution, <lb/>
            and health of preservation ; so in the same manner in our <lb/>
            souls also, that which saves is prudence, for this is a kind of <lb/>
            good health of the mind ; and that which destroys is folly, <lb/>
            which inflicts an incurable disease. And he expressly <lb/>
            declares his opinion, and pronounces this last to be an ever­ <lb/>
            lasting evil.* For he considers that there is an undying <lb/>
            law set up and established in the nature of the universe <lb/>
            embracing these principles, that instruction is a salutary <lb/>
            and saving thing, but that ignorance is the cause of disease <lb/>
            and destruction.</p>
          <p>He also besides delivers this further statement, that the <lb/>
            laws which are established in accordance with truth are at <lb/>
            once everlasting; since right reason, which is law, is not <lb/>
            perishable. For also, on the other hand, the contrary thing, <lb/>
            namely lawlessness, is a thing of brief existence, and by its <note type="footnote"> * Leviticus x. 9. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="483"/>
            own intrinsic nature easily destructible, as it is confessed to <lb/>
            be by all persons of sound sense. And it is an especial <lb/>
            property of law and of instruction to distinguish what is <lb/>
            profane from what is holy, and what is unclean from what is <lb/>
            clean; as, on the other hand, it is the effect of lawlessness <lb/>
            and ignorance to combine things that are at variance with <lb/>
            one another by force, and to throw everything into disorder <lb/>
            and confusion.</p>
          <p>XXXVI. On this account the greatest of the kings and <lb/>
            prophets, Samuel, as the sacred scriptures tell us, drank no <lb/>
            wine or intoxicating liquors to the day of his death ;* for he <lb/>
            is enrolled among the ranks of the divine army which he will <lb/>
            never leave in consequence of the prudence of the wise cap­ <lb/>
            tain. But Samuel was perhaps in reality a man, but he is <lb/>
            looked upon not as a compound animal, but as mind rejoic­ <lb/>
            ing only in the service and ministrations of God. For the <lb/>
            name Samuel, being interpreted, means " appointed to God;" <lb/>
            because he looked upon all such actions as are done in <lb/>
            accordance with vain and empty opinions to be shameful <lb/>
            irregularity. He was born of a human mother, whose name <lb/>
            when interpreted means " grace." For without divine grace it <lb/>
            is impossible either to abandon the ranks of mortal things, <lb/>
            or to remain steadily and constantly with those which are <lb/>
            imperishable. But whatever soul is filled with grace is at <lb/>
            once in a state of exultation, and delight, and dancing; for <lb/>
            it becomes full of triumph, so that it would appear to many <lb/>
            of the uninitiated to be intoxicated, and agitated, and to be <lb/>
            beside itself. On which account it was said to it by a young <lb/>
            boy, and that not by one only but by every one who was old <lb/>
            enough for juvenile sauciness and for a readiness to mock at <lb/>
            what is good, " How long will you be drunk ? Put an end to <lb/>
            your wine-bibbing." *</p>
          <p>For in the case of those who are under the influence of <lb/>
            divine inspiration, not only is the soul accustomed to be. <lb/>
            excited, and as it were to become frenzied, but also the body <lb/>
            is accustomed to become reddish and of a fiery complexion, <lb/>
            the joy which is internally diffused and which is exulting, <lb/>
            secretly spreading its affections even to the exterior parts, <lb/>
            by which many foolish people are deceived, and have fancied <lb/>
            that sober persons were intoxicated. And yet indeed those <note type="footnote"> * 1 Samuel i. 14. </note> <note type="footnote"> I I 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="484"/>
            sober people are in a manner intoxicated, having drunk deep <lb/>
            of all good things, and having received pledges from perfect <lb/>
            virtue. But those are intoxicated with that drunkenness <lb/>
            which proceeds from wine, who pass their whole lives without <lb/>
            ever having tasted wisdom, though they have a continued <lb/>
            hunger and desire for it. Very naturally therefore is answer <lb/>
            made to the man who acts with the impetuosity of youth, <lb/>
            and tninks to produce laughter at the venerable and austere <lb/>
            mode of life of prudence, " My good man I am a hard <lb/>
            woman, a severe day, and I drink no wine or strong drink, <lb/>
            and I pour out my soul before the Lord."</p>
          <p>Very great is the freedom of speech of that soul which is <lb/>
            filled with the graces of God. In the first place it calls <lb/>
            itself a severe day, having regard to the boy who is mock­ <lb/>
            ing it; for by him and by every fool the road which leads <lb/>
            to virtue is looked upon as rough and difficult to travel and <lb/>
            most painful, as one of the old poets testifies, saying:- <lb/>
            Vice one may take in troops with ease, <lb/>
            But in fair virtue's front <lb/>
            Immortal God has stationed toil, <lb/>
            And care, and sweat, to bar the road. <lb/>
            Long is the road and steep, <lb/>
            And rough at first, which leads the steps <lb/>
            Of mortal man thereto ; <lb/>
            But when you reach the height, the path <lb/>
            Is easy which before was hard, <lb/>
            And swift the onward course.</p>
          <p>XXXVII. After this the soul goes on to deny that it <lb/>
            drinks wine or strong drink, boasting in its being continu­ <lb/>
            ally sober throughout the whole of its life. For to have <lb/>
            the reasoning powers really free, and unfettered, and pure, <lb/>
            and intoxicated by no passion, was really a very important <lb/>
            and admirable thing. And from this it results that the <lb/>
            mind which is filled with unmixed sobriety is of itself a com­ <lb/>
            plete and entire libation, and is offered as such to and conse­ <lb/>
            crated to God. For what is the meaning of the expression, <lb/>
            "I will pour out my soul before the Lord," but "I will <lb/>
            consecrate it entirely to him?" Having broken all the <lb/>
            chains by which it was formerly bound, which all the empty <lb/>
            anxieties of mortal life fastened around it, and having led it <lb/>
            forth and emancipated it from them, he has stretched, and <lb/>
            extended, and diffused it to such a degree that it reaches <lb/>
             <pb n="485"/>
            even the extreme boundaries of the universe, and is borne <lb/>
            onwards to the beautiful and glorious sight of the uncreate <lb/>
            God. Therefore this company is one of sober persons who <lb/>
            have made instruction their guide; but the former one is a <lb/>
            company of drunkards, whose leader is ignorance.</p>
          <p>XXXVIII. But since intoxication does not only display <lb/>
            folly, which is the child of ignorance, but also utter in­ <lb/>
            sensibility ; and since, again, wine is the cause of that <lb/>
            insensibility which affects the body, while the cause of the <lb/>
            insensibility of the soul is the ignorance of those things with <lb/>
            which it is proper and natural to be acquainted; we must <lb/>
            now say a few words about ignorance, reminding the reader <lb/>
            of only the most important particulars relating to it.</p>
          <p>To which, then, of the passions which affect the body shall <lb/>
            we compare that passion in the soul which is called igno­ <lb/>
            rance ? To the deprivation of the organs of the external <lb/>
            senses ? Therefore all those, who have been injured in their <lb/>
            eyes or ears, are no longer able to see or hear at all, but have <lb/>
            no acquaintance with day or light, which are the only objects <lb/>
            for the sake of which, if we are to tell the plain truth, life is <lb/>
            really desirable, but dwell in lasting darkness and everlast­ <lb/>
            ing night, being made insensible to everything whether of <lb/>
            small or great importance ; men whom ordinary conversation <lb/>
            naturally is accustomed to call infirm.</p>
          <p>For even if all the other faculties of the rest of the body, <lb/>
            should attain to the very extreme limit of strength and <lb/>
            vigour, still, if they are tripped up, as it were, and deprived <lb/>
            of their foundation by the deprivation of the eyes and ears, <lb/>
            they will meet with a great fall, so as never again to be able <lb/>
            to rise; for the things which support man and keep him <lb/>
            erect are in name, indeed, the feet, but in reality the powers <lb/>
            of hearing and seeing; and the man who possesses them in <lb/>
            their complete integrity is awake and stands upright, but he <lb/>
            who is deprived of them falls and will be utterly destroyed. <lb/>
            And ignorance does produce completely similar effects on <lb/>
            the soul, depriving it of its faculties of seeing and of hearing, <lb/>
            and allowing neither light nor reason to enter into it, lest the <lb/>
            one should instruct it and the other should exhibit the truth <lb/>
            to it. But shedding upon it dense darkness and abundant <lb/>
            folly, it renders the most beautiful soul a deaf, and dumb, and <lb/>
            lifeless stone.</p><pb n="486"/>
            
          <p>XXXIX. For knowledge, which is the opposite of igno­ <lb/>
            rance, may be called, in a manner, the eyes and ears of the <lb/>
            soul; for it applies the mind to what is said, and fixes its <lb/>
            eyes upon things as they exist, and cannot endure to form a <lb/>
            false judgment of anything which it either sees or hears. <lb/>
            But it examines and carefully surveys every object which is <lb/>
            worthy of being seen or heard, and even if it be necessary to <lb/>
            sail or to travel over sea and land, it will traverse them to <lb/>
            its furthest boundaries that it may see anything more im­ <lb/>
            portant, or hear anything more modern; for the love of <lb/>
            knowledge admits of no hesitation or delay, it is an enemy <lb/>
            to sleep and a friend to waking. Therefore, continually <lb/>
            rousing up, and awakening, and sharpening the intellect, it <lb/>
            compels it to roam about in every direction, where instruction <lb/>
            is to be obtained, inspiring it with an avidity for hearing, <lb/>
            and infusing into it an insatiable thirst for learning. There­ <lb/>
            fore knowledge causes hearing and seeing, by means of which <lb/>
            faculties success and rectitude of conduct are arrived at; <lb/>
            for he who sees and hears, knowing what is expedient, <lb/>
            chooses that, and rejecting the contrary is benefited by his <lb/>
            knowledge. But ignorance causes to the soul a mutilation <lb/>
            more grievous than the mutilation of the body, and is the <lb/>
            cause of many errors, since it is unable to derive any assist­ <lb/>
            ance from without, either by foreseeing anything, or by any <lb/>
            acuteness of hearing. Therefore, owing to its exceeding <lb/>
            desolateness of condition, it is left utterly undefended and <lb/>
            unprotected, and is exposed to the plots of all kinds of men <lb/>
            and to dangers from all kinds of events. Let us, then, never <lb/>
            drink unmixed wine in such quantities as to cause insensi­ <lb/>
            bility to our outward senses, nor let us alienate ourselves to <lb/>
            such a degree from knowledge as to diffuse ignorance, that <lb/>
            vast and dense darkness, over our souls.</p>
          <p>XL. But there are two kinds of ignorance, one simple, <lb/>
            being complete insensibility; and the other of a twofold <lb/>
            nature, when a man is not only enveloped in ignorance, but <lb/>
            also thinks that he knows what he never has known, being <lb/>
            elated with an ungrounded opinion of his knowledge. The <lb/>
            former evil is the lighter one, for it is the cause of lighter <lb/>
            offences, and of what we may perhaps call involuntary errors ; <lb/>
            but the second is of more importance, for it is the parent of <lb/>
            great evils, and not only of unintentional but also of deli­ <lb/>
             <pb n="487"/>
            berate offences. These are the offences of which Lot, the <lb/>
            the father of daughters, appears to me to be especially guilty, <lb/>
            not being able to nourish a masculine and perfect plant in <lb/>
            his soul; for he had two daughters by his wife, who was after­ <lb/>
            wards turned to stone, whom, using an appropriate appella­ <lb/>
            tion, one may call habit, a nature at variance with truth, and <lb/>
            always, whenever any one tries to lead it on, lagging behind <lb/>
            and looking round upon its ancient and customary ways, and <lb/>
            remaining in the midst of them like a lifeless pillar.</p>
          <p>Of these daughters of his the elder may be called Counsel, <lb/>
            and the younger may be named Assent, for assent follows <lb/>
            upon taking counsel; but no one after he has assented still <lb/>
            takes counsel. Accordingly the mind, when it has taken its <lb/>
            seat in its council chamber, begins to put its daughters in <lb/>
            motion; and with the elder one, namely, Counsel, it begins <lb/>
            to consider and investigate everything; and with the <lb/>
            younger one, Assent, it begins easily to assent to the cir­ <lb/>
            cumstances that arise, and to embrace what is hostile as <lb/>
            though it were friendly, if they only present ever so slight <lb/>
            an attraction of pleasure from this source. But sober <lb/>
            reasoning does not admit these things, but only that reason­ <lb/>
            ing does so which is overcome with wine, and, as it were, <lb/>
            drunk.</p>
          <p>XLI. On which account it is said, " They made their <lb/>
            father drink wine."* That is to say, they brought com­ <lb/>
            plete insensibility on the mind, so that it fancied itself com­ <lb/>
            petent by its own abilities to judge what was expedient, and <lb/>
            to assent to all sorts of apparent facts, as if they really had <lb/>
            solid truth in them; human nature being by no means and <lb/>
            under no circumstances competent either to ascertain the <lb/>
            truth by consideration, or to choose real truth and advantage, <lb/>
            or to reject what is false and the cause of injury; for the <lb/>
            great darkness which is spread over all existing bodies and <lb/>
            things does not permit one to see the real nature of each <lb/>
            thing, but even if any one, under the influence of immoderate <lb/>
            curiosity or of a real love of learning, wishes to emerge from <lb/>
            ignorance and to obtain a closer view, he, like people wholly <lb/>
            deprived of sight, stumbling over what is before his feet, <lb/>
            will fall, and so get behind hand before he can lay hold of <lb/>
            anything; or else, snatching at something with his hands, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xix. 33. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="488"/>
            he will make uncertain guesses, having only conjecture in <lb/>
            the place of truth.</p>
          <p>For even if education, holding a torch to the mind, con­ <lb/>
            ducts it on his way, kindling its own peculiar light, it would <lb/>
            still, with reference to the perception of existing things, do <lb/>
            harm rather than good; for a slight light is naturally liable <lb/>
            to be extinguished by dense darkness, and when the light is <lb/>
            extinguished all power of seeing is useless. Accordingly we <lb/>
            must, on these accounts, remind the man who gives himself <lb/>
            airs by reason of his power of deliberating, or of wisely <lb/>
            choosing one kind of objects and avoiding others, that if the <lb/>
            same unalterable perceptions of the same things always <lb/>
            occurred to us, it might perhaps be requisite to admire the <lb/>
            two faculties of judging which are implanted in us by nature, <lb/>
            namely, the outward senses and the intellect, as unerring <lb/>
            and incorruptible, and never to doubt or hesitate about any­ <lb/>
            thing, but trusting in every first appearance to choose one <lb/>
            kind of thing and to reject the contrary kind. But since we <lb/>
            are found to be influenced in different manners by the same <lb/>
            things at different times, we should have nothing positive to <lb/>
            assert about anything, inasmuch as what appears has no <lb/>
            settled or stationary existence, but is subject to various, and <lb/>
            multiform, and ever-recurring changes.</p>
          <p>XLII. For it follows of necessity, since the imagination <lb/>
            is unstable, that the judgment formed by it must be unstable <lb/>
            likewise ; and there are many reasons for this. In the first <lb/>
            place, the differences which exist'in animals are not in one <lb/>
            particular only, but are unspeakable in point of number, <lb/>
            extending through every part, having reference both to their <lb/>
            creation and to the way in which they are furnished with <lb/>
            their different faculties, and to their way of being supported <lb/>
            and their habits, and to the manner in which they choose <lb/>
            and avoid different things, and to the energies and motions <lb/>
            of the outward senses, and to the peculiar properties of the <lb/>
            endless passions affecting both the soul and body. For <lb/>
            without mentioning those animals which have the faculty of <lb/>
            judgment, consider also some of those which are the objects <lb/>
            of judgment, such as the chameleon and the polypus; for <lb/>
            they say that the former of these animals changes his com­ <lb/>
            plexion so as to resemble the soils over which he is accustomed <lb/>
            to creep, and that the other is like the rocks of the sea-shore <lb/>
             <pb n="489"/>
            to which it clings, nature herself, perhaps, being their saviour, <lb/>
            and endowing them with a quality to protect them from <lb/>
            being caught, namely, with that of changing to all kinds of <lb/>
            complexions, as a defence against evil.</p>
          <p>Again, have you never perceived the neck of the dove <lb/>
            changing colour so as to assume a countless variety of hues <lb/>
            in the rays of the sun ? is it not by turns red, and purple <lb/>
            and fiery coloured, and cinereous, and again pale, and ruddy, <lb/>
            and every other variety of colour, the very names of which <lb/>
            it is not easy to enumerate ? They say indeed that among <lb/>
            the Scythians, among that tribe which is called the Geloni, <lb/>
            most marvellous things happen, rarely indeed, but never­ <lb/>
            theless it does happen; namely that there is a beast seen <lb/>
            which is called the tarandus, not much less than an ox in <lb/>
            size, and exceedingly like a stag in the character of his face. <lb/>
            The story goes that this animal continually changes his coat <lb/>
            according to the place in which he is, or the trees which he <lb/>
            is near, and that in short he always resembles whatever he <lb/>
            is near, so that through the similarity of his colour he <lb/>
            escapes the notice of those who fall in with him, and that it <lb/>
            is owing to this, rather than to any vigour of body, that he <lb/>
            is hard to catch. Now these facts and others which resemble <lb/>
            them are visible proofs of our inability to comprehend every­ <lb/>
            thing.</p>
          <p>XLIII. In the next place, not only are there all these <lb/>
            variations with respect to animals, but there are also <lb/>
            innumerable changes and varieties in men, and great <lb/>
            differences between one man and another. For not only do <lb/>
            they form different opinions respecting the same things at <lb/>
            different times, but different men also judge in different <lb/>
            manners, some looking on things as pleasures, which others <lb/>
            on the contrary regard as annoyances. For the things with <lb/>
            which some persons are sometimes vexed, others delight in, <lb/>
            and on the contrary the things, which some persons are <lb/>
            eager to acquire and look upon as pleasant and suitable, <lb/>
            those very same things others reject and drive to a distance <lb/>
            as unsuitable and ill-omened. At all events I have before <lb/>
            now often seen in the theatre, when I have been there, some <lb/>
            persons influenced by a melody of those who were exhibiting <lb/>
            on the stage, whether dramatists or musicians, as to be <lb/>
            excited and to join in the music, uttering encomiums with­ <lb/>
             <pb n="490"/>
            out intending it; and I have seen others at the same time <lb/>
            so unmoved that you would think there was not the least <lb/>
            difference between them and the inanimate seats on which <lb/>
            they were sitting; and others again so disgusted that they <lb/>
            have even gone away and quitted the spectacle, stopping <lb/>
            their ears with their hands, lest some atom of a sound being <lb/>
            left behind and still sounding in them should inflict <lb/>
            annoyance on their morose and unpleasable souls.</p>
          <p>And yet why do I say this ? Every single individual <lb/>
            among us (which is the most surprising thing of all) is <lb/>
            subject to infinite changes and variations both in body and <lb/>
            soul, and sometimes chooses and sometimes rejects things <lb/>
            which are subject to no changes themselves, but which by <lb/>
            their intrinsic nature do always remain in the same condition. <lb/>
            For the same fancies do not strike the same men when they <lb/>
            are well and when they are ill, nor when they are awake and <lb/>
            when they are asleep, nor when they are young and when <lb/>
            they are old. And a man who is standing still often <lb/>
            conceives different ideas from those which he entertains <lb/>
            when he is in motion; and also when he is courageous, or <lb/>
            when he is alarmed ; again when he is grieved, or when he is <lb/>
            delighted, and when he is in love, he feels differently from <lb/>
            what he does when he is full of hatred. And why need I <lb/>
            be prolix and keep dwelling on these points ? For in short <lb/>
            every motion of both body and soul, whether in accordance <lb/>
            with nature or in opposition to nature, is the cause of a <lb/>
            great variation and change respecting the appearances which <lb/>
            present themselves to us; from which all sorts of incon­ <lb/>
            sistent and opposite dreams arise to occupy our minds.</p>
          <p>XLIV. And that is not the least influential cause of the <lb/>
            instability of one's perceptions which arises from the <lb/>
            position of the objects, from their distance, and from the <lb/>
            places by which they are each of them surrounded. Do we <lb/>
            not see that the fishes in the sea, when they stretch out <lb/>
            their fins and swim about, do always appear larger than their <lb/>
            real natural size? And oars too, even though they are very <lb/>
            straight, look as if they were broken when they are under <lb/>
            water; and things at a great distance display false appear­ <lb/>
            ances to our eyes, and in this way do frequently deceive the <lb/>
            mind. For at times inanimate objects have been imagined <lb/>
            to be alive, and on the contrary living animals have been <lb/>
             <pb n="491"/>
            considered to be lifeless ; sometimes again stationary things <lb/>
            appear to be in motion, and things in motion appear to be <lb/>
            standing still: even things which are approaching towards <lb/>
            us do sometimes appear to be retreating from us, and things <lb/>
            which are going away do on the other hand appear to be <lb/>
            approaching. At times very short things seem to be ex­ <lb/>
            ceedingly long, and things which have many angles appear to <lb/>
            be circular. There is also an infinite number of other things <lb/>
            of which a false impression is given though they are open <lb/>
            to the sight, which however no man in his senses would <lb/>
            subscribe to as certain.</p>
          <p>XLV. What again are we to say of the quantities <lb/>
            occurring in things compounded? For it is through the <lb/>
            admixture of a greater or a lesser quantity that great <lb/>
            injury or good is often done, as in many other instances, so <lb/>
            most especially in the case of medicines compounded by <lb/>
            medical science. For quantity in such compounds is <lb/>
            measured by fixed limits and rules, and it is not safe either <lb/>
            to stop short before one has reached them, nor to advance <lb/>
            beyond them. For if too little be applied, it relaxes, and if <lb/>
            too much, it strains the natural powers; and each extremity <lb/>
            is mischievous, the one from its impotence being capable of <lb/>
            producing any effect at all, and the other by reason of its <lb/>
            exceeding strength being necessarily hurtful.</p>
          <p>Again it is very plain with reference to smoothness, and <lb/>
            roughness, and thickness, and close compression, or on the <lb/>
            other hand leanness and slackness, how very much influence <lb/>
            all these differences have in respect of doing good or harm. <lb/>
            Nor indeed is any one ignorant that scarcely anything what­ <lb/>
            ever of existing things, if you consider it in itself and by <lb/>
            itself, is accurately understood; but by comparing it with <lb/>
            its opposite, then we arrive at a knowledge of its true <lb/>
            nature. As for instance, we comprehend what is meant by <lb/>
            little by placing it in juxta-position with what is great; we <lb/>
            understand what dry is by comparing it with wet, cold by <lb/>
            comparing it with heat, light by comparing it with heavy, <lb/>
            black by contrasting it with white, weak by contrasting it <lb/>
            with strong, and few by comparing it with many.</p>
          <p>In the same way also, in whatever is referred to virtue or <lb/>
            to vice, what is advantageous is recognised by a comparison <lb/>
            with what is injurious, what is beautiful by a comparison <lb/>
             <pb n="492"/>
            with what is unseemly, what is just and generally good, by <lb/>
            placing it in juxta-position with what is unjust and bad. <lb/>
            And, indeed, if any one considers everything that there is in <lb/>
            the world, he will be able to arrive at a proper estimate of <lb/>
            its character, by taking it in the same manner; for each <lb/>
            separate thing is by itself incomprehensible, but by a com­ <lb/>
            parison with another thing, it easy to understand it. Now, <lb/>
            that which is unable to bear witness to itself, but which <lb/>
            stands in need of the advocacy of something else, is not to <lb/>
            be trusted or thought steady. So that in this way those <lb/>
            men are convicted who say that they have no difficulty in <lb/>
            assenting to or denying propositions about anything. And <lb/>
            why need we wonder ? For any one who advances far into <lb/>
            matters, and who contemplates them in an unmixed state <lb/>
            will know this, that nothing is ever presented to our view <lb/>
            according to its real plain nature, but that everything has <lb/>
            the most various possible mixtures and combinations.</p>
          <p>XLVI. Some one will say, We at once comprehend <lb/>
            colours. How so ? Do we not do so by means of the <lb/>
            external things, air and light, and also by the moisture <lb/>
            which exists in our eyes themselves ? And in what way <lb/>
            are sweet and bitter comprehended ? Is it apart from the <lb/>
            moisture in our mouths ? And as to all the flavours which <lb/>
            are in accordance with, or at variance with nature, are not <lb/>
            they in the same case ? What, again, are we to say of the <lb/>
            smells arising from perfumes which are burnt ? Do they ex­ <lb/>
            hibit plain unmixed simple natures, or rather qualities com­ <lb/>
            pounded of themselves and of the air, and sometimes also of <lb/>
            the fire which consumes their bodies, and also of the faculty <lb/>
            existing in our own nostrils ?</p>
          <p>From all this we collect the inference that we have <lb/>
            neither any proper comprehension of colours, not only of <lb/>
            the combination which consists of the objects submitted to <lb/>
            our view and of light; nor of smells, but only of the mixture <lb/>
            which consists of that which flows from substances and the <lb/>
            all-receiving air; nor of tastes, but only of the union which <lb/>
            arises from the tasteable object presented to us, and the <lb/>
            moist substance in our mouths.</p>
          <p>XLVII. Since, then, this is the state of affairs with <lb/>
            respect to these matters, it is worth while to appreciate cor­ <lb/>
            rectly the simplicity, or rashness, or impudence of those who <lb/>
             <pb n="493"/>
            pretend to be able with ease to form an opinion, so as to <lb/>
            assent to or deny what is stated with respect to anything <lb/>
            whatever. For if the simple faculties are wanting, but the <lb/>
            mingled powers and those which are formed by contri­ <lb/>
            butions from many sources are within sight, and if it is <lb/>
            impossible for those which are invisible to be seen, and if <lb/>
            we are unable to comprehend separately the character of all <lb/>
            the component parts which are united to make up each <lb/>
            faculty, then what remains except that we must think it <lb/>
            necessary to suspend our judgment ? And then, too, do not <lb/>
            those facts which are diffused over nearly the whole world, <lb/>
            and which have caused both to Greeks and barbarians such <lb/>
            erroneous judgments, exhort us not to be too ready in <lb/>
            giving our credence to what is not seen ? And what are <lb/>
            these facts ? Surely they are the instructions which we <lb/>
            have received from our childhood, and our national customs <lb/>
            and ancient laws, of which it is admitted that there is not <lb/>
            a single one which is of equal force among all people ; but it <lb/>
            is notorious that they vary according to the different coun­ <lb/>
            tries, and nations, and cities, aye, and even still more, in <lb/>
            every village and private house, and even with respect to men, <lb/>
            and women, and infant children, in almost every point. At all <lb/>
            events, what are accounted disgraceful actions among us, <lb/>
            are by others looked upon as honourable; what we think <lb/>
            becoming, others call unseemly; what we pronounce just, <lb/>
            others renounce as iniquitous ; others think our holy actions <lb/>
            impious, our lawful deeds lawless: and further, what we <lb/>
            think praiseworthy, they find fault with; what we think <lb/>
            worthy of all honour, is, in the eyes of others, deserving of <lb/>
            punishment; and, in fact, they think most things to be of a <lb/>
            contrary character to what we think.</p>
          <p>And why need I be prolix and dwell further on this sub­ <lb/>
            ject, when I am called off by other more important points ? <lb/>
            If then, any one, leaving out of the question all other more <lb/>
            remarkable subjects of speculation, were to choose to devote <lb/>
            his time to an investigation of the subject here proposed, <lb/>
            namely, to examine the education, and customs, and laws of <lb/>
            every different nation, and country, and place, and city; of <lb/>
            all subjects and rulers; of all men, whether renowned or <lb/>
            inglorious, whether free or slaves, whether ignorant or en­ <lb/>
            dowed with knowledge, he would spend not one day or two, <lb/>
             <pb n="494"/>
            nor a month, nor even a year, but his whole life, even <lb/>
            though he were to reach a great age, in the investigation ; <lb/>
            and he would nevertheless still leave a vast number of <lb/>
            subjects unexamined, uninvestigated, and unmentioned, <lb/>
            without perceiving it. Therefore, since there are some <lb/>
            persons and things removed from other persons and things, <lb/>
            not by a short distance only, but since they are utterly dif­ <lb/>
            ferent, it then follows of necessity that the perceptions <lb/>
            which occur to men of different things must also differ, and <lb/>
            that their opinions must be at variance with one another.</p>
          <p>XLVIII. And since this is the case, who is so foolish and <lb/>
            ridiculous as to affirm positively that such and such a thing <lb/>
            is just, or wise, or honourable, or expedient ? For whatever <lb/>
            this mail defines as such, some one else, who from his child­ <lb/>
            hood, has learnt a contrary lesson, will be sure to deny. <lb/>
            But I am not surprised if a confused and mixed multitude, <lb/>
            being the inglorious slave of customs and laws, however <lb/>
            introduced and established, accustomed from its very cradle <lb/>
            to obey them as if they were masters and tyrants, having <lb/>
            their souls beaten and buffeted, as it were, and utterly <lb/>
            unable to conceive any lofty or magnanimous thoughts, <lb/>
            believes at once every tradition which is presented to it, and <lb/>
            leaving its mind without any proper training, assents to and <lb/>
            denies propositions without examination and without delibe­ <lb/>
            ration. But even if the multitude of those who are called <lb/>
            philosophers, pretending that they are really seeking for <lb/>
            certainty and accuracy in things, being divided into ranks <lb/>
            and companies, come to discordant, and often even to diame­ <lb/>
            trically opposite decisions, and that too, not about some one <lb/>
            accidental matter, but about almost everything, whether <lb/>
            great or small, with respect to which any discussion can <lb/>
            arise.</p>
          <p>For when some persons affirm that the world is infinite, <lb/>
            while others pronounce it to be confined within limits; or <lb/>
            while some look upon the world as uncreated, and others <lb/>
            assert that it is created ; or when some persons look upon it <lb/>
            as destitute of any ruler and superintendent, attributing to <lb/>
            it a motion, deprived of reason, and proceeding on some <lb/>
            independent internal impulse, while others think that there <lb/>
            is a care of and providence, which looks over the whole and <lb/>
            its parts of marvellous power and wisdom, God ruling and <lb/>
             <pb n="495"/>
            governing the whole, in a manner free from all stumbling, <lb/>
            and full of protection.</p>
          <p>How is it possible for any one to affirm that the com­ <lb/>
            prehension of such objects as are brought before them, is the <lb/>
            same in all men ?</p>
          <p>And again, the imaginations which are occupied with the <lb/>
            consideration of what is good, are not they compelled to <lb/>
            suspend their judgment rather than to agree ? While some <lb/>
            think that it is only what is good that is beautiful, and <lb/>
            treasure that up in the soul, and others divide it into <lb/>
            numbers of minute particles, and extend it as far as the <lb/>
            body and external circumstances. These men affirm that <lb/>
            such pieces of prosperity as are granted by fortune, are the <lb/>
            body-guards of the body, namely strength and good health, <lb/>
            and that the integrity and sound condition of the organs of <lb/>
            the external senses, and all things of that kind, are the <lb/>
            guards of that princess, the soul; for since the nature of <lb/>
            good is divided according to three divisions, the third and <lb/>
            outermost is the champion and defender of the second and <lb/>
            yielding one, and the second in its turn is a great bulwark <lb/>
            and protection to the first; and about these very things, and <lb/>
            about the different ways of life, and about the ends to which <lb/>
            all actions ought to be referred, and about ten thousand <lb/>
            other things which logical, and moral, and natural philo­ <lb/>
            sophy comprehends, there have been an unspeakable number <lb/>
            of discussions, as to which, up to the present time, there <lb/>
            is no agreement whatever among all these philosophers who <lb/>
            have examined into such subject.</p>
          <p>XLIX. Is it not then strictly in accordance with nature <lb/>
            that while its two daughters, Counsel and Assent, were agreed <lb/>
            together, and sleeping together, the mind is introduced as <lb/>
            embarrassed by an ignorance of all knowledge ? for we <lb/>
            read in the scripture, " They knew not when they lay down, <lb/>
            or when they rose up."* For it was not likely that in his <lb/>
            state he could clearly and distinctly comprehend either sleep <lb/>
            or waking, or a stationary position or motion; but when <lb/>
            he appears to have come to an opinion in the best manner, <lb/>
            then above all other times is he found to be most foolish, since <lb/>
            his affairs then come to an end, by no means resembling <lb/>
            that which was expected; and whenever he has decided on <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xix. 35. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="496"/>
            assenting to some things as true, then he incurs a reproach <lb/>
            and condemnation for his facility in adopting opinions, those <lb/>
            things which he previously believed as most certain now <lb/>
            appearing untrustworthy and uncertain ; so that, as matters <lb/>
            are in the habit of turning out contrary to what was <lb/>
            expected, the safest course appears to be to suspend one's <lb/>
            judgment.</p>
          <p>L. Having now discussed these matters sufficiently, let <lb/>
            us turn to what follows the points already examined. We <lb/>
            said, then, that under the name of drunkenness was signified <lb/>
            that covetousness and greediness, which has often greatly <lb/>
            injured many persons, and the votaries of which one may see, <lb/>
            even though they may be amply filled in all the channels of <lb/>
            thejr bodies, still unsatisfied and empty as to their desires. <lb/>
            These men, if, being distended by the abundance of the <lb/>
            things which they have devoured, they nevertheless get <lb/>
            breath again for a short time, like wrestlers who are tired, <lb/>
            soon descend again to the same contest.</p>
          <p>Moreover, the king of the Egyptian country, that is of <lb/>
            the body, appearing to the minister of drunkenness, his cup- <lb/>
            bearer, to be angry with him; again at no great distance of <lb/>
            time is represented in the sacred scriptures as reconciled to <lb/>
            him remembering that passion which breaks down the <lb/>
            appetites in the day of his perishable creation, not in the <lb/>
            imperishable light of the uncreated luminary; for it is said <lb/>
            that it was Pharaoh's birth-day,* when he sent for the <lb/>
            chief butler out of his prison, that he might appear at his <lb/>
            banquet; for it is a peculiar characteristic of the man who is <lb/>
            devoted to the passions, to think created and perishable <lb/>
            things beautiful, because he is enveloped in night and dense <lb/>
            darkness, as to the knowledge of imperishable things. On <lb/>
            which account he embraces drunkenness as the beginning <lb/>
            of all pleasures, and its minister the cup-bearer.</p>
          <p>LI. Now there are three companions of and servants of <lb/>
            the intemperate and incontinent soul, the chief baker, the <lb/>
            chief cook, and the chief butler, whom the admirable Moses <lb/>
            mentions in these words, "And Pharoah was angry with the <lb/>
            two eunuchs, with the chief butler, and with the chief <lb/>
            baker, and he put them in prison with the chief cook;" and <lb/>
            the chief cook is eunuch; for he says in another place, <note type="footnote">* Genesis xl. 20.' </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="497"/>
            " And Joseph was brought down to Egypt, and a eunuch <lb/>
            became his master, Pharaoh's chief cook,"* and again, they <lb/>
            sold Joseph to Pharaoh's eunuch, the chief cook; t and <lb/>
            why is it that the aforesaid offices are absolutely com­ <lb/>
            mitted to one who is neither man nor woman? Is it <lb/>
            because men are by nature calculated to sow seed, and <lb/>
            woman to receive it, and that the meeting of the two to­ <lb/>
            gether is the cause of the generation, and also of the <lb/>
            duration of all animals ? But it belongs to an unproductive <lb/>
            and barren soil, or one may rather say to one which has been <lb/>
            made a eunuch, to delight in costly meats and drinks, and <lb/>
            in superfluous extravagant preparations of delicacies, since <lb/>
            it is unable in reality either to scatter the masculine seeds <lb/>
            of virtue, or to receive and nourish them after they have <lb/>
            been shed upon it; but, like a rough and stony field, only <lb/>
            to destroy those things which ought to have lived for ever.</p>
          <p>And it is laid down as a doctrine of the most general <lb/>
            applicability and usefulness, that every author of pleasure <lb/>
            is unproductive of wisdom, being neither male nor female, <lb/>
            because it is incompetent either to give or to receive the <lb/>
            seeds which have a tendency to incorruptibility, but is able <lb/>
            only to study the most disgraceful habits of life, to destroy <lb/>
            what ought to be indestructible, and to extinguish the <lb/>
            torches of wisdom, which ought to be enduring and in­ <lb/>
            extinguishable. None of such persons does Moses permit <lb/>
            to come into the assembly of God ; for he says that, " A <lb/>
            man who is bruised or castrated shall not enter into the <lb/>
            assembly of the Lord.”‡</p>
          <p>LII. For what advantage is there, from the hearing of the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures, to a man who is destitute of wisdom, <lb/>
            whose faith has been eradicated, and who is unable to pre­ <lb/>
            serve that deposit of doctrines most advantageous to all <lb/>
            human life ? Now, there are three persons who contribute <lb/>
            to the conviviality of the human race,-the chief baker, the <lb/>
            cup-bearer, and the maker of delicacies: very naturally, <lb/>
            since we desire the use and enjoyment of three things­ <lb/>
            meat, confections, and drink. But some men only desire <lb/>
            that indispensable food which we use of necessity for the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxxix. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> f Genesis xxxvii. 36. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Deut. xxiii. 1. </note> <note type="footnote"> K K </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="498"/>
            sake of our health, and in order to avoid living in an <lb/>
            illiberal manner. Others again desire immoderate and <lb/>
            exceedingly extravagant luxuries, which, breaking through <lb/>
            the appetites, and weighing down, and overwhelming the chan­ <lb/>
            nels of the body by their number, usually become the parents <lb/>
            of all sorts of terrible diseases.</p>
          <p>Those, therefore, who are inexperienced in pleasure and <lb/>
            the indulgence of the appetites and diseases, like the com­ <lb/>
            mon people in cities, living a life free alike from hatred <lb/>
            and from annoyances, as frugal people, have no need of all <lb/>
            kinds of various ministers of refined skill, being contented <lb/>
            with ordinary cooks, and cup-bearers, and confectioners.</p>
          <p>But they who think that the most important and royal <lb/>
            object of life is to live pleasantly, and who refer everything, <lb/>
            whether of great or small importance, to this object, desire <lb/>
            to avail themselves of the services of chief cooks and chief <lb/>
            cupbearers, and chief confectioners, that is to say, of men <lb/>
            possessed of the highest degree of skill in the arts which <lb/>
            they profess. For those who are skilful in the making of con­ <lb/>
            fections and luxuries invent the most various possible kinds <lb/>
            of cheese-cakes, and honey cakes, and of innumerable other <lb/>
            sweetmeats, varying from one another, not merely in the <lb/>
            difference of their material, but also in the manner in which <lb/>
            they are made, and in their shape, in such a way as not only <lb/>
            to please the taste, but also to beguile the eye. And again, <lb/>
            the contrivances displayed in the examination of different <lb/>
            kinds of wine to produce some, the effect of which shall <lb/>
            speedily go off, and which shall not produce headache, but, <lb/>
            on the contrary, shall be devoid of any tendency to heat the <lb/>
            blood, and shall be very fragrant, admitting either a copious <lb/>
            or a scanty admixture with water, according as the object is <lb/>
            to have a strong and powerful draught, or a gentle and <lb/>
            imperceptible one. And all the other devices and inven­ <lb/>
            tions of cup-bearers all come to the same end of art. And <lb/>
            to cook up and prepare fish, and birds, and similar viands, in <lb/>
            every variety of manner, and to make all other kinds of <lb/>
            sweetmeats and delicacies, we have plausible confectioners <lb/>
            of exceeding skill; and there arc thousands of other luxuries <lb/>
            which they are clever at contriving, besides those which <lb/>
            they have heard of or seen made by others, having devised <lb/>
            them themselves out of their continued care and attention <lb/>
             <pb n="499"/>
            to the object of making life luxurious, and effeminate, and <lb/>
            not worth living.</p>
          <p>LIII. But all these men have been now spoken of as <lb/>
            eunuchs, being utterly barren of wisdom. But the mind, with <lb/>
            which the king of the belly makes a treaty and agreement, <lb/>
            was the cup-bearer ; for by its own nature, the human race is <lb/>
            very fond of wine, and this is the sole thing of which it is im­ <lb/>
            measurably insatiable, since there is no one who is impossible <lb/>
            to be satisfied with sleep, and eating, and carnal enjoyments, <lb/>
            and things like these; but nearly every one is insatiably <lb/>
            fond of wine, and especially those who are occupied with <lb/>
            serious business; for after they have drunk they are still <lb/>
            thirsty, and they begin drinking at first out of small cups, <lb/>
            then, as they proceed, they tell their servants to bring them <lb/>
            wine in larger goblets, and when they are pretty full and <lb/>
            getting riotous, being no longer able to restrain themselves, <lb/>
            they take bowls and goblets of all the largest sizes that they <lb/>
            can get, and drink the wine unmixed in huge draughts, <lb/>
            until they are either overcome by deep sleep, being no longer <lb/>
            able to govern themselves, or till what they have poured into <lb/>
            themselves is vomited out again through repletion. But <lb/>
            even then, nevertheless, the insatiable desire which exists <lb/>
            within them continues to rage as though it were still under <lb/>
            the influence of hunger. " For their wine is of the vine of <lb/>
            Sodom," as Moses says, " and their tendrils are from Gomor­ <lb/>
            rah ; their grapes are grapes of gall, and their branches are <lb/>
            bitter branches. The rage of dragons is their wine, and the <lb/>
            incurable fury of serpents." *</p>
          <p>The interpretation of the name Sodom is " barrenness and <lb/>
            blindness." But Moses here compares those who are the <lb/>
            slaves of greediness for wine and general gluttony, and of <lb/>
            other most disgraceful pleasures to a vine, and to the different <lb/>
            products of the vine ; and the enigmatical meaning which <lb/>
            he conceals under this allegory is this : — There is no plant <lb/>
            of true joy naturally implanted in the soul of the bad man ; <lb/>
            inasmuch as it has no healthy roots, but only such as are <lb/>
            burnt and reduced to ashes, since, instead of water, Heaven <lb/>
            has poured upon it the fire of lightning which cannot <lb/>
            be quenched, God having adjudged that as fitting punishment <lb/>
            for the impious. But there is implanted in it the plant <note type="footnote"> * Deuteronomy xxxii. 32. </note> <note type="footnote"> K K 2 </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="500"/>
            of excessive desire, barren of all good things, and destitute <lb/>
            of anything deserving of regard or contemplation, which <lb/>
            he here compares to a vine. Not meaning that one <lb/>
            which is the parent of eatable fruit, but that one which <lb/>
            produces bitterness, and wickedness, and ungodly cunning; <lb/>
            and which is most fertile in anger, and fury, and the most <lb/>
            savage dispositions; biting the soul like an asp or a viper, <lb/>
            inflicting envenomed wounds, utterly incurable.</p>
          <p>For which wounds, however, we pray that a relief may be <lb/>
            found by propitiating the all-merciful God, in order that he <lb/>
            may destroy this wild vine, and may condemn the eunuchs <lb/>
            and all persons who are barren of virtue to everlasting <lb/>
            punishment; and that, instead of them he may implant in <lb/>
            our souls the valuable trees of right instruction, and may <lb/>
            bestow upon us noble and masculine reason as its fruit, such <lb/>
            as is able to bear within it good actions by way of seed, and <lb/>
            is able to increase the virtues, and is calculated to maintain <lb/>
            and preserve for ever the entire connection and system of <lb/>
            happiness.</p>

            <title type="main">A TREATISE ON THE WORDS THAT NOAH AWOKE FROM HIS WINE, OR ON SOBRIETY.</title>
          </head>
          <p>I. HAVING examined in the preceding treatise what has <lb/>
            been said by the lawgiver about wine and the nakedness <lb/>
            which attends upon it, we will now begin to connect the <lb/>
            the following essay with the statements advanced in that <lb/>
            work.</p>
          <p>Now in the sacred scriptures we come to the following <lb/>
            words immediately after the account we have just been <lb/>
            examining, " And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew all <lb/>
            that his younger son had done to him. "* Sobriety is con­ <lb/>
            fessed to be a most advantageous thing, not only for souls <lb/>
            but also for bodies, for it drives away the diseases which arise <lb/>
            from immoderate repletion, and it sharpens the outward senses <lb/>
            to an exceeding degree of acuteness, and it altogether prevents <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 23. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="501"/>
            bodies from being weighed down so as to fall, but keeps them <lb/>
            light, and raises them up, and incites them to the exercise of <lb/>
            their appropriate energies, implanting in every part a prompt­ <lb/>
            ness and vigour; and in short, sobriety is the cause of exactly <lb/>
            as many good things, as drunkenness, on the contrary, is of <lb/>
            evils.</p>
          <p>Since then sobriety is most advantageous to those bodies <lb/>
            to which the drinking of wine is naturally suitable, is it not <lb/>
            much more so to souls, with which all perishable food is incon­ <lb/>
            sistent ; for what thing in human nature can be more noble <lb/>
            than a sober mind ? what glory can be more glorious ? what <lb/>
            wealth can be more rich ? what authority more power­ <lb/>
            ful ? what strength more vigorous ? of all admirable things <lb/>
            what can be more admirable? Let there only be the eye of the <lb/>
            soul fit to act, which is able to penetrate every where and to <lb/>
            open every thing, being in no part hindered or dimmed by <lb/>
            the suffusion of its own moisture ; for being then most <lb/>
            exceedingly sharp sighted as to its comprehension, and look­ <lb/>
            ing into wisdom itself, it will meet with images such as are <lb/>
            intelligible only by the intellect, the contemplation of which <lb/>
            attracts the soul and will not suffer it any longer to turn <lb/>
            aside to the objects which belong to the outward senses.</p>
          <p>And why should we wonder if there is no created thing <lb/>
            equal in honour to a man who is sober in his soul, and gifted <lb/>
            with acute vision ? for the eyes of the body and the light <lb/>
            which is appreciable by the outward senses are honoured in <lb/>
            an excessive degree by all of us. Accordingly, many who <lb/>
            have lost their sight, have voluntarily also thrown away life, <lb/>
            thinking as far as they were concerned, that death itself was <lb/>
            a lighter evil than such deprivation. In proportion then as <lb/>
            the soul is superior to the body, in the same proportion also <lb/>
            is the mind better than the eyes ; and the mind while it is <lb/>
            free from injury and imperfection, not being oppressed by <lb/>
            any of the iniquities or passions which are produced by <lb/>
            insane drunkenness, renounces sleep as a thing which causes <lb/>
            forgetfulness and hesitation in what is to be done; but it <lb/>
            embraces wakefulness, and uses acuteness of vision, with <lb/>
            respect to every object worthy of being beheld, being kept <lb/>
            awake by exceedingly perfect memory, and committing <lb/>
            actions which are in accordance with the knowledge that it <lb/>
            acquires.</p><pb n="502"/>
            
          <p>II. Such then is the condition of the sober man; but <lb/>
            when Moses speaks of Noah's " younger son, " he is not so <lb/>
            much meaning to make a statement respecting his age, as to <lb/>
            show the disposition with which those persons are endued <lb/>
            who are inclined to innovation; since how could he have <lb/>
            forced himself to see, what ought not to be seen, in defiance <lb/>
            of all law and justice, or to divulge what ought to have been <lb/>
            concealed in silence, or to bring to light what might have <lb/>
            been kept in the shade at home, and to transgress all the <lb/>
            boundaries which should confinc the soul, if he had not been <lb/>
            eager for change and innovation, laughing at what happens <lb/>
            to others when he ought rather to lament over such acci­ <lb/>
            dents, and not to ridicule things which it was more natural <lb/>
            and decent and proper to grieve for. In many places indeed <lb/>
            of the exposition of the law, Moses speaks of those who are <lb/>
            somewhat advanced in age as young men, and on the other <lb/>
            hand those who are not yet arrived at old age he entitles <lb/>
            elders; not having regard to the number of their years, <lb/>
            whether it be a short or a very long time that they have lived, <lb/>
            but to the faculties of their soul, according to the way in <lb/>
            which it is influenced, whether it be for good or for evil. <lb/>
            Accordingly he calls Ishmael when he has now lived a space <lb/>
            of nearly twenty years a child, speaking by a comparison <lb/>
            with Isaac who is perfect in virtue ; for, says he, " he took <lb/>
            bread, and a skin of water, and gave it to Agar, and put it <lb/>
            upon her shoulder, and the child also, when Abraham sent <lb/>
            them forth from his house."* And again he says, " She put <lb/>
            the child down under a pine tree;" and further on he <lb/>
            says, “that I may not see the death of the child."</p>
          <p>And yet before Ishmael was born and circumcised, thirteen <lb/>
            years before the birth of Isaac, and having been now weaned <lb/>
            for more than seven years, he was banished with his mother, <lb/>
            because he being illegitimate was mocking the legitimate <lb/>
            son, as though he were on terms of equality with him. But <lb/>
            nevertheless, though in reality a young man, he is still called <lb/>
            a child, being as it were a sophist put in comparison with a <lb/>
            wise man ; for Isaac received wisdom for his inheritance, and <lb/>
            Ishmael sophistry, as when we define the characters of each <lb/>
            we purpose to show in certain dialogues. For the same <lb/>
            relation which a completely infant child bears to a full-grown <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxi. 14. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="503"/>
            man, the same does a sophist bear to a wise man, and the <lb/>
            encyclical branches of education to real knowledge in <lb/>
            virtue.</p>
          <p>III. And again in his great song he calls the whole <lb/>
            people, when it is smitten with a desire of innovation by the <lb/>
            name suited to foolish and infant age, entitling them " chil­ <lb/>
            dren." "For," says he, " the Lord is just and holy; have <lb/>
            they not sinned against him, blameworthy children that they <lb/>
            are ? 0 crooked and perverse generation, is this the requital <lb/>
            that ye offer to the Lord ? is the people so foolish and not <lb/>
            wise?”* Therefore, he here distinctly calls those men <lb/>
            children who deserve blame and have guilt in their souls, <lb/>
            and who through folly and senselessness commit many errors <lb/>
            in their actions which are not according to uprightness of <lb/>
            life; not having regard to the bodily age of the children, <lb/>
            but to the irrational and really childish condition of their <lb/>
            minds.</p>
          <p>Thus indeed, Rachel also, that is beauty of body, is repre­ <lb/>
            sented as younger than Leah, who is beauty of soul. For <lb/>
            the beauty of the body is mortal, but that of the soul is im­ <lb/>
            mortal ; and all the things which are accounted honourable <lb/>
            when judged of with reference to the outward senses, are all <lb/>
            taken together inferior to the one single thing, the beauty <lb/>
            of the soul. And it is in accordance with this principle that <lb/>
            Joseph is always spoken of as young and as "the youngest."t <lb/>
            For when he manages the flock " with his illegitimate <lb/>
            brethren,”‡ he is called young; and when his father prays <lb/>
            for him, he says, " My youngest son whom I have prayed <lb/>
            for, return to me." This is the champion of all the power <lb/>
            of the body and the unflattering companion of the abundant <lb/>
            supply of external things, who has not yet found out any <lb/>
            perfect good more valuable and honourable than that of the <lb/>
            elder soul; for if he had found it, he would have departed <lb/>
            and abandoned the whole of Egypt without ever turning <lb/>
            back.</p>
          <p>But now he chiefly prides himself on his nourishing it and <lb/>
            supporting it as a nurse; and when he who sees beholds the <lb/>
            warlike and authoritative part of it overwhelmed in the sea <lb/>
            and destroyed, he sings a hymn to God.</p>
          <p>It is therefore a juvenile disposition, which is not yet able <note type="footnote"> * Deut. xxxii. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Genesis xlix. 22. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis xxxix. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="504"/>
            to tend the sheep with the legitimate genuine virtues, that is <lb/>
            to say, to govern and superintend the irrational nature exist­ <lb/>
            ing in accordance with the soul, but which still with its ille­ <lb/>
            gitimate brethren, honours the things whieh appear good, in <lb/>
            preference to joining his legitimate brothers and to those <lb/>
            things which really are good. But he is spoken of as <lb/>
            "youngest," even although he keeps on increasing and im­ <lb/>
            proving for the better, in comparison with the perfect man, <lb/>
            who thinks nothing honourable but what is good. On which <lb/>
            aeeount he says in an encouraging manner, by way of exhort­ <lb/>
            ation, " Return to me," a phrase equivalent to, " Desire the <lb/>
            elder opinion." Do not be in everything aiming at inno­ <lb/>
            vation, do now love virtue for herself alone; do not, like a <lb/>
            foolish child dazzled by the splendour of the events of for­ <lb/>
            tune, allow yourself to be filled entirely by deceit and erro­ <lb/>
            neous opinions.</p>
          <p>IV. It has therefore been proved, that in many passages <lb/>
            Moses is in the habit of calling a person young, having <lb/>
            regard not to the age of the body, but to the desire of the <lb/>
            soul for innovation: and also we will now proceed to show <lb/>
            that he calls some persons elders, not because they are op­ <lb/>
            pressed by old age, but as being worthy of honour and <lb/>
            respeet. Who then of those persons, who are acquainted <lb/>
            with the saered seriptures, is ignorant that the wise Abraham <lb/>
            is represented as less long lived than almost any one of his <lb/>
            ancestors ? And yet of all those who lived to the most ex­ <lb/>
            treme old age there is not one, as I think, who is called an <lb/>
            elder, but he alone has this title given to him. Therefore, <lb/>
            the saered seriptures say, that " Abraham was now old and <lb/>
            advanced in years," and, " The Lord blessed Abraham in all <lb/>
            things." * This appears to me to be added as a sort of ex­ <lb/>
            planatory cause for what has been said before, namely, why <lb/>
            the wise man is called the elder. For when the rational part <lb/>
            of the soul is made of a good disposition by the kind provi­ <lb/>
            dence of God, and when it reasons not only about one speeies, <lb/>
            but about everything whieh is presented to it, using older <lb/>
            opinion, it then becomes blessed, and is itself the older part <lb/>
            of the people.</p>
          <p>Thus also he is accustomed to eall the members of the <lb/>
            assembly of the God-loving people which consists of the <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xxiv. 1. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="505"/>
            number of ten sevens, elders. For we read in the scripture <lb/>
            the direction given to Moses, " Assemble for me seventy men <lb/>
            of the elders of Israel, whom you yourself know that they are <lb/>
            elders." * Therefore, it is not only those persons who are <lb/>
            looked upon by ordinary people as old men, inasmuch as <lb/>
            they are hierophants, but those whom the wise man alone <lb/>
            knows, whom he thinks worthy of the appellation of elders. <lb/>
            For those whom he rejects, like a skilful money-changer, from <lb/>
            the coinage of virtue, being alloyed, are all in their souls in­ <lb/>
            clined to innovation; but those whom he wishes to make <lb/>
            friends to himself, are of necessity well tested and approved, <lb/>
            and elders as to their minds.</p>
          <p>V. Therefore, the scripture is seen to prove each particular <lb/>
            of what I have said more plainly to those who have taught <lb/>
            themselves to obey one injunction of the law. “For if," <lb/>
            says the scripture, " a man has two wives, the one beloved <lb/>
            and the other hated, and if she who is beloved bears him a <lb/>
            child, and also she who is hated, and if the child of the wife <lb/>
            who is hated be the first born, then, on the day on which he <lb/>
            bestows on his sons the inheritance of his substance, he <lb/>
            shall not be able to give the share of the first born to the <lb/>
            son of her who is beloved, overlooking his real first born <lb/>
            son, the child of her who is hated; but he must recognize <lb/>
            the son of her who is hated as his first born, to give him a <lb/>
            double share of all the possessions that belong to him, because <lb/>
            he is the beginning of his children, and the rights of the <lb/>
            first born belong to him." t You observe here now that he <lb/>
            never calls the son of the wife that is beloved the first born <lb/>
            or the elder, but he often gives this title to the son of her <lb/>
            who is hated ; and yet he has already pointed out that the <lb/>
            son of her who is beloved was in point of time the first, and <lb/>
            the son of her who is hated the last, at the very beginning <lb/>
            of this injunction ; for he says, " If the beloved wife and <lb/>
            she who is hated both bear children." But nevertheless the <lb/>
            offspring of the first mentioned, even though it may be con­ <lb/>
            siderably earlier in point of time is looked upon as younger <lb/>
            by right reason when it comes to decide between them. But <lb/>
            the offspring of her who is spoken of in the second place, <lb/>
            even though it may come after as to the time of its birth, is <lb/>
            thought worthy of the more important and elder share. <note type="footnote"> * Numbers xi. 16. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Deuteronomy xxi. 15. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="506"/>
            Why so ? because we say that she who is beloved is the <lb/>
            symbol of pleasure, and she who is hated is the emblem of <lb/>
            prudence.</p>
          <p>For the chief multiude of men love the company of the one <lb/>
            to excess, inasmuch as she, from her own treasures, proffers <lb/>
            them most seductive charms and allurements, from the very <lb/>
            first moment of their birth to the extremity of old age; but <lb/>
            of the other they detest excessively the austere and very <lb/>
            dignified look, just as silly children dislike the profitable but <lb/>
            unpleasant reproofs of their parents and guardians. And <lb/>
            both the wives become mothers: the one bringing forth that <lb/>
            disposition in the soul which loves pleasure, and the other <lb/>
            that which loves virtue; but the lover of pleasure is imper­ <lb/>
            fect, and in reality is always a child, even if he reaches a vast <lb/>
            age of many years. But, on the other hand, the lover of <lb/>
            virtue, though he is in old age as to his wisdom, while still <lb/>
            in his swaddling clothes, as the proverb has it, will <lb/>
            never grow old. In reference to which Moses says very <lb/>
            emphatically with respect to the son of virtue, which is <lb/>
            hated by the generality of men, that " he is the beginning <lb/>
            of his children," being, forsooth, the first both in order and <lb/>
            precedency. And to him belong the rights of the first-born <lb/>
            by the law of nature, and not by the lawless principle exist­ <lb/>
            ing among men.</p>
          <p>VI. The prophet, then, in accordance with this law, and <lb/>
            as it were shooting his arrows with happy aim at the <lb/>
            appointed mark, in strict agreement with what has gone <lb/>
            before, represents Jacob as younger in point of age than <lb/>
            Esau (because from our very earliest birth folly is bred up <lb/>
            with us, and the desire of what is honourable is engendered <lb/>
            subsequently), but as older in point of power. In conse­ <lb/>
            quence of which Esau is deprived of his birthright as the <lb/>
            elder son, but Jacob is very naturally invested with it; and <lb/>
            the arrangements made with respect to the sons of Joseph <lb/>
            are consistent, if we examine them carefully and with much <lb/>
            consideration; when the wise man, under the influence of <lb/>
            immediate inspiration, having them both standing before <lb/>
            him, does not put his hands on their heads, directing them <lb/>
            as the youths are straight before him and immediately, but <lb/>
            crossing his hands, so as to touch with his left the head of <lb/>
            the one who appears to be the elder, and with his right that <lb/>
             <pb n="507"/>
            of him who seems the younger; and the elder one in point <lb/>
            of age is called Manasseh, and the younger is called <lb/>
            Ephraim.* And these names, if they are translated into <lb/>
            the Greek language will be found to be symbols of memory <lb/>
            and recollection; for the name Manasseh, being interpreted, <lb/>
            means from forgetfulness," and which by another name is <lb/>
            called "recollection;" for he who comes to a recollection <lb/>
            of what he has forgotten is advancing out of forgetfulness.</p>
          <p>But Ephraim being interpreted means "fruit-bearing," <lb/>
            a most appropriate appellation for memory; because the <lb/>
            fruit which is the most useful and truly eatable for souls is <lb/>
            lasting memory, which never forgets. Memory, therefore, <lb/>
            exists best when meeting with manly and solid natures, in <lb/>
            respect of which it is looked upon as younger, having <lb/>
            been brought forth late ; but forgetfulness and recollection, <lb/>
            almost from the earliest birth of a man, dwell alternately <lb/>
            with every one, on which account recollection has the prece­ <lb/>
            dence in point of time, and is placed on the left hand by the <lb/>
            wise man when he is arranging the two in order; but <lb/>
            memory will share the chief honours of virtue, which the <lb/>
            lover of God, receiving eagerly, will think worthy of a better <lb/>
            portion by himself.</p>
          <p>Therefore, the first man, being become sober, and know­ <lb/>
            ing what his younger son had done to him, imprecates very <lb/>
            terrible curses on him; for, in truth, when the mind reco­ <lb/>
            vers its sobriety, it does in consequence immediately perceive <lb/>
            all that innovating wickedness has previously done to it, <lb/>
            which, while it was intoxicated, it was unable to compre­ <lb/>
            hend.</p>
          <p>VII. We must now then consider whom the wise man <lb/>
            here curses ; for this is one of the matters especially deserv­ <lb/>
            ing of investigation, since he curses not the son who appears <lb/>
            to have done the wrong, but his son, and his own grandson, <lb/>
            of whom he has not mentioned any apparent sin at present, <lb/>
            either small or great; for he who from superfluous curi­ <lb/>
            osity wished to see his father naked, and who laughed at what <lb/>
            he saw, and who divulged what ought properly to have been <lb/>
            concealed in silence, was Ham, the son of Noah ; but he who <lb/>
            bears the blame for the offences committed by the other, <lb/>
            and who reaped the fruit of them in curses is Canaan; for <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlviii. 13. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="508"/>
            it is said, " Cursed is Canaan the son, the servant, the ser­ <lb/>
            vant of servants, shall he be to his brethren."* And yet, as <lb/>
            I said before, what sin had he committed ? But they, <lb/>
            who are accustomed to explain the formal, and literal, <lb/>
            and obvious interpretations of the laws have'perhaps consi­ <lb/>
            dered this by themselves; but we, being guided by right <lb/>
            reason, as it suggests itself to us, will interpret it according <lb/>
            to the explanation which is ready to hand, having just made <lb/>
            this necessary preface.</p>
          <p>VIII. A stationary position and motion differ from one <lb/>
            another ; for the one is a state of tranquillity, but motion is <lb/>
            impetuosity, of which last there are two species-the one <lb/>
            that which changes its place, the other that which is con­ <lb/>
            stantly revolving about the same place. Now habit is closely <lb/>
            akin to the stationary position, and energy to motion; and <lb/>
            what we have here said may be more easily understood by <lb/>
            an appropriate example.</p>
          <p>It is customary to call an architect, or a painter, or a <lb/>
            farmer, or a musician (and so on with other artists), by the <lb/>
            aforesaid name of their profession, even if they remain <lb/>
            inactive, doing nothing in the way of working at their <lb/>
            respective arts, with reference to the skill and knowledge <lb/>
            which they have each of them acquired in their respective <lb/>
            professions; but when the architect has taken a material of <lb/>
            wood and is working it up, and when the painter having <lb/>
            mixed his proper colours on his pallet, paints the figures <lb/>
            which he has in his head ; and when, again, the former <lb/>
            cutting furrows in the earth, throws in the seed, and <lb/>
            plants, cuttings, and shoots of trees; and when, also, by <lb/>
            way of supplying what he has planted with nourishment, lie <lb/>
            waters them and draws up channels of water to their roots, <lb/>
            and does every thing else which a farmer may be expected to <lb/>
            do; and also, when the musician adapts metres, and rhythm, <lb/>
            and all kinds of melody to his flutes, and harps, and other <lb/>
            instruments, and is able even without any manufactured <lb/>
            instruments to use the organ with which he is furnished <lb/>
            by nature by means of his voice which is furnished with all <lb/>
            the tones; and so on with all the other artists, if it were <lb/>
            worth while to mention them separately. In all these cases, <lb/>
            besides the aforesaid names derived from their profession, <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 25. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="509"/>
            other names akin to the former ones are added with refer­ <lb/>
            ence to their work; so that we predicate of the architect <lb/>
            that he builds, of the painter that he portrays, of the <lb/>
            farmer that he cultivates the land, of the musician that he <lb/>
            plays the flute or the harp, or that he sings, or does some­ <lb/>
            thing similar.</p>
          <p>Now, what men are followed by praise and blame ? Is it <lb/>
            not those men who energise and do something ? For when <lb/>
            they succeed they meet with praise; and when, on the other <lb/>
            hand, they fail they incur blame ; but those who are scien­ <lb/>
            tific, without proceeding to action, remain in tranquillity, <lb/>
            having attained this one honour unattended with danger, <lb/>
            namely, peace.</p>
          <p>IX. Therefore, the same assertion applies to those who <lb/>
            live according to folly, and also to all those who live in <lb/>
            accordance with virtue or vice. Those who are prudent, <lb/>
            and temperate, and manly, and just men in their disposi­ <lb/>
            tions are infinite in number, having a happy portion in <lb/>
            nature, and institutions in accordance with the law, and <lb/>
            exerting themselves in invincible and unhesitating labours; <lb/>
            but the beauty which exists in the ideas in their minds they <lb/>
            are not able to display by reason of their poverty, or of <lb/>
            their want of rank, or of some disease of the body, or of <lb/>
            some one of the other disasters which surround human life; <lb/>
            therefore, they being good have got their good things as it <lb/>
            were in bondage and prison.</p>
          <p>But there are others who have them in an unconfined, and <lb/>
            emancipated, and wholly free condition, having unlimited <lb/>
            materials and opportunities for their exhibition. The wise <lb/>
            man having an abundance of private and public assisting <lb/>
            circumstances by which he can display his acuteness and his <lb/>
            wisdom ; the temperate man will make riches which are <lb/>
            usually blind and accustomed to excite and tempt men to <lb/>
            luxury, farsighted for the future: the just man will exer­ <lb/>
            cise authority by which he will for the future be able to <lb/>
            assign to each individual without any hindrance, such a <lb/>
            share of existing things as agrees with his deserts. The <lb/>
            practiser of virtue will display piety, holiness, and a proper <lb/>
            care of the sacred places and of the sacred rites performed <lb/>
            in them.</p>
          <p>But without proper opportunities virtues indeed exist, <lb/>
             <pb n="510"/>
            but they are immoveable and like silver and gold, which is <lb/>
            of no use in the world, because it is treasured up in the <lb/>
            secret recesses of the earth. On the other hand again, one <lb/>
            can see innumerable persons unmanly, intemperate, foolish, <lb/>
            unjust, impious in their minds, but unable fully to display <lb/>
            the disgraceful character of all their vices by reason of the <lb/>
            want of opportunity to sin; but if any important or <lb/>
            frequent opportunities present themselves, then filling earth <lb/>
            and sea to its extremest boundaries with unspeakable <lb/>
            wickedness, and leaving nothing whether great or small <lb/>
            uninjured, they overturn and destroy everything at one <lb/>
            blow. For as the power of fire is quiet when it has no fuel, <lb/>
            but when there are proper materials it blazes up ; so also <lb/>
            all the powers which have reference to the virtue or vice of <lb/>
            the soul are extinguished by want of opportunity, as I have <lb/>
            said before, but are kindled by a favourable occasion and a <lb/>
            happy concurrence of circumstances.</p>
          <p>X. Why then have I said these things, except with the <lb/>
            object of teaching that Ham, the son of Noah, is the name <lb/>
            of wickedness in a state of inactivity, but his grandson, <lb/>
            Canaan, is the name of wickedness in a state of motion? <lb/>
            For Ham being interpreted, means "warm," but Canaan <lb/>
            means “commotion;” and warm in a body implies fever, <lb/>
            but in the soul it implies wickedness. For as I suppose <lb/>
            disease is the foundation of fever, not only of a part but of <lb/>
            the whole body; so also wickedness is a disease of the whole <lb/>
            soul. But at one time it is in a state of tranquillity, and at <lb/>
            another in motion ; now he calls its motion commotion <lb/>
            (<foreign xml:lang="grc">σάλος</foreign>), which in the Hebrew language is called Canaan. <lb/>
            But no lawgiver ever affixes a punishment to wicked men <lb/>
            while in a state of inaction, but only when they are in a <lb/>
            state of motion and practise actions in accordance with <lb/>
            injustice, just as a moderate man would not care about <lb/>
            killing a snake if it were not about to bite him. For we <lb/>
            must leave out of the question, that natural cruelty of soul <lb/>
            which in the case of some persons delights to deal destruc­ <lb/>
            tion upon everything.</p>
          <p>Very appropriately, therefore, the just man will appear <lb/>
            to have launched his curses against his grandson, Canaan. <lb/>
            But I have used the expression " will appear," because in <lb/>
            effect he is cursing his son Ham through the medium of <lb/>
             <pb n="511"/>
            Canaan; for Ham being moved to commit sin does himself <lb/>
            become Canaan. For there is one subject, namely wicked­ <lb/>
            ness, of which one kind is contemplated in a stationary <lb/>
            condition, and the other in motion. But a stationary <lb/>
            condition is antecedent to motion, so that that which is <lb/>
            moved appears to have the relation of offspring to that <lb/>
            which is stationary. In reference to which fact Canaan is, <lb/>
            according to the order of nature, described as the son of <lb/>
            Ham; commotion as the offspring of tranquillity, in order <lb/>
            that the statement made in another passage may be true, <lb/>
            namely, " visiting the iniquities of the fathers upon the sons <lb/>
            to the third and fourth generations."* For against these <lb/>
            accomplishments of, and as it were, children of thoughts, <lb/>
            punishments advance which await them, but which will <lb/>
            hardly seize upon these thoughts which are not carried out <lb/>
            by any action, and which consequently escape accusation.</p>
          <p>On this account, therefore, in the law concerning leprosy <lb/>
            the great and wise Moses speaks of motion and its further <lb/>
            progress and diffusion as unclean, but of tranquillity as <lb/>
            pure. For he says, "If it be diffused over the skin the <lb/>
            priest shall pronounce him polluted. But if the bright <lb/>
            colour remain in its place and be not diffused, fhe shall <lb/>
            pronounce him clean. "t So that, as tranquillity is an <lb/>
            abiding of evils and of the passions within the soul (for <lb/>
            that is what is intimated by leprosy), it is not liable to <lb/>
            reproach ; but its motion and progress are of necessity open <lb/>
            to accusation. There is also something like this in the <lb/>
            sacred scriptures, where the account of the creation of the <lb/>
            universe is given and it is expressed more distinctly. For it <lb/>
            is said to the wicked man, " 0 thou man, thou hast sinned. <lb/>
            Cease to sin:”‡ because sin is condemned with reference to <lb/>
            its being in motion and energising according to wickedness : <lb/>
            but tranquillity is free from blame, and is even preservative <lb/>
            because of its remaining stationary and inactive.</p>
          <p>XI. These things then, I imagine, have now been sufficiently <lb/>
            discussed. Let us now examine the affair of the curses, and <lb/>
            see what the case is with respect to them: "Cursed," says <lb/>
            the scripture, " is Canaan the child; he shall be a servant <lb/>
            to his brethren. Blessed be the Lord God of Shorn; and <lb/>
            Canaan shall be a servant unto them." We said some time <note type="footnote"> * Exodus xx. 5. </note> <note type="footnote"> t Leviticus xiii. 12. </note> <note type="footnote"> ‡ Genesis iv. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="512"/>
            ago that Shem bears the same name as good, being called <lb/>
            not by a special name, but the whole genus of good is his <lb/>
            name; in reference to which, the good is the only thing to <lb/>
            be named, the only thing worthy of a good report and of <lb/>
            glory ; as, on the other hand, evil is the thing with no good <lb/>
            report and with an evil fame.</p>
          <p>Of what prayer then does he think the man worthy who <lb/>
            has received a share of the nature of good ? Surely of some <lb/>
            new and extraordinary benediction, which no mortal is able <lb/>
            to act up to, and from which, almost as from the ocean itself, <lb/>
            abundant and unceasing springs of good things do gush out <lb/>
            ever rising high and overflowing ; for he calls the Lord and <lb/>
            God of the world and of all the things in it, by a particular <lb/>
            grace, the private especial God of Shem. And see now how <lb/>
            this exceeds all imaginable excess; for the man of whom <lb/>
            such a thing is said, almost receives equal honour with the <lb/>
            world ; for when the same being cares for and superintends <lb/>
            them both, it follows of necessity that the two things so <lb/>
            superintended must be of equal honour and importance ; <lb/>
            may we not even say that these gifts are poured out upon <lb/>
            him abundantly ? For the master and benefactor of the <lb/>
            world, perceptible by the external senses, is called by these <lb/>
            appellations, Lord and God; but of the Good which is <lb/>
            appreciable by the intellect, he is merely called the saviour <lb/>
            and benefactor, not the master or lord ; for what is wise is <lb/>
            dearer to God than what is slavish. In reference to which <lb/>
            principle he speaks clearly in the case of Abraham, saying, <lb/>
            " I will not hide from Abraham who is dear to me."* But <lb/>
            the man who has this inheritance has advanced beyond the <lb/>
            bounds of human happiness; for be alone is nobly born, <lb/>
            inasmuch as he has God attributed to him as his father, <lb/>
            and being his adopted only son, he is not rich, but all-wealthy, <lb/>
            dwelling luxuriously in abundance and among genuine good <lb/>
            things, not worn out by age, but in a state of vigour and <lb/>
            continual renewal, such that besides them there is no good; <lb/>
            being a man not of fair reputation, but of exceeding glory <lb/>
            and receiving praise, not of that bastard sort which proceeds <lb/>
            from flattery, but that which is founded on truth.</p>
          <p>He is the only king, having received from the Ruler of all <lb/>
            things an irresistible power, without a rival, and authority <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xviii. 7. </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="513"/>
            over all things. He is the only free man, being emancipated <lb/>
            from that most grievous mistress, vain opinion, whom God <lb/>
            who makes free has torn down, since she was very proud, <lb/>
            from her citadel on high, and has utterly destroyed.</p>
          <p>What then ought a man to do who has been thought <lb/>
            worthy of such great and such exceeding blessings, all <lb/>
            united in his case ? What ought he to do, except requite <lb/>
            his benefactor with words, and hymns, and songs of praise ? <lb/>
            This is as it seems what is obscurely intimated to him in the <lb/>
            words, “Blessed is the Lord God of Shem;"* since it <lb/>
            it becomes him who has received the inheritance of God to <lb/>
            bless and praise him, since this is the only requital that it <lb/>
            is in his power to offer, and since he is utterly unable by <lb/>
            any means whatever to do anything further.</p>
          <p>XII. This, then, is the prayer which Noah offers for <lb/>
            Shem ; let us now see what kind of prayer it is that he puts <lb/>
            forth for Japhet. He says, " May God make Japhet broad, <lb/>
            and let him dwell in the tents of Shem, and Canaan shall be <lb/>
            their servant." The object of a man who thinks nothing <lb/>
            beautiful but what is good is limited and contracted, for of <lb/>
            all the innumerable guides which influence different men he <lb/>
            is confined to one alone, namely, to the mind. But the <lb/>
            object of a man who attributes good to three different kinds <lb/>
            of things, dividing it as it has reference to the soul, and to <lb/>
            the body, and to external things, is more extended, inasmuch <lb/>
            as he cuts np the good into a number of small and dissimilar <lb/>
            fragments ; on which account Noah very appropriately prays <lb/>
            that breadth may be added to him, in order that he may be <lb/>
            able to exercise the virtues of the soul, prudence, and tempe­ <lb/>
            rance, and all the others, and likewise the vigorous health <lb/>
            and acute perceptions of the body, strength and vigour, and <lb/>
            the other qualities akin to them; and also the external ad­ <lb/>
            vantages which contribute to wealth and glory, and to the <lb/>
            enjoyment and use of necessary pleasures.</p>
          <p>XIII. Thus much we may say concerning breadth. We <lb/>
            must now consider who it is who Noah prays may dwell in <lb/>
            the tents of Shem, for he does not say very clearly. One <lb/>
            may affirm that he means the Lord of the universe ; for <lb/>
            what more suitable and beautiful abode in all creation could <lb/>
            be found for God beyond a soul completely purified, and <note type="footnote"> * Genesis ix. 26. </note> <note type="footnote"> L L </note> <lb/>
             <pb n="514"/>
            thinking nothing beautiful but what is good, and looking <lb/>
            upon all things, which are usually held in estimation among <lb/>
            men, in the light of subjects and body-guards of that one <lb/>
            thing, good ? But God is said to dwell in a house, not as in <lb/>
            respect of place (for he contains everything and is contained <lb/>
            by nothing), but as in a most especial degree exerting his <lb/>
            providence and care in favour of that place; for it follows <lb/>
            inevitably in the case of every one who is master of a house <lb/>
            that he has a particular care for that house.</p>
          <p>But let every one, on whom the love of God has showered <lb/>
            good things, pray to God that he may have as a dweller <lb/>
            within him the Ruler of all things, who will raise this small <lb/>
            house, the mind, to a great height above the earth, and will <lb/>
            connect it with the bounds of heaven. And what is said in <lb/>
            the scriptures appears to coincide with this, for Shem is <lb/>
            planted as a root of excellence and virtue; and from this <lb/>
            root there sprang up a tree bringing forth good fruit, namely, <lb/>
            Abraham, of whom the self-instructed and self-teaching off­ <lb/>
            spring, Isaac, was the fruit, by whom again the virtues <lb/>
            which are displayed in labour are sown, the practiser of <lb/>
            which is Jacob, the man trained and exercised in wrestling <lb/>
            with the passions, having the admonitions of angels for his <lb/>
            gymnastic trainers. He is the prince of the twelve tribes, <lb/>
            which the scriptures call the " kingdom and priesthood of <lb/>
            God," * in reference to their agreement with the original <lb/>
            author of their race, Shem, in whose house it was prayed <lb/>
            that God might dwell; for a kingdom is the house of a king, <lb/>
            being truly sacred, and the only house free from danger of <lb/>
            being plundered. Perhaps, indeed, the prayer has reference <lb/>
            also to Japhet, that he also may make his abode in the dwell­ <lb/>
            ings of Shem, for it is well to pray for one who thinks the <lb/>
            good things of the body and external advantages the only <lb/>
            goods, that he may come over to the only true good, that of <lb/>
            the soul, and may not wander from true opinions all his <lb/>
            life, thinking advantages which are common to the most <lb/>
            accursed and worst of men, such as health, and riches, and <lb/>
            all such things as those, goods, when nature has not given <lb/>
            any portion of what is really good to any wicked man; for, <lb/>
            by its own nature, what is good can have no participation in <lb/>
            what is bad. <note type="footnote"> * Exodus six. 6. </note> <pb n="515"/>
            </p>
          <p>On this account good is treasured up in the soul alone, in <lb/>
            the beauty of which no foolish man has any share. Now, the <lb/>
            original progenitor of a virtuous posterity has written that <lb/>
            he prayed for this for some of his friends, saying, " Return <lb/>
            unto me,"* in order that, returning to adopt his opinions, <lb/>
            and looking upon good alone as beautiful, he might pass by <lb/>
            the reports of mistaken men as to the nature of good.</p>
          <p>Let him, then, dwell in the house of him who says that <lb/>
            the good of the soul is the only beautiful thing ; passing by <lb/>
            and repudiating the abodes of others, by whom corporeal <lb/>
            and external advantages are held in honour. And very ap­ <lb/>
            propriately has he assigned the fool to be a slave to those <lb/>
            who cultivate virtue, that, either by passing under a better <lb/>
            government he may live a better life, or if he continue in <lb/>
            evil doing he may easily be punished by the independent <lb/>
            authority of his masters. <note type="footnote"> * Genesis xlix. 22. </note></p>
